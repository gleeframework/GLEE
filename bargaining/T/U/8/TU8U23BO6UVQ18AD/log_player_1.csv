"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take 60% and you can take 40%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than a 60/40 split. Let's try a 55/45 split instead. It's closer to fair and will save us both money from inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a toll on our potential earnings.

I'll consider Bob's proposal, but I'm not convinced it's the best deal for me. I'd like to try to negotiate further. I'll reject this offer and make a counter-proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure 55/45 is fair. How about a 52.5/47.5 split?""
}
```

Now it's up to Bob to respond!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise further. Let's try a 52.5/47.5 split, as I suggested before. It's a fair and reasonable split, and we can avoid further negotiations.""
}
```

I'm sticking to my previous proposal, hoping that Bob will accept this time."
