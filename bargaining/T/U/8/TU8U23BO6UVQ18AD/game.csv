450000.0,550000.0,I think we can both do better than a 60/40 split. Let's try a 55/45 split instead. It's closer to fair and will save us both money from inflation.,Bob,2,
,,I'm not sure 55/45 is fair. How about a 52.5/47.5 split?,Alice,2,reject
520000.0,480000.0,"I'm willing to compromise further. Let's try a 52.5/47.5 split, as I suggested before. It's a fair and reasonable split, and we can avoid further negotiations.",Alice,3,
