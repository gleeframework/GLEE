"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

This way, I get 80% of the original $100, and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 10$ is worth even less than I initially thought.

I'll reject Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, my gain is worth even less now. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking its toll. With my gain being worth 14.26% less than the original $80, it's a relatively small amount. Bob's offer is still quite skewed towards him, but I'll consider it.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
