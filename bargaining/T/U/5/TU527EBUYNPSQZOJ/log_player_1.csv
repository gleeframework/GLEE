"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
```

I propose to keep almost all of the money, giving Bob only $1000. I reason that since I get to make the first proposal, I can set the bar very high and Bob will likely accept to avoid getting nothing in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}

While I would prefer more money, the inflation factor is a serious consideration.  The offer of $500,000 is a significant amount, and it's likely I won't get a better deal in the next round. It's also possible Bob will offer less in the next round.  It's a good compromise."
