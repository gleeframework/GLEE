""bob_gain"": 900000,
""alice_gain"": 100000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we divide the money in a way that's fairer than the previous offers. I'll take $625000 and you'll receive $375000. This maintains a reasonable balance considering the diminishing value of the money in each subsequent round. 
# Bob gain: 375000 
# Alice gain: 625000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
