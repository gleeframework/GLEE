"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 20% and take the rest.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 80% of the initial $10,000, and Bob will get 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going for 50/50 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my share is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so the effective amount I'd get from Bob's offer is:

4000 / 0.9 = 4444.44

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer or not. I'd rather not give up 60% of the remaining amount, but I also don't want to risk going to the next round and potentially getting less.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my share is now worth 81% of what it was in the first round, so I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the erosion of value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I need to account for inflation.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll try to get closer to the original 50/50 split, but I still want a bit more 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my share is now worth 72.9% of what it was in the first round. Bob's offer is:

4500 / 0.729 = 6177.17

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer or not. I'd rather not give up more than 55% of the remaining amount, but I also don't want to risk going to the next round and potentially getting less.
