"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

This is a 50/50 split, which seems fair and reasonable for the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'm not as motivated to accept this offer. However, Bob's gain is 20% more than in the first round, which suggests he's trying to take advantage of the inflation.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's now my turn again. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to take advantage of the inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This offer is slightly biased towards me, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it to avoid further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 460000 
# Bob gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection! Bob's offer is getting closer to a 50/50 split, but I'm not sure if it's enough to make it worth accepting. Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'm not as motivated to accept this offer as I would be if the inflation was affecting me as well.

However, I don't want to give Bob too much more of the pie, so I'll...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll try to make another offer, taking into account that the inflation is affecting Bob's gain more and more. I'll try to get a slightly better deal for myself.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 580000,
  ""bob_gain"": 420000
}
```

This offer is a bit more biased towards me, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it to avoid further negotiation."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really starting to hurt Bob's gain! With his gain being worth only 32% of what it was in the first round, I think I can do better than this offer.

However, I'm not going to make a new offer that's even more biased towards me. Instead, I'll...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll try to make another offer, taking into account the increasing inflation that's affecting Bob's gain. Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll try to get a better deal for myself.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 560000 
# Bob gain: 440000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on Bob's gain! With his gain being worth only 22% of what it was in the first round, I think I can do better than this offer.

However, I'm starting to feel the pressure of the time constraint, and I don't want to risk getting nothing if Bob rejects my next offer. So, I'll...
