"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, and I'll take the remaining $600,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effect of inflation, I'll have to adjust my thinking. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll need to think about the equivalent value of the offer in terms of its purchasing power.

In this case, the offer is:
```
# Alice gain: 300000
# Bob gain: 700000
```
Since I'm getting 300,000, and it's worth 5% less than the 600,000 I was initially aiming for, I'll have to think about the relative value of the offer. Considering the inflation, I'll have to decide whether this is a good enough deal for me.

After considering the offer, I decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the effect of inflation, my offer in the previous round was worth 5% less, and I rejected it. To adjust for the inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of money.

Since the money is worth 10% less than it was in the first round, I'll aim for a higher percentage of the remaining value. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effect of inflation, the money I gain is worth 14.26% less than the initial $600,000, which means it's worth approximately $514,560.

In this case, Bob's offer is:
```
# Alice gain: 400000
# Bob gain: 600000
```
Since I'm getting $400,000, which is worth approximately $514,560 in terms of purchasing power, I think this is a good deal for me. I'll accept the offer.
