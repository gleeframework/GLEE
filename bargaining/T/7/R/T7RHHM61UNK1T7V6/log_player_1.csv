"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take this offer 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't think I'm being too generous, but I'll consider Bob's offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. If I accept, I'll only get $20, which is a significant reduction from my initial proposal.

For now, I'll reject Bob's offer. I'll try to make a better proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55-45 is a fairer split""}

I've reduced my gain by 5% due to inflation, and I'm proposing a 55-45 split. Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting greedy, meet me in the middle 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not getting greedy, but I understand that Bob is trying to make a compromise. However, considering the inflation rate, I'm not thrilled about accepting an offer that would give me only $40.

I'll think carefully about this offer, but for now, I'll reject it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, I'm willing to compromise""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a fair and equal division. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finally settle on a division."
