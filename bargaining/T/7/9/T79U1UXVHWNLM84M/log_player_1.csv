"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $4000 and keep $6000 for myself, with a message saying ""Let's be fair"". This way, I'm offering Bob a significant amount, but still keeping a bit more for myself since I'm the one making the first offer. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest option. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Although the offer seems fair at first glance, I need to consider the inflation factor. Since the money I gain is worth 10% less in this round, the $5000 I would get is actually equivalent to $4500 in the first round. Meanwhile, Bob's gain remains unaffected by inflation. I think I can try to negotiate for a better deal in the next round. Let's see what happens!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll take into account the inflation that has occurred so far. Considering that the money I gain is now worth 20% less (10% less in each of the two rounds), I need to adjust my offer accordingly. I'll offer Bob $4500 and keep $5500 for myself, with a message saying ""Considering inflation, let's adjust"". This way, I'm taking into account the reduced value of the money for me, while still offering Bob a reasonable amount. Let's see how Bob responds!
