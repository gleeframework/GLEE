Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to try to get as much of the money as possible!  I'm sure Bob won't be too upset about getting just $1, but if he rejects, I'll be ready to make a slightly more generous offer in the next round.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a much better deal than the first round, even with the inflation!  I'll take the 600,000 and run!"
