"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a relatively equal division, considering we're starting from scratch. I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer and we can wrap up the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split is more fair, considering we both have to agree to get anything. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't think Bob's offer is a good one, considering he's trying to take a larger share of the pie. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and meet you in the middle. Let's split it 50-50""}

I'm trying to be more flexible and meet Bob halfway, hoping he'll accept a more balanced split."
