"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

It's always better to see what Alice will propose next, as the value of the money will be lower for her in the next round.  I'll try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60-40 split is more fair, considering we both have to agree to get anything.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise and meet you in the middle. Let's split it 50-50 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice has moved to a 50-50 split, which is the fairest outcome.  The inflation is starting to bite, and accepting a fair split now is the best option for me."
