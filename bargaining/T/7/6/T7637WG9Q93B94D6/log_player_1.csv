"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose to take 999,999 dollars, and give Bob 1 dollar. This maximizes my gain in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
It's better to accept the offer in round 2. While I would have preferred a slightly larger share, taking 500,000 is a significant gain and avoids the risk of getting nothing in later rounds due to the increasing inflation."
