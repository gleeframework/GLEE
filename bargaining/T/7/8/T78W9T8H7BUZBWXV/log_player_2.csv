"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer seems fair on the surface, the inflation rate works heavily in my favor.  With each round, Alice loses value at twice the rate I do. It's in my best interest to wait and see if she offers a larger share, or to propose a more favorable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Your offer was generous, but considering the inflation, I think this split is more reflective of the situation.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm flipping the script in Round 2.  By offering Alice the mirror of her previous proposal, I'm highlighting the impact of inflation.  There's a chance she accepts, securing me a favorable outcome. If she rejects, I'm still in a strong negotiating position as time continues to work in my favor."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try to meet in the middle. This way, we both get a decent amount, and we avoid further inflation. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is getting desperate, and rightfully so.  While a 50/50 split sounds fair in principle,  the declining value of the money means I'm in a strong bargaining position. Each round that passes significantly eats into her potential gains, making her more likely to accept a deal favoring me. I'll hold out for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6500,
""alice_gain"": 3500,
""message"": ""Time is running out, and we both lose with each passing round. This offer is favorable for me, but it still gives you a reasonable amount.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing the pressure on Alice. By now, she realizes the significant impact inflation is having on her potential gains. My offer is a clear statement of my advantage, but the inclusion of a ""reasonable"" (though shrinking) amount for her might entice her to accept rather than risk losing even more in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise further, but we need to find a solution soon. If we keep rejecting offers, we'll both end up with nothing. 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is cracking under the pressure, but I can squeeze out a bit more. Her fear of getting nothing is my biggest advantage right now. While her offer is getting closer to acceptable, I'm betting another round or two will push her past the 4500 mark, especially as the value continues to dwindle."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6700,
""alice_gain"": 3300,
""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time.  This is my final offer - take it or leave it.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to lay down the law.  By framing this as my ""final offer,"" I'm creating a sense of urgency.  Alice knows the clock is ticking and that my share will only grow larger if she rejects this.  The offer is heavily skewed in my favor, but the rapidly diminishing value of the money makes it risky for her to decline. This is a calculated gamble designed to maximize my gains while still leaving Alice with something."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you want a larger share, Bob, but we're getting closer to the deadline.  If we don't come to an agreement soon, we'll both lose everything. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 6000 
# Alice gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly drawing a line in the sand, and it's time for me to be realistic. While I was aiming for a larger share, her final offer is still better than anything I could have gotten in the first round. The risk of getting nothing at all now outweighs the potential for a slightly larger gain. It's time to secure a win while I still can."
