"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, Bob! What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving each of us $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 80% now, you can have 20% for now, but you'll get more if we play more rounds. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's proposal. Since the money is worth less for Bob in each round, it's in my best interest to wait and see if I can get a better deal in the next round. However, Bob's offer is quite tempting, and I'm not sure if I'll get a better offer in the next round.

I'll decide to reject Bob's offer for now.

```

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 80/20 in favor of Bob, I'll try to get a better deal this time. I'll propose a 60/40 split, giving me a larger share than before.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Better deal for me this time, Bob! 60/40 split. What do you say?""

# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob is getting aggressive! With the money decreasing in value, I'm starting to feel the pressure. However, I'm not ready to give in just yet. I think I can do better than 10% this time.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is really trying to squeeze me out now! With the money decreasing in value so rapidly, I'm starting to feel the pressure. However, I'm not ready to give in yet. $50,000 is still a significant amount, but I think I can do better.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better deal.
