Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm still waiting for a better one 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation. While my potential gains are diminishing, hers remain the same. It's getting riskier, but I'm hoping she'll become more reasonable rather than risk getting nothing in the final round."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""This is my last offer. Take it or leave it.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's getting very risky now. I need to signal that I'm serious about not accepting anything less than a reasonable amount. By mirroring her initial offer, I'm hoping she'll see that continuing is pointless and that she's risking getting nothing if we reach the final round."
