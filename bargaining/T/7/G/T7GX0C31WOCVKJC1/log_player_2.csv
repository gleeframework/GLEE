""message"": ""Your offer was quite greedy, Alice. Let's be more reasonable. I think a 60/40 split is fair considering the inflation.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's compromise. I'll take a bit less, but I'm still hoping for a larger share. This is a 55/45 split, closer to your proposal, but it's the best I can offer right now. Let's end this. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
