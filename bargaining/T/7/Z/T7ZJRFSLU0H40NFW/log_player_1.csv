"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI'll start by offering a division of $60 for myself and $40 for Bob. Given the rules of the game, where each round decreases the value of the money, it's strategic to try and reach an agreement early on to maximize the value of the share for both of us. My message to Bob emphasizes fairness but also acknowledges that I'm taking a slightly larger share, hoping he'll see the benefit in accepting early to minimize loss due to inflation.\n\nYour turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a larger share, but let's find a compromise that benefits us both while the money is still valuable. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject Bob's offer because, despite the decreasing value of money due to inflation, accepting 45% in the second round doesn't seem like the best option for me. Given that the money is worth 20% less for me with each passing round, I need to aim for a higher share to compensate for the loss in value. Additionally, Bob's offer of 55% for himself is significantly higher than what I'm willing to accept at this stage, considering I started with a proposal of 60% for myself. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a more favorable division.\n\nYour turn!"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a larger share.""}\n\nIn this round, I've decided to slightly reduce my initial offer to show willingness to compromise, considering the impact of inflation on the value of the money. By offering 58% for myself and 42% for Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground that acknowledges Bob's desire for a fair share while also taking into account the higher rate of inflation affecting my potential gain. The message to Bob emphasizes the need for a larger share due to the decreasing value of the money, aiming to expedite the negotiation process.\n\nYour turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is a fair deal. Let's split it evenly before inflation eats away at our potential gains. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on the value of the money for me, with it being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, accepting Bob's offer of an even split seems like the most reasonable decision at this point. The offer is fair, as Bob suggests, and the decreasing value of the money with each passing round makes it risky to continue negotiating for a slightly higher share. By accepting the 50-50 split now, I'm securing a concrete amount that, although less than initially desired, is preferable to the potential of ending up with nothing or a significantly devalued share if negotiations were to continue. This decision prioritizes certainty over the gamble of future rounds.\n\nYour turn!"
