"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but still a good chunk for me 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about it.

I'm not sure if I want to accept an offer that gives me $4,000, which is still 40% of the original amount, but only 80% of what I would have gotten in the first round. It's a good offer, but I'm not sure if I want to give Bob a 60% share of the remaining money.

I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll think about it, but I'm not sure I'm ready to give you 60% of the remaining amount""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm still willing to be generous""
}
```

I'm proposing a new split that gives me a slightly larger share than before, but still leaves Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not getting any younger 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to get a better deal as the game goes on.

I'll think about it...

Actually, I think I'll accept this offer. I'm not getting any younger either, and I think 45% of the original amount is a reasonable share, considering the inflation and the fact that I'm not sure how much the money is worth to Bob.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
