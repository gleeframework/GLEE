"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a good start, let's split it roughly 60-40. Accept and we can seal the deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a generous share, but I'm keeping the majority of the money for myself. The message is a friendly one, trying to persuade Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think we can do better.  Let's split it 60-40, with me taking the larger share this time. It's a fair starting point, and we can both benefit from moving forward. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to turn the tables on me. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""No way, I'm not giving you the larger share. You think you can just reverse the offer and I'll accept? Think again!""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I don't want to give him the larger share, and I'm not willing to back down from my original proposal. The game is heating up!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting the better deal that easily! I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still taking the larger share. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly smaller share, but still keeping the majority of the money for myself. The message is a bit more aggressive, trying to put pressure on Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a larger share to justify moving forward.  Let's split it 55-45, with me taking the larger portion.  This offer is fair, and it allows us both to get a decent return. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to find a middle ground. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You're getting too greedy, Bob! 55-45 is not a good deal for me. I'm not going to let you take the larger share without a fight!""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I don't think 55-45 is a fair split, and I'm still trying to protect my interests. The game is getting intense!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting any closer to getting the better deal, Bob. I'm still in control here. Take it or leave it, but don't expect me to give in!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping the majority of the money for myself. The message is a bit more confrontational, trying to assert my dominance in the negotiations."
