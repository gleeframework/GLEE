"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, I get a bit more 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While it's tempting to accept a quick split, I want to see if I can get a better deal.  I'll counter in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Let's flip the script. I'll take the bigger share this time, but we can both benefit more in future rounds if we work together."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle, inflation is hitting us both 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

Alice's offer is closer to what I was aiming for in the first round, and the inflation is starting to hurt.  Accepting ensures a decent gain, even with the reduced value."
