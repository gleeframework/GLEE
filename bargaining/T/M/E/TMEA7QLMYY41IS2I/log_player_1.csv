I'm going for a hefty share, but I'm leaving Bob with a decent amount. I want to see if he's willing to accept a deal that heavily favors me in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, the value of the money is decreasing significantly.  Accepting this offer ensures I get a decent amount and avoids further inflation."
