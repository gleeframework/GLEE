Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. I'm willing to give you a larger share, but this is as far as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than her first, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  The inflation is also becoming a significant factor. If we reject and propose again in round 4, even a slightly less favorable split for us will still be more valuable in real terms than accepting this offer now. It's a gamble, but the potential reward for a few more rounds is worth the risk."
