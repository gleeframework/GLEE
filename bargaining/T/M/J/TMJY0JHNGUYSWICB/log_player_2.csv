Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see your point, but I still think I deserve a larger share. Let's compromise 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is offering a compromise, the deal is still heavily skewed in her favor, especially considering the rapid inflation for Bob. Each round that passes makes accepting an unfair deal more tempting, but it's better to hold out for a more equitable split. Bob needs to firmly demonstrate that he understands the situation and won't be lowballed."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is it. A perfectly even split.  Anything less is unacceptable given the circumstances. Let's end this and both benefit.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time for a strong stance.  Offering a 50/50 split is fair and highlights the urgency of the situation.  The message is direct, emphasizing that Bob is serious about getting a fair deal and won't settle for less. This might be the jolt needed for Alice to realize the negotiation can't drag on much longer."
