Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 80:20 is a more reasonable split, considering the initial offer was already too generous to me. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{
