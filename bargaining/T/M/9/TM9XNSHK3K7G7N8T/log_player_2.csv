Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll meet you in the middle. 56-44 is my final offer.

# Alice gain: 5600

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in round 5 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  The longer the game goes on, the less the money is worth to both of us, especially to Bob who faces a higher inflation rate.
* **Alice's Stance:**  Alice has indicated this is her final offer, suggesting she's unlikely to budge further.
* **Potential Losses:** Rejecting this offer risks even worse outcomes in future rounds where Bob's negotiating position weakens with each iteration. 

Accepting a 44% share now (even with inflation) is better than potentially getting a smaller portion later or even reaching a stalemate where both lose out."
