"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll decide whether to accept Bob's offer or not.

Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll compare the relative gains.

In the first round, I offered 600,000, and now Bob is offering 450,000, which is 25% less than my initial offer. Considering the inflation, this is a good deal for me.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
