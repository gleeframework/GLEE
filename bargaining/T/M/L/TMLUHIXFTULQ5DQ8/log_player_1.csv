"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This is my initial offer. I'm trying to secure a large portion of the money, but I'm also offering Bob a decent share to hopefully make him accept it in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is offering me significantly less than I initially offered him. I'm willing to take a risk and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly lower share than in the first round, but still a substantial amount. With each round, the money is worth less, so I need to be more assertive in securing a good share for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still not very good, and the inflation is really starting to bite. I need to push for a better deal, even if it means risking getting nothing at all."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still aiming for a significant portion of the money. I need to find a balance between securing a good share and convincing Bob to accept before the inflation eats away too much of the value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse, and the inflation is hurting me. I need to try and secure a better deal, even though the risk of getting nothing increases with every round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm sticking with a similar offer to round 3.  The inflation is hurting, but I'm still hoping to secure a good chunk of the money. It's a gamble, but I'm not convinced Bob will continue to reject a reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is getting risky, the inflation is really hitting hard. Bob's offer is not great, but it's the best I've been offered in a while.  I need to accept before the value drops even further and I risk getting nothing."
