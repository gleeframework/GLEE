Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair.  A 50/50 split seems like the most logical way to divide the money.  What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000
