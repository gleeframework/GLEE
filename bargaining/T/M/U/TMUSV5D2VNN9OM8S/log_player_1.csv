"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose a 50/50 split. It's fair and simple.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject Bob's offer. While a 40/60 split is better than nothing, I still believe I can get a better deal. Let's see what I can offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}
```

I'm offering a 45/55 split.  This is a compromise, and while it's not ideal, it's better than the 40/60 split Bob offered.  Hopefully, he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer.  Even with the inflation, I believe I can still get a better deal. It's risky, but I'm willing to gamble on getting a better outcome in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 46, ""bob_gain"": 54}
```

I'm offering a 46/54 split. While inflation has hit hard, I believe this is a fair compromise that gives Bob a slight advantage while still being a better deal for me than his previous offers. Hopefully, he'll accept."
