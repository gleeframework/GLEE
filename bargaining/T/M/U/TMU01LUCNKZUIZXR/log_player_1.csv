"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives Alice the majority of the money, but still leaves a decent amount for Bob.  It's a good starting point, but I expect Bob to counter-propose."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 190000 
# Bob gain: 810000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much worse for me than my initial offer, and the inflation is starting to hurt. I need to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm lowering my initial offer slightly to account for inflation and the fact that Bob rejected my previous offer. This still gives me a good amount of the money, but it's more reasonable and hopefully will encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 343900 
# Bob gain: 656100 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still pretty bad, and the inflation is starting to hurt both of us significantly. I need to hold out for a better deal, even though the time is running out."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still aiming for a significant portion of the money. The inflation is a serious factor now, and I need to be more realistic about the potential outcome. However, I'm still hopeful that Bob will see the value of a deal and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 468559 
# Bob gain: 531441 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but the inflation is eating away at the value of the money. I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me less than half the money at this point. I need to see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm lowering my offer one last time. We're getting close to the end, and inflation is starting to really bite. This offer gives Bob a fair share, and hopefully, he'll accept it before we both lose everything."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 521704 
# Bob gain: 478296 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money, this is a much better offer than the previous rounds, and it gives me a decent share.  It's risky to keep rejecting, as the next round will see further inflation, and there's no guarantee Bob will offer anything better.  I'll accept this offer and secure something for myself."
