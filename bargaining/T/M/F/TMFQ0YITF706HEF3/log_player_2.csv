"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. Fair is fair! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be realistic, Alice. I'm making the next offer, and the value decreases for me each round. This offer still leaves you with a good amount.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the value is decreasing for you, Bob. But I think we can still find a compromise. Let's try a 55/45 split. It's a good deal for both of us, and we can end this game before it gets too messy. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Reason: While not ideal, accepting a 45/55 split in round 3 is better than risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds. The offer gives Alice a slight advantage, but waiting any longer will only result in a worse deal for Bob.
