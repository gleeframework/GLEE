**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing a tough game, but she's clearly aware of the pressure inflation puts on me.  While her offer is only slightly better, accepting now would mean accepting significantly less than what I could have gotten in earlier rounds. I need to show her I'm willing to risk it all to get a better deal. It's a gamble, but with the inflation rate, even a 50/50 split in a later round might be better than accepting this offer now."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is it. A true 50/50 split. Take it before we both end up with nothing. This is our last chance to be fair.""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

We are now past the halfway point, and Alice is holding firm. While I want a better deal, the risk of losing everything is getting too high. Offering a 50/50 split is the strongest signal I can send that I am serious about reaching a deal before it's too late.  Alice is likely to reject this offer as well, but it sets the stage for a potentially desperate offer from her in the next round where I might be able to gain a slight advantage."
