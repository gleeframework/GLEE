I'm not going to let Bob get away with that! Let's see if he's willing to negotiate further."

I'm going to increase my share slightly from the first round, but still offer a significant portion to Bob. I hope this shows him I'm willing to be reasonable, but I'm not giving in easily."

Bob is getting greedy! I'm not going to accept such a low offer, especially with the inflation hitting me so hard. I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm still willing to compromise, but I need to start securing a larger share of the money. This offer is fair, considering the inflation, and I hope Bob sees that."
