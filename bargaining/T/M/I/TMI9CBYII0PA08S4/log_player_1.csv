I'm taking a 90/10 split in my favor, knowing inflation will hurt Bob more than me in the long run.  Let's see if he takes it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

While I would prefer a larger share, a 50/50 split is still a good outcome considering the inflation factor. Accepting this offer ensures I get at least half the money, and any further rounds risk getting even less due to inflation."
