45.0,55.0,I think we can do better than 60/40. How about we meet closer to the middle?,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer. I'm willing to move a bit closer to the middle, how about a 55/45 split?  Time is ticking and we both lose if this drags on.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
48.0,52.0,"I see we're getting closer. I'll meet you a bit closer to your offer, but I still think I deserve a bit more than 45.",Bob,4,

50.0,50.0,"Bob, let's be realistic. We're approaching the halfway point and the value is decreasing rapidly. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both walk away with something substantial.  Don't let greed ruin our chances!",Alice,5,
