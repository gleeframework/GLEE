"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly.  I'll take 60, you take 40.  Sounds good? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I want to see if I can get a better deal, given the inflation factor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I'll take 60 and you get 40. That seems fair to me.  It's better than what you offered last time, and it keeps things moving.  What do you say?""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's just split it evenly this time.  I think we can both agree that 50/50 is the fairest way to go. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I would prefer to get more, I'm not sure how much longer Alice will be willing to play.  With the inflation, my gains are shrinking, and I don't want to risk getting nothing.  Accepting 50/50 ensures I get something."
