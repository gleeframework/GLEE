"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game early!""
}
```

This offer is quite straightforward - I'm proposing that I get the entire $100, and Bob gets nothing. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it fairly, but I'm not giving you all the power 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 95% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not thrilled with the offer, but I think I'll accept it. I'd rather have 40$ now than risk waiting for a better offer and potentially getting nothing.
