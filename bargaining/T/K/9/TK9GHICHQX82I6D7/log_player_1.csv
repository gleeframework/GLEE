"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a very lopsided offer in my favor, hoping that Bob will be tempted to accept quickly, given the inflation factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, a 50/50 split is fair and avoids the risk of getting nothing in later rounds due to inflation."
