"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40, which is 40% of the initial $100. This way, we both get a decent amount to start with, and we can negotiate further in the next rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly.  This way we both get a good start. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 9% less than the initial $100.

I'm not sure if I want to split it evenly, especially since I had a decent offer initially. However, I also don't want to reject the offer and risk getting less in the next round.

I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
