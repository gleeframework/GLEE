"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

Let's see if Bob is willing to take a small share in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
It's better to accept this offer. While I'm losing money due to inflation, 5000 is still a decent amount and there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the future."
