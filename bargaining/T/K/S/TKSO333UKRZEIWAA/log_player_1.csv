"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, I'm willing to compromise""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%. I'm trying to be reasonable and compromise, hoping Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair to start with a slight advantage for me, as I'm taking the risk of rejection. Let's see if we can find a more even split later on. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's proposal, but I'm willing to consider it. Since the money is worth 5% less for Bob, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now, hoping that we can find a more even split later on. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
