"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, it's a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with me getting $400,000 and Bob getting $600,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share this time, but it's still a fair deal. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too thrilled about the 5% decrease in value, but I'll consider Bob's offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept a 2:3 split, especially with the money being worth less. I'll try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer:

{""alice_gain"": 420000, ""bob_gain"": 580000, ""message"": ""I'll take a slightly bigger share this time, but I think this is a fair compromise""}

I'm trying to find a middle ground and offer a 42:58 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than Bob's previous offer. Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this compromise."
