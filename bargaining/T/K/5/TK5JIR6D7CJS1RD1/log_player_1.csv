"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm starting with a fair and equal split, hoping Bob will accept and we can avoid any further negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 400k, but I want 600k for myself. It's a fair deal! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer. With the 5% inflation, my gain of 400,000 is now worth 380,000 in real terms. Bob's gain of 600,000 is still 600,000 in nominal terms, but I have no idea how much it's worth to him due to the unknown inflation rate.

I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer or reject it and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 400,000 for me and 600,000 for himself, I'll try to counter with a slightly higher offer for myself to increase my chances of getting a better deal.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a slightly bigger share, but I'm still willing to compromise. What do you say, Bob?""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think 650k is the maximum I can accept. Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is taking a toll on my potential gain! With the 14.26% inflation, my gain of 350,000 is now worth around 300,000 in real terms.

Bob's offer is a bit better than his previous one, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer or try to negotiate further.

However, considering the decreasing value of money due to inflation, I think I should try to get a better deal. I'll reject this offer and see if I can get a better proposal from Bob.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to take advantage of Bob's previous offers to make a stronger proposal. Since he's been offering me 350,000 in the last round, I'll try to get a bit more this time.

Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Can we make a deal, Bob?""
}
```"
