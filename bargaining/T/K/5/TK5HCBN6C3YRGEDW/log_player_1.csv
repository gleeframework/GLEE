Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your turn Alice. I propose a fair 50/50 split. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3

""alice_gain"": 5150,
""bob_gain"": 4850,
""message"": ""The clock is ticking, Bob.  I'm coming down a bit, let's make a deal.""

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle. This is a reasonable offer. 
# Alice gain: 5050 
# Bob gain: 4950 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is getting closer to a split that might be acceptable, I'm aiming to get a bit over half the money due to the inflation working against me. I'm willing to play hardball a bit longer to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5100,
""bob_gain"": 4900,
""message"": ""This is a good deal, Bob. I'm dropping it by $50. Let's close this out and both benefit.""

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it's clear we both want a deal.  Let's be fair and split this evenly. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  While I'd prefer a slightly better split, Bob is unlikely to go higher than this. The longer this goes on, the less his offers are worth to me anyway. A 50/50 split is better than risking getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
