"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a fair proposal. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider the new offer. Since the money is worth 20% less for me, I'm effectively gaining 40 * 0.8 = 32 dollars, while Bob is gaining 60 dollars. This is a better deal for me, but I'm not sure if I should settle for it. I'll reject it for now.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a new proposal. Considering the inflation, the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, so I'll aim for a higher percentage of the remaining amount. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}"
