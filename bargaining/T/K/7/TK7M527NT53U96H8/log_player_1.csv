Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to propose a relatively fair split, keeping in mind the inflation.  I'm willing to give Bob a slightly larger share, hoping he'll accept in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is slightly better for him, it's still not worth accepting.  I'm hoping I can get a better deal in the next round when I get to propose."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

Since Bob rejected my previous offer, I'm going to propose an even split.  With the inflation, this is a slightly better deal for me than the first round.  It's also a fair offer, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
