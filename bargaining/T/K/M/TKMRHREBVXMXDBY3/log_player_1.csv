"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here!""
}
```

This offer gives me $600,000 and Bob gets $400,000. The message is a friendly opening offer, inviting Bob to consider a fair split and potentially negotiate from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started with a fair split, but I'm looking for a bit more. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: $570,000 (5% less than $600,000)
Bob gain: $665,000 (5% less than $700,000)

Considering Bob's message, it seems he's looking for a bit more, but this offer is still quite lopsided. I'll try to counter with a more balanced offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's still a bit too one-sided, let's try to find a more balanced split!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, the money is now worth 10% less than in the first round. Let's make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to keep a bit more. Let's meet in the middle?""
}
```

This offer gives me $550,000 and Bob gets $450,000, which is a slightly more balanced split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I think I can do better than that. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is now worth 14.26% less than in the first round. Let's calculate the actual amounts:

Alice gain: $430,000 (14.26% less than $500,000)
Bob gain: $545,000 (14.26% less than $635,000)

Considering Bob's message, it seems he's still looking to get a bit more. However, this offer is actually quite similar to my previous one, and I'm not sure if I'm willing to give up more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure if I'm willing to give up more, let's see what you're willing to do next!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, the money is now worth 19.51% less than in the first round. Let's make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet exactly in the middle, I'm willing to compromise and give you an equal share!""
}
```

This offer gives me $500,000 and Bob gets $500,000, a perfectly balanced split."
