"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, then we can reassess if needed.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not willing to give up too much 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 5% less, I'm in a slightly better position than before. However, Bob's offer is still a decent one.

I'll accept this offer.

```
