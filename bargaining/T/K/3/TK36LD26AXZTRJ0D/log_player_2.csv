It's better to reject this offer. While 10 dollars is something, I can try to get a better deal with more rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 90, ""alice_gain"": 10}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 20 
# Alice gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even with the inflation, 20 dollars is better than nothing and the chances of getting a better deal are slim."
