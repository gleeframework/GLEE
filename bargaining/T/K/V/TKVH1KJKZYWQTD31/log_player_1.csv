## Thoughts behind the decision:

Bob is playing chicken, hoping you will crack under the pressure of inflation.  While this offer is better than nothing, there's still a chance to get more. He's consistently mirroring your offers but lagging behind, suggesting he'll fold soon.

}
```

## Thoughts behind the decision:

* **Urgency:**  This is the second to last round. It's crucial to convey the urgency of the situation to Bob.
* **Appearing to Concede:** By dropping the offer significantly, we're creating the impression of a final concession.  This might be enough to push Bob into accepting. 
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:**  While it's a risk to drop this low, the potential loss of getting nothing in the final round is a powerful motivator for Bob to accept."
