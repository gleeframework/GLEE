"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
I'm Bob, and this offer is ridiculously unfair!  Let's see if we can negotiate something better."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose a much fairer split. I'll take 900,000 and Alice can have 100,000. This ensures a significant share for me, but also gives Alice a decent starting point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50000 
# Alice gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice's offer is still unfair. While I understand that the game has shifted and we both have to work together, taking such a small portion is unacceptable. I will continue to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 800000, ""alice_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a good share of the money. I'm offering 800,000 for myself and 200,000 for Alice. Let's see if we can reach an agreement this round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice's offer is still not good enough, considering the inflation. Even though I am losing a lot of value, I'm not going to accept such a small share. I'll try to negotiate again."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm offering 700,000 for myself and 300,000 for Alice. It's time to be more realistic with the inflation, but I still need to secure a substantial portion to make this worthwhile."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

While Alice's offer is getting closer to a more balanced split, it still doesn't account for the significant inflation I've experienced. I need a larger share to make this worthwhile."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering 600,000 for myself and 400,000 for Alice.  We're both losing value due to inflation, but this is the fairest split considering the circumstances.  Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

With the significant inflation I've experienced, accepting this offer is the best option. While it's not ideal, it ensures I get at least something.  It's better than walking away with nothing."
