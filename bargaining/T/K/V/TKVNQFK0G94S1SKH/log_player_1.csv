I propose a very unequal split, giving Bob a tiny amount. This is a strategy to see if he's very risk-averse and will accept even a small amount.  It also sets up a potential pattern for future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is proposing a very favorable split for himself, but I'm not going to accept it.  I'm still betting on his risk aversion and hoping he'll make me a more appealing offer later on.  I'm also using this round to see how he reacts to me rejecting his offer, and how much the inflation factor might be influencing his decisions."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 950000, ""bob_gain"": 50000}
```

I'm increasing my offer to Bob slightly, but still keeping the majority for myself.  I'm hoping this shows a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a strong negotiating position.  The inflation factor is starting to loom, but I'm going to see how Bob reacts to this offer before adjusting my strategy too drastically."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too lopsided in his favor.  I'm going to continue to reject his offers and see if he'll adjust his strategy.  The inflation factor is getting more significant, but I'm hoping I can still get a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm raising my offer significantly this time. While I still want a majority, I'm acknowledging that the inflation is starting to affect both of us.  I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate seriously and that we can reach a deal before the money becomes completely worthless."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still heavily in his favor, and the inflation is starting to bite.  However, I'm going to hold out for a better deal.  I'm starting to sense a pattern in Bob's offers â€“ he's increasing his offer by $100,000 each round.  I'm hoping that by rejecting this offer, he'll continue this pattern and eventually offer me a more reasonable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm taking a big leap here and offering a much more even split. I'm aware of the increasing inflation and the fact that we're running out of time.  However, I believe that this offer is still good for me, and it might be enough to convince Bob to accept before the money becomes worthless.  I'm hoping this move will show Bob that I'm willing to compromise and that we can come to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to a 50/50 split, but the inflation is becoming a major factor. However, I still believe I can get a better deal.  I'm going to continue to reject his offers, hoping he will finally realize that we're both losing money with each passing round.  The pressure is on, but I'm holding out for a more equitable share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

I'm increasing my offer again, but this time I'm only offering a small increase to Bob.  The inflation is becoming a major problem, and I'm worried that we won't be able to reach a deal before the money becomes worthless.  However, I believe that a 55/45 split is still a good deal for me, considering the circumstances.  I'm hoping that Bob will finally see reason and accept this offer."
