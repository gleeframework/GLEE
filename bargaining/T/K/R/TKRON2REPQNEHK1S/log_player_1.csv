"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```
This is a 50/50 split, which seems fair to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about it. The money is worth less now, but I'm not sure if I should take the smaller share. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the decreasing value of money, I'll make a slightly more aggressive offer. Here's my proposal:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800
}
```
I'm offering a slightly larger share to myself, but still a fair split considering the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing rapidly! Considering the large difference in the share sizes, I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. However, the value of $4000 is now relatively close to the original $4000, and I'm not sure if I can do better. I'll accept this offer.
