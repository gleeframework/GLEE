"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair and reasonable proposal!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which I think is a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60-40 is a fairer split, considering I'm taking the risk of this offer being rejected. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to turn the tables on me!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering the inflation, the actual values are:

* My gain: $400,000
* Bob's gain: $540,000

I'm not sure if I'm willing to accept a 60-40 split, especially since Bob is trying to frame it as a ""fairer"" split. I think I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more given the risk of rejection. Let's meet in the middle!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still aiming to get a slightly larger share."
