"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself. This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it to get some money upfront."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 95% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 80% of what it was in the first round.

My initial offer was 700,000, which is now worth 665,000 (95% of 700,000). Bob's offer is 600,000, which is worth 320,000 (80% of 400,000).

I'll reject this offer, as I'm hoping to get a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 90.25% of what it was in the first round (95% of 95% = 90.25%). I'll aim to get a bit more than my initial offer.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 680000,
  ""bob_gain"": 320000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation:

My initial offer was 700,000, and now it's worth 70.75% of that (1 - 0.1426 = 0.8574, then 0.8574 * 700,000 = 602,580). Bob's offer is 580,000, which is worth 64.8% of 700,000 (1 - 0.3482 = 0.6518, then 0.6518 * 700,000 = 456,260).

I'll accept this offer, as it's better than my previous offer and the inflation has reduced the value of the money.
