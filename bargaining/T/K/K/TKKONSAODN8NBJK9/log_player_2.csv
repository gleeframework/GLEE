"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the $10000 with a 75/25 split in favor of Alice. This ensures a fair distribution considering the potential loss due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While a 25% share is not terrible, it's worth risking a round to see if Alice will offer a better deal in the next round, especially considering the inflation factor."
