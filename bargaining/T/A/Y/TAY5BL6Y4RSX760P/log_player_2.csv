**Reasoning:**  While this offer is closer to a more reasonable split, Alice is still benefiting significantly more from the delays thanks to the inflation disparity. We're running out of time, but another rejection might push her to make a much better offer in the next round."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical outcome here."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Six rounds in, and Alice is clearly feeling the pressure but still holding out for a slight advantage.  Offering a 50/50 split is the most strategically sound option at this stage. It: 

*  **Highlights fairness:** It directly addresses her previous ""compromise"" offer by proposing a genuinely even split.
* **Emphasizes urgency:** The message reinforces the time constraint, making further stalling less appealing. 
* **Preserves our position:** Even with the inflation working against us, a 50/50 split at this stage is far superior to risking a failed negotiation and getting nothing."
