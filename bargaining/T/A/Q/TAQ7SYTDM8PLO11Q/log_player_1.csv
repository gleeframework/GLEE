"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount, and I get a slight edge since I'm the first to propose."

# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll have to be careful.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the 55/45 split. I'd like to propose a slightly better deal for myself.""
}
```"

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
