"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a chance to accept!""
}
```

This way, I'll get 80% of the original $100, and Bob will get 20%. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm still trying to conserve some for myself 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 5% less, so I'd actually get $70 * 0.95 = $66.5, and Bob's gain is worth 10% less, so he'd get $30 * 0.9 = $27.

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but it's a bit better than the previous one. I'll decide to reject it and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, my gain is worth 5% less than in the previous round, so I'll aim for a slightly higher percentage this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still want a fair share!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I still think I deserve a bigger share 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 14.26% less than the original, so I'd get $60 * 0.855 = $51.3, and Bob's gain is worth 27.1% less, so he'd get $40 * 0.7273 = $29.09.

I'm not sure if this is the best I can get, but I'm willing to accept this offer to end the game. It's not the highest percentage I've proposed, but it's a decent compromise.
