"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $40 and taking $60 for myself, with a message that suggests this is a fair division. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn to propose a fairer deal. Think carefully, the clock is ticking! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer. Although the money is worth 20% less now, I believe I can get a better deal in the next round. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Come on, let's split the difference!""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $42 and taking $58 for myself. Since the money is worth 20% less now, this offer is actually more generous than my initial one. I'm hoping Bob will see it as a good compromise and accept it. Fingers crossed!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out! Let's end this with a fair and equal split. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI'm accepting Bob's offer. With the money being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I think it's time to cut our losses and end the game. A 50/50 split seems fair at this point, and I don't want to risk losing even more value to inflation. Let's shake on it and call it a day!"
