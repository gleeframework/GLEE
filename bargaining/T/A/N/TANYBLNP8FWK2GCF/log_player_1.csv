"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money 3:1, a fair start to the game""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $250,000, which is a relatively small amount, hoping that he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's start with a 50/50 split, a fair and equal start 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $500,000 is now worth $400,000.

I'm not thrilled with the 50/50 split, but I'll consider it. Since the game is still in its early stages, I'll try to negotiate further. I'll reject this offer to see if I can get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my gain of $400,000 is now worth $320,000.

I'll make a new offer, trying to take a slightly larger share:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""You started with a 50/50, now I'll offer 60/40, a slight adjustment""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll try to adjust to your 60/40, but I'll offer 55/45, a slight counter-adjustment 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $320,000 is now worth $166,400.

I'm not thrilled with the 55/45 split, but it's getting closer to my initial 60/40 offer. I'll accept this offer to avoid further negotiations and take the $400,000.
