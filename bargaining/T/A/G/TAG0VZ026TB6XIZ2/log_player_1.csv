Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60}

I'm offering a slightly more favorable split for Bob, but I'm also starting to feel the pressure of inflation.  I hope this will be enough to convince him to accept, but I'm also prepared for the possibility that we'll both end up with nothing if we keep going."

Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 35, ""bob_gain"": 65}
```

This is a difficult choice, but I'm going to offer Bob a slightly larger share than I would have liked. We're getting close to the end of the game, and I need to accept that inflation is hitting me hard. I'm still hoping for some compromise, but I'm also willing to take a slightly smaller share to avoid getting nothing at all."

# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. Even though I'm losing a significant amount of money due to inflation, I can't accept such a lopsided deal. Bob is being incredibly greedy and doesn't seem to care about the consequences of potentially getting nothing in the end.  I'm willing to risk it all and hope that he'll come to his senses in the next round, or at least realize that he's losing out on a lot of money by being so uncompromising."
