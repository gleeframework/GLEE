"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm offering a 50/50 split, which is a fair and equal division of the $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is affecting me, I see!

After considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll try to make a better offer now that the stakes are lower due to inflation. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}

I'm offering a slightly higher amount to myself to make up for the lost value due to inflation."
