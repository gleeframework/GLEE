"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

This way, I'll get 70% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob will get 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $500,000 is now worth 95% of what it was in the first round, which is $475,000. I'll consider this offer.
