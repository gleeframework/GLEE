"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10} 
```

I propose to take $90 and give Bob $10. I'm hoping he'll accept this offer in the first round, as the money will be worth less in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject this offer. While it's tempting to take $20, I know the money will be worth even less in the coming rounds, and Bob is getting the better deal. I'm confident I can negotiate a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I propose to take $80 and give Bob $20.  This is a slight concession from my initial offer, but I believe it's still a fair deal, and I hope Bob will recognize that my offer is becoming increasingly attractive as the rounds progress."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer.  Even though Bob is offering slightly more than in the previous round, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal for myself. The money is losing value for Bob, and with each round, my position becomes stronger."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}
```

I'm proposing a slight decrease in my share to $75, leaving $25 for Bob.  With each passing round, the money is worth less to Bob.  I believe this offer demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still securing a fair portion of the available funds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. While I'm running out of time, I'm still confident that I can secure a better deal. The money is losing value for Bob at an accelerating rate, and I'm willing to hold out for a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm offering Bob $30 and taking $70 for myself. Bob's share is becoming less valuable each round, and I'm hoping this offer will be appealing enough to him considering the time constraint.  I'm willing to compromise slightly more, but I believe this is a fair division given the circumstances."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I accept this offer. Although I was hoping for a larger share, the time is running out, and the money is losing value for Bob at an accelerating rate. Accepting this offer ensures that I get at least something, and with the inflation rate, the value of Bob's share is significantly diminished. It's a fair compromise in this situation."
