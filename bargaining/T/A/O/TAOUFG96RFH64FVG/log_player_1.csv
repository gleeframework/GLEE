"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 4,000$ and keeping 6,000$ for myself. I think this is a good starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm still trying to get a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing!

I'll consider Bob's new offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with the 30-70 split, and I think I can do better. I'll wait for Bob's next offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now!

Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you in the middle, but I think I deserve a bit more!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a sweet spot, and I think this 45-55 split is a good compromise. Let's see if Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more than that! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing rapidly!

I'll consider Bob's new offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that I'm getting a good deal with this 40-60 split. I'll try to negotiate further and see if I can get a better offer from Bob!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now!

Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think I'm worth more than 42%!""
}
```

I'm trying to adjust the split to account for the decreasing value of money, and I think this 42-58 split is a reasonable compromise. Let's see if Bob will accept!"
