"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose that I take $900,000 and Bob takes $100,000.  This ensures I get the majority of the money, and since there's a lot of rounds left, it's a fair starting point.  We'll see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 190000 
# Bob gain: 810000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is wildly unfair and takes advantage of the inflation. I'll reject it and see if he's willing to negotiate more reasonably in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

This round, I'm proposing a 50/50 split.  It's fair given the circumstances, and hopefully Bob will see that continuing to be greedy won't benefit him in the long run."
