Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm sure we can find a more equitable split. How about we reverse the roles from the last round? 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer seems fairer at first glance, inflation is working against me. Accepting this offer means I'd be getting 450,000, which is worth 10% less than its value in the previous round.  I need to aim for a better split to compensate for the inflation effect."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 520000,
""bob_gain"": 480000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic.  I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle, but I need to consider the time value of money. This is my final offer.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Bob rejected my initial 55/45 split, showing a desire for a more ""even"" share. Offering 52/48 is a significant move towards his position.
* **Deadline Pressure:** By stating it's my final offer, I introduce a sense of urgency. Bob knows time is literally money for me due to inflation. 
* **Justification:** I'm not just demanding more money; I'm framing it as a matter of ""realistic"" accounting for the situation's constraints. This makes my position stronger."
