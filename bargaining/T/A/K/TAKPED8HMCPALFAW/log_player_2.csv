"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money fairly, Bob. I think this is a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Okay Alice, let's make this simple: a straight 50/50 split.  No need to complicate things.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate the 50/50 offer, but we need to factor in the inflation. This is just slightly better for me than your offer last round. 
# Bob gain: 4900 
# Alice gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5100, ""alice_gain"": 4900, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand about the inflation, but I need a little bit more to agree. This is just slightly better for me than your offer last round.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems like we're getting close. This is right in between our last two offers. Let's settle this before inflation eats away at the value any further. 
# Bob gain: 4950 
# Alice gain: 5050 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```
 
At this point, accepting the offer is the most logical choice for a few reasons:

* **Diminishing Returns:** The longer the game continues, the less money there is to gain for both players. Inflation is rapidly eating away at the value.
* **Fairness:** Alice's offer is very close to the middle ground and represents a fair compromise. Holding out for a significantly better deal is risky.
* **Time Pressure:**  With only 7 rounds left, the pressure is on. If Bob rejects this offer, there's no guarantee he can secure a better deal in the remaining rounds. 

It's better to secure a reasonably fair deal now than risk ending up with nothing.
