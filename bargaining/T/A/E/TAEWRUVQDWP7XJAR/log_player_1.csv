I'll start by offering you 900,000$ and keeping 100,000$ for myself. This seems like a fair starting point, as it leaves you with the majority of the money. 

Let me know if you accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm going to offer Bob 550,000 and keep 450,000 for myself.  I think this is a fair compromise after the last round.  Let's see if he agrees."
