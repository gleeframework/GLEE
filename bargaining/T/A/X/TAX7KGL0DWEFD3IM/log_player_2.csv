{""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire for more, but the inflation is hitting me harder. Let's meet in the middle with a 55/45 split in my favor. This is a reasonable offer considering the decreasing value of our gains. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While not ideal, accepting a 45/55 split is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:**  The longer the game continues, the less the money is worth, especially for Alice. Her potential gains decrease at double the rate of mine. This makes her increasingly motivated to strike a deal.
* **Future Uncertainty:**  There's no guarantee Alice will offer a better deal in subsequent rounds. She might become more insistent on maintaining a larger share, especially if she senses my desperation as the value diminishes. 
* **Current Offer vs. Future Risk:** Accepting 45% now provides a guaranteed, albeit slightly smaller, return than gambling on an uncertain future. Holding out for a slightly better split isn't worth the risk of the money losing significant value."
