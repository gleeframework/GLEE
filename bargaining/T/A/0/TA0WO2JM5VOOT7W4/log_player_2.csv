Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll try to get a better deal this time. Given the initial offer was 50/50, I'll try to get a bit more. Since the money is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll aim for a 60/40 split.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the inflation continuing to erode the value of the money, I'll aim for an even more skewed split. I'll try to get 60.5% of the remaining value, which should give me a decent amount considering the decreasing value of the money.
