"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. This should be a good starting point, as it shows a willingness to negotiate while securing a significant portion of the money. I'll keep an eye on inflation and adjust my offers accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This offer is terrible, even with the inflation considered. I'm still holding out for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
``` 

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but still keeping a good chunk of the money.  I'm hoping this is a more attractive offer for Bob, especially considering the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

This offer is still too lopsided in Bob's favor. The inflation is starting to bite, but I'm not willing to give away so much of my share just yet. I'll keep fighting for a fairer split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still aiming for a significant share of the money. The inflation is getting more serious, but I'm not willing to accept an offer that's so far out of balance."
