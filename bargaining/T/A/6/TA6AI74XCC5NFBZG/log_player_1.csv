"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm leaving the door open for Bob to make a counteroffer if he'd like."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 20, you can try to do better next round 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is decreasing!

I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 20% less this round, the actual values are:

* Alice gain: 20 / 0.8 = 25
* Bob gain: 80 / 0.8 = 100

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, as it seems like Bob is getting a bit too much. I'll reject this offer and try to do better next round.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 30,
  ""bob_gain"": 70,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but still trying to keep some value for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not giving up much, I'll take a bit more 
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly!

Let's calculate the actual values for Round 4:

* Alice gain: 15 / 0.5208 (48.8% less than the original) = 28.85 (round to 29)
* Bob gain: 85 / 0.5208 = 163.29 (round to 163)

I'm not happy with this offer, as Bob is getting an even larger share than before. I'll reject this offer and try to do better next round.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

Round 5

}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a decent share and keeping some value for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not budging, I'll take what I can get now 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly!

Let's calculate the actual values for Round 6:

* Alice gain: 10 / 0.3237 (67.23% less than the original) = 30.92 (round to 31)
* Bob gain: 90 / 0.3237 = 278.15 (round to 278)

I'm not happy with this offer, as Bob is getting a huge share and I'm barely getting anything. I'll reject this offer and try to do better next round.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

* Bob gain: 95 / 0.208 = 456.73 (round to 457)

I'm not happy with this offer, as Bob is getting an extremely large share and I'm barely getting anything. I'll reject this offer and try to do better next round.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 86.58% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking the lion's share, it's now or never 
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly!

I'm not happy with this offer, as Bob is getting an enormous share and I'm barely getting anything. I'll reject this offer and try to do better next round.

However, I'm starting to get worried that I might not be able to get a better deal. I'll have to think carefully about my next move.

Round 12

# Alice gain: 0.1 
# Bob gain: 99.9 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly!

Let's calculate the actual values for Round 12:

* Alice gain: 0.1 / 0.0846 (91.41% less than the original) = 1.18 (round to 1)
* Bob gain: 99.9 / 0.0846 = 1178.53 (round to 1179)

I'm not happy with this offer, but I'm also running out of options. I'll reject this offer, but I'm not sure what will happen next.

However, I realize that I have no more rounds left, and if I reject this offer, we'll both get nothing. I'll accept this offer, even though it's not ideal.
