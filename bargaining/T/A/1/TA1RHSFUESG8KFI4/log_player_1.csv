"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, giving me a slightly larger share of the initial $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 40 is actually worth 36 in the first round's money. But since the offer is for Round 2, I'll consider the value in Round 2's money.

I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 2.
