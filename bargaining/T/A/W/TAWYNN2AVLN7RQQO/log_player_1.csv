Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the fair start, Alice, but I think we can both do better. I propose a 65/35 split in my favor, as I'm taking on the risk of this round's inflation.  Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to compromise further and offer a 57.5/42.5 split.  This reflects the growing inflation risk, but still keeps things relatively fair.  Let's make a deal before the value of the money dwindles too much.

# Bob gain: 5750
