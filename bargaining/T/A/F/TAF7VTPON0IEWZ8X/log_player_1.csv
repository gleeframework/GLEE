I propose to take 900,000 dollars and let Bob have 100,000 dollars. This seems like a fair starting point, as it's a significant share for me but still leaves Bob with a decent amount."

I'm going to lower my share a bit, but still offer a substantial amount.  This should make the deal more attractive for Bob, while still giving me a good portion of the money.  It's important to keep in mind that the money is losing value, and we need to reach an agreement soon!"
