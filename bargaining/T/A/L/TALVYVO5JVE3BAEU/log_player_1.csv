"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking a bigger share to account for the inflation. This way, we both get a decent amount, and I'm not losing too much value in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 750000 
# Bob gain: 250000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
