"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, let's see what you say""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the money, and I'll take 60%. This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, given that we both have an equal chance of making the next proposal. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 5% less, so I'll have to be more careful with my decisions.

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a bit more favorable to him than my initial offer, but it's still a reasonable split. I'll decide to...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll have to be more aggressive with my offer. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, no more games""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and equal division of the money. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game."
