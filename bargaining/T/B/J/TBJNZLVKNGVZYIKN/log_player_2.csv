Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time.  Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest solution given the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The value of my potential gain is rapidly decreasing. Waiting longer means significantly less money, even if I get a slightly better split in a later round.
* **Time Pressure:** We only have a few rounds left. If we don't reach an agreement, we both get nothing. 
* **Fairness:** Alice's offer is objectively fair. Holding out for a significantly better deal at this point is unlikely and very risky."
