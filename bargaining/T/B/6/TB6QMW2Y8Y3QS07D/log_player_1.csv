Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, but inflation is a real concern. Let's make this quick. 
# Alice gain: 4400 
# Bob gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is a fair offer considering the circumstances.  We're losing money every round! 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 
 
While Bob is right about the inflation, his offer is still skewed in his favor.  We're aiming for a better split than this."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""How about we switch it up, Bob? This deal accounts for the inflation."" 
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time!  A 50/50 split is the only fair option at this point. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
```

While we were pushing for a slight advantage, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is the safest option.  Bob is feeling the pressure of inflation, and continuing to push for more could make him act irrationally and lose us both the money."
