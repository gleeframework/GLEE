Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting impatient, last chance before I drop lower 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting impatient, but she's also getting hurt more by the inflation than I am.  Her offers are getting worse, and if I hold out, I'm likely to get a better deal in the next round or two."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 510000,
""alice_gain"": 490000,
""message"": ""Okay, Alice, I'm feeling generous.  Let's close this out - 510k for me, 490k for you.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  Alice's message suggests she might start making less favorable offers.  It's time to nudge her towards a close.
* **Slight Advantage:** This offer is still tilted in my favor, but it's a small enough difference that it might be tempting for Alice to accept rather than risk further losses to inflation. 
* **Appearing Reasonable:**  The message frames the offer as a concession on my part, which might make Alice more receptive."
