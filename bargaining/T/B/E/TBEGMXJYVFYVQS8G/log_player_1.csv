"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it! You'll get $100,000, I'll get $900,000. Don't be greedy, it's a good deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept it and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. We both get 500000, and we can move on. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is already taking its toll!

Considering Bob's proposal, I think it's a reasonable offer, especially since it's a 50/50 split. I'd rather not risk waiting for a better offer and potentially losing more value due to inflation.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
