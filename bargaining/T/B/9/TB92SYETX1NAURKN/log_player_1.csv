"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to try and take the majority of the money in this first round, knowing that the value of money will decrease with each round.  I'm offering Bob $100,000 hoping he will accept it as a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more money, accepting this offer is the best course of action. The inflation means each round my share will be worth less, and I'm not sure if Bob will be willing to offer me even this amount in the next round."
