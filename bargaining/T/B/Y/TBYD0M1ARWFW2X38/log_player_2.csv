Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation working against me. While my potential gains are diminishing, accepting this offer would still mean a significant loss compared to what I could have had in earlier rounds. I need to show Alice I'm serious about getting a fair deal and willing to push closer to the deadline if needed."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're bleeding value, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 410000 
# Alice gain: 590000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The game has reached a critical point. While the offer is far from ideal, with the inflation rapidly eroding my potential gains, I'm at a significant disadvantage. Accepting this offer, even though skewed in Alice's favor, is better than risking getting nothing at all if we don't reach an agreement soon."
