  ""alice_gain"": 6000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60/40 split, but I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share. This way, we can end the game early and avoid further erosion of our funds due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
