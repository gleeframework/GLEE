"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial $10,000, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's proposal is the opposite of mine, but it's still a 60-40 split. Since the money is worth 10% less for Bob, he's actually offering me a slightly better deal than I initially proposed. I'll accept this offer.
