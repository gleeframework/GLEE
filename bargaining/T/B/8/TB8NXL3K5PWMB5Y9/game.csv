,,,Bob,1,reject
40.0,60.0,I think 60/40 is a fair split. Let's get this done before the money starts to shrink.,Bob,2,

55.0,45.0,"Bob, let's be reasonable. I'm willing to compromise, but 60/40 your way isn't fair. How about we split the difference and do 55/45?",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
45.0,55.0,"Let's be reasonable. 55/45 is fair, and it avoids us losing more money to inflation.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
50.0,50.0,"Bob, it's clear we both want a larger share, but this back and forth is only hurting us both.  A 50/50 split is the fairest option, especially as the money continues to lose value.",Alice,5,
