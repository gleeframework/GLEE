"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, I'll give you a fair chance to propose next round.""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm also giving him the opportunity to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent share, but I'm not being too generous yet 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, my share is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round.

I'll have to decide whether to accept Bob's offer or reject it and try to negotiate further.

After considering the offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,

}
```"
