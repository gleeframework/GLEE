"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

I propose taking 9000$ and giving Bob 1000$. I'm hoping this is a fair enough offer to secure a deal in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I would prefer to get more money, the inflation means that if I reject this offer, I'll get even less in the next round.  Accepting is the best strategy to maximize my gains."
