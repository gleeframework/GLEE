"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself. Let's hope he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's split it fairly! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my share is now worth 5% less, so I need to be more cautious.

However, Bob's offer seems reasonable, and I'm not sure if I can do better. I'll accept his offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
