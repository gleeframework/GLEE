Let's see if Bob likes my generous offer. ðŸ˜œ"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not going to let Bob take advantage of me! I'll wait for my chance to make another offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm going to stick with a fair split, even though I'm losing value with each round.  Hopefully, Bob will realize it's in his best interest to accept this offer."
