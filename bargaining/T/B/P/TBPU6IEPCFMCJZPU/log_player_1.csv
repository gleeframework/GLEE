"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, with a message encouraging Bob to accept this as a fair division. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that. Let's split it 60/40, with me getting the larger share this time.  We can revisit fairness next round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince Bob's offer gives him the larger share and I believe I can negotiate for a better split considering the decreasing value of money, I'll reject his proposal.
{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nIt's my turn again! I'll make a new offer in the next round, aiming to find a more favorable division."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nIn this round, considering the inflation, the money is worth 10% less than in the second round and 20% less than in the first round. Given that Bob was willing to offer me 4000 in the previous round, I'll adjust my offer to ensure we both get a fair share, taking into account the decreasing value of money. I'll propose a split that slightly favors me but is closer to a 50-50 split to incentivize Bob to accept before the money loses more value.
{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet closer to the middle to benefit both.""}\n\n###\n\nI'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to Bob, given the urgency added by the inflation mechanic."
