"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle to get this over with.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."

Round 2

# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still not going to give you the majority 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

I'm not thrilled about the offer, but it's an improvement from the first round. I'll have to think carefully...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept this offer. I'd like to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not getting taken advantage of!""
}
```

I'm trying to get a better deal by offering a slightly higher amount to me, but still leaving a decent amount for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I think I'm getting the better end of the deal 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I have to consider the fact that the money is worth significantly less than it was initially. I'll have to think carefully...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept this offer. I'd like to try to get a better deal, but I'm getting a bit worried that I might end up with a very small amount of money if I don't get a good offer soon."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, my proposal will be adjusted accordingly.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3150,
  ""bob_gain"": 6850,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to be realistic about the value of the money at this point. This is my best offer.""
}
```

I'm trying to be more realistic about the value of the money and make a proposal that reflects the reduced purchasing power."
