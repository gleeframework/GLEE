"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}

I'm going for a fair but slightly advantageous split in the first round.  Since the money is worth less to Bob in the next round, I'm hoping he'll accept this to avoid losing even more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share,  Bob's offer is still reasonable, and the inflation is starting to bite. Accepting this offer is the best way to secure a decent amount of money."
