"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose to take $9,000 and leave $1,000 for Bob. This way, I secure the majority of the money while still leaving a small portion for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. While the money is worth less to me now, I believe this offer is more fair than Bob's previous proposal, and I'm willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though the money is worth significantly less to me now, I'm accepting this offer to avoid further loss.  It's better to get something than nothing."
