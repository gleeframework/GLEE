"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 40% of the money, is that fair?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the money, which is $4,000, and I'll take the remaining $6,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, it's a fair deal! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I need to reassess the offer.

In this round, the money is worth 10% less for me, so $10,000 is now equivalent to $9,000. Splitting it 50/50 would mean I get $4,500 and Bob gets $4,500.

I'll accept this offer.
