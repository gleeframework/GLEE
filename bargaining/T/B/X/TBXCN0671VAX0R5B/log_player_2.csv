"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split close to even, but I get slightly more to incentivize accepting this round and avoiding inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'll take a bit more since you didn't take the initial even split and we lost 5% value""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is getting silly. Let's just split it evenly before inflation eats away at our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n### \n\nI'll accept the offer since it's an even split and further rounds will only reduce the value of the money due to inflation."
