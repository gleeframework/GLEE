"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this fair offer and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $10,000 and Bob gets 20%. This way, we can both get a decent share of the money and avoid the risk of inflation reducing its value."
