70.0,30.0,"Let's make a deal, Bob. I take $70, you take $30. It's a good offer for you considering the money loses value quickly.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
40.0,60.0,"Alice, my turn. I understand the situation, but your offer was too low. How about a 60/40 split in my favor? It's more than fair considering the inflation.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
65.0,35.0,"Okay, Bob, let's be reasonable. I'll take $65, leaving you with $35. This is my final offer, consider the shrinking pot!",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
45.0,55.0,"Alice, you're being stubborn.  This is hurting both of us. I'm dropping my offer slightly to $55 for me, $45 for you.  Take the deal before the money shrinks further!",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
60.0,40.0,"Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but this is getting ridiculous.  $60 for me, $40 for you.  Don't let the money disappear before our eyes!",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
50.0,50.0,"Alice, this is getting us nowhere. We need to be realistic.  A 50/50 split is the fairest option. Let's end this before we both lose out.",Bob,6,
