"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This gives us both a good chunk of money. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer.  While it's a decent starting point, I want to see if I can get a better deal for myself, especially considering the inflation factor that favors me in later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think this is a fair split, considering the inflation advantage I have in future rounds. Let's end this quickly and both get a decent share.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to be flexible, but your offer was too low. This is a more balanced proposal. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
I'll accept this offer.  While I'd prefer a higher share, the inflation is starting to hurt Alice more and I don't want to risk losing even more money by continuing."
