"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. While I value a fair division, I also need to consider the decreasing value of money for me.  This offer reflects that, while still giving you a significant share. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
