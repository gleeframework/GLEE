"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is a 60-40 split, which seems fair to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced values due to inflation, my gain of 450,000 is now worth 0.95 * 0.9 = 0.855 * 450,000 = 382,250.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
