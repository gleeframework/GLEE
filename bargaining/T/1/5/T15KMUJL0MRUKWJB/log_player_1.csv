"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose to take $90 and give Bob $10. This is a very generous offer, but I want to get the most out of this deal before inflation starts eating away at my share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer. While the offer is tempting, it's important to remember the inflation. Even if I accept this, the next round I'll be getting only $16 (20% less than $20). It's better to take the risk and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm going to reduce my offer slightly to $80 for me and $20 for Bob.  While inflation is a factor, I still believe I can get a better deal if we keep negotiating.  This is still a reasonable offer, and I hope Bob will recognize that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I accept this offer.  With the significant inflation, I'm unlikely to get a better deal than this. While I would prefer more, I am willing to take the 50/50 split to secure some of the money before it's worth even less."
