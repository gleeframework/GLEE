"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Alice's offer was 70% of the total, I'll try to offer a higher percentage to Alice. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 2000, ""alice_gain"": 8000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the effective amounts I'd get in this round are:

* 4000 / 0.64 (1 - 0.36) = 6250 in ""real"" money
* 6000 / 0.81 (1 - 0.19) = 7409 in ""real"" money

I think I can do better than that. I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Inflation has taken a toll, and the money is worth even less now. Here's my new offer:

{""bob_gain"": 2500, ""alice_gain"": 7500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a bite out of the money. Let's calculate the effective amounts:

* 5000 / 0.4076 (1 - 0.5924) = 12260 in ""real"" money (but this is not possible, so it's a huge gain for me)
* 5000 / 0.6559 (1 - 0.3441) = 7625 in ""real"" money

This is a very generous offer from Alice, and I think I should accept it.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
