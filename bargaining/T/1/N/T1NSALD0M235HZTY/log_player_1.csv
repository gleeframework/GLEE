Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer. Inflation is hurting me more each round, and I don't think we can reach a better outcome for both of us. Accept this and let's move on. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

""decision"": ""accept""
}

**Reasoning:**

While this offer isn't ideal, it's important to consider the situation:

* **Inflation:**  Bob is feeling the pressure of inflation far more than I am. Every round makes his potential gains less valuable.
* **Finality:** He's stated this is his final offer.  Rejecting it means we go another round where I propose, but there's no guarantee I can get him to agree to a better deal than this. He might be very stubborn now. 
* **Certainty vs. Risk:** Accepting guarantees me $4000. Rejecting risks getting even less if Bob becomes more difficult to negotiate with in future rounds. 

It's a tough choice, but in this scenario, taking the guaranteed $4000 now is the safer and more logical option."
