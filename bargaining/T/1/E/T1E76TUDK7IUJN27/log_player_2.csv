"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take 99.9% and leave you with 0.1%.  It's a fair deal, considering I'm the one doing all the work here.  Accept it, and we both get something. Reject it, and we both get nothing. Your choice. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 999000, ""alice_gain"": 1000, ""message"": ""I'm going to take a slightly different approach to fairness. I'm offering you a small portion, but it's a start. We can work towards a more even split in the following rounds.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I'm willing to compromise.  You get 10% this time.  But next time, it's my turn to make a proposal again.  Let's see if we can find a more equitable split in the long run. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
