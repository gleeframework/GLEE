"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm going to take a slightly different approach to fairness. I'm offering you a small portion, but it's a start. We can work towards a more even split in the following rounds. 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
