This is a fair and equal starting point, giving both of us an equal share.  Let's see if Bob agrees!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I'm not going to let him get away with it!  I'll wait for my turn to propose a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

I'm offering a slightly higher share for myself, but I'm still being fair. Bob's offer was too lopsided, and I'm confident that I can get a better deal in the long run. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
