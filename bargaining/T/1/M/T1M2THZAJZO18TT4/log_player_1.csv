"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start by offering Bob a small share to try and get the game over quickly. I figure he'll likely accept, but I'm willing to negotiate if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob is taking advantage of the inflation, but I'm not going to let him get away with it. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm increasing my share a bit to see if Bob is willing to compromise.  He's likely feeling the pressure of inflation too, so maybe he'll accept a deal that's a bit fairer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Inflation is starting to hurt, and it looks like Bob is feeling the effects too. This is a fair offer, and it's better than risking getting nothing at all in the later rounds."
