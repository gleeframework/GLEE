"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, giving me a slightly larger share of the initial $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my strategy. Since Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
