Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor. This is a pretty aggressive offer, but I want to see if Bob is willing to accept it. Since the money loses 20% of its value each round, I want to get as much as possible early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer is the best option. The money is worth less now due to inflation, and the next round would likely offer even less.  It's better to secure 70% now than risk getting less later."
