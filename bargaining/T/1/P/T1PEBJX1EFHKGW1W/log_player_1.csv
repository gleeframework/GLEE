"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, and see how it goes from here.""
}
```

This is a fair and straightforward proposal, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share this time, let's see if you'll accept! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is trying to take a bigger share, eh?

I'll think about it for a moment... 

I don't want to give up 80% of the money, but I also don't want to risk going into the next round with less money. I'll have to think about the inflation rate...

I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Now it's my turn again!

Considering the inflation rate, I'll aim to take a slightly bigger share this time. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a slightly bigger share this time, but I'm still willing to compromise.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting greedy, I'll take a bigger share this time! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Ooh, Bob's getting bold!

Considering the inflation rate is now quite high, I'll think carefully about this offer... If I accept, I'll get 40 dollars, but it's worth less than 60 dollars would be in the first round.

However, if I reject and go into the next round, the inflation rate will be even higher, and I might end up with even less. I don't want to risk it.

I'll accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
