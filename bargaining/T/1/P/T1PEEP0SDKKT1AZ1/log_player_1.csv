"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very aggressive offer, hoping to secure the vast majority of the money early on.  Bob may find this incredibly unfair, but it sets the tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is a strategic move. Bob has shown a willingness to compromise, and further rounds of negotiation could result in a lower payout for me due to inflation.  Securing 500,000 is a good outcome considering the potential for things to get worse."
