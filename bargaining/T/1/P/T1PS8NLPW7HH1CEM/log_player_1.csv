"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60-40. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leaving $4,000 for Bob. The message is a friendly nudge to see if Bob is willing to accept a relatively even split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 60%, but I'm willing to negotiate if you think it's unfair. Let's work something out. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob, my gain of $4,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, and Bob's gain of $6,000 is worth 95% of its original value.

I don't think this offer is very fair, considering the value of the money is decreasing at different rates for each of us. I'd like to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll make a new offer that takes this into account. I'll try to get a bigger share of the money, considering the decreasing value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think I deserve a bigger share. Your turn!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. Inflation is hurting both of us, so we should compromise. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 27.1% less for me and 14.26% less for Bob, I'm starting to feel the pinch of inflation. However, Bob's offer seems like a reasonable compromise, considering the circumstances.
