"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is 40% of the total, and keeping $600,000 for myself, which is 60% of the total."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob. So, if Bob's offer is $300,000 for me and $700,000 for him, that's equivalent to $270,000 for me and $560,000 for him in the first round.

I'll accept Bob's offer from Round 2.
