{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I propose we split the money 60/40, with me getting the larger share. I think this is a fair starting point, given the value of the money will decrease with each round.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 7:3 is a more reasonable split, considering the value of the money will decrease with each round. I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share this round to keep the game going. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
