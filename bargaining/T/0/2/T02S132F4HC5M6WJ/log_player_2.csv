Let's see what Alice offers next. I'll try to get a better deal!"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, considering the inflation. It's still a good deal for you! 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a more even split, I'm concerned about further inflation. Accepting this offer guarantees me something, even if it's less than ideal."
