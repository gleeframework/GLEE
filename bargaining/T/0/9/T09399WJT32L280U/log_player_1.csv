"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to offer Bob $100,000 and keep $900,000 for myself.  This is a good starting point, but I'm hoping we can reach a compromise that's fair to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer is the best option. The inflation is eating away at my potential gains, and Bob's offer is at least something."
