Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the inflation puts you at a disadvantage, but 90/10 is too harsh. How about a more even split that still benefits you significantly? 
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
