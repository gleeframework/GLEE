Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This offer gives me a large share (9000$) and leaves Bob with a smaller share (1000$).  Since I'm the first to propose, I'm trying to maximize my gains.  Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a bad deal for me.  Even with inflation, getting only $1000 is a huge loss from the $9000 I was hoping for. I'll reject and see what I can get in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm still aiming for a bigger share, but I've adjusted my offer slightly to account for inflation and Bob's rejection. I'm hoping that offering him 2000 will be more appealing than the previous offer. Let's see what happens!"
