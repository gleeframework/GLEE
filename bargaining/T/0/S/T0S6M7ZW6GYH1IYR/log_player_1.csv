"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with an extremely lopsided offer. I want to maximize my take in the first round, knowing that the money will depreciate for me in the future. Since Bob has no inflation, I'm hoping he'll take the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I'd prefer more, the inflation is hitting hard. This is a fair split, and it's better to take it now than risk getting nothing in later rounds."
