Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle. This way we both get a fair share, even with the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###  I think accepting this offer is the best decision, considering the increasing impact of inflation on both of our potential gains. Meeting in the middle at this point ensures we both walk away with a fair share, given the circumstances. Further rounds would only continue to devalue the money, potentially leading to a worse outcome for both of us."
