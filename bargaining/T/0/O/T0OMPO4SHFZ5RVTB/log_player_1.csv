Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise. This way we both get a decent share, and I'm not too hurt by the 5% inflation each round. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
