"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm Bob, and I'm not going to accept being given only $1!  Let's see what Alice offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 90, ""alice_gain"": 10}
```

I'm going for a more balanced approach.  I'm offering Alice $10, which is a significant improvement from her previous offer, while still giving myself the majority share.  Hopefully, this will be enough to convince her to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice is still trying to take advantage of the inflation, but her offer is still significantly lower than mine in the previous round.  I'll continue to hold out for a fairer deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 75, ""alice_gain"": 25}
```

I'm going to adjust my offer again. I'm willing to go down to $75 to secure the deal. While I'm still losing out on some value due to inflation, it's a much more reasonable share compared to the previous offers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 15 
# Alice gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice is still trying to take advantage of inflation. Her offer is still lower than my last offer and I'm not willing to accept that. I'll try to make a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}
```

This is my final attempt to reach an agreement with Alice. I'm lowering my share to $60, which is a substantial concession, but I'm still getting the majority share.  It's time to see if she's willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 20 
# Alice gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still not acceptable. While it's better than previous offers, it's still not a fair division considering how much the inflation is impacting me. I'll continue to negotiate for a more reasonable deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}
```

We're getting close to the end, and it's clear we need to come to a compromise. I'm offering an even split now.  This is the fairest outcome given the significant inflation impact I'm facing. Let's see if Alice will accept."
