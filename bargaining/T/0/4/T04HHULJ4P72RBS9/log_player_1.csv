"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept it and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we should split the money more evenly. Let's start with 90/10, and we can adjust from there. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

I don't think 90/10 is a very even split, especially considering I'm the one who's losing value with each passing round. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is really starting to take a toll on me now. I need to think carefully about my next move.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bigger share to account for the inflation.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share, but I'm hoping he'll accept it and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I need to get a good amount as well to make it worth it. Let's try 70/30. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really eating away at my potential earnings!

While 70/30 is a better split than 90/10, I'm not sure if it's enough to justify accepting the offer. I'd like to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The value of the money is dwindling rapidly due to inflation. I need to think strategically about my next move.

Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I need to ensure I get a substantial amount to account for the remaining rounds.""
}
```

I'm trying to strike a balance between getting a decent share now and leaving room for future negotiations."
