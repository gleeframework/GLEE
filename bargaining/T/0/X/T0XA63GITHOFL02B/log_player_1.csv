"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take a slightly smaller share to start.""}

I'm proposing a 60:40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's start with a more aggressive split, but still fair 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not convinced by Bob's aggressive split. I'd like to make a counteroffer to try to get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with such an uneven split. I'll propose a 55:45 split instead.""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55:45 is a fairer split. It's a small adjustment, but it's worth it for a better deal.""}

I'm sticking to my original idea of a 55:45 split, but with a slightly more generous offer for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share given the inflation 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'm willing to consider it. I'm getting a bit desperate, and the inflation is making my share worth less and less.

{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""I'm not happy about it, but I'll accept your offer. It's not ideal, but it's better than going to zero.""}"
