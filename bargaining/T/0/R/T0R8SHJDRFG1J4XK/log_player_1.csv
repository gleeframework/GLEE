"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose to take 900,000$ and give Bob 100,000$. I believe this is a fair starting point, as I am taking a larger share due to the faster inflation rate on my side."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm proposing to take 800,000$ and give Bob 200,000$.  This is a compromise, as I'm reducing my share from the first round, but it still reflects the significant impact of inflation on my side."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While this offer is significantly less than what I was hoping for initially, the inflation is rapidly devaluing the money, and accepting this offer ensures I get *something*.  It's better than risking getting nothing at all in later rounds."
