"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can negotiate further if you'd like""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $9,000 and Bob gets $1,000, which is a 90-10 split. This is a relatively fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will be willing to accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted a fair split, I'll give you a bit more, but I think I deserve more for starting the negotiation 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to negotiate a better deal for himself.

I'll think about it... Considering the inflation, the actual values are:

Alice gain: $4,000 / 0.95 = $4,210.53
Bob gain: $6,000 / 0.95 = $6,315.79

I'm not thrilled about the 60-40 split, but I'm willing to consider it. I'll accept this offer for now.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
