This is a tough situation. Ideally, I would have liked to secure a larger share. However, I need to be realistic. 

* **Continuing is disastrous:** If I reject this offer, the value of my share will plummet further in the next round. I'm already losing a significant portion to inflation. 
* **Something is better than nothing:** Accepting this offer, however unfavorable, ensures I at least get something out of the game. 

Bob is clearly exploiting the inflation mechanic and my diminishing returns. It's frustrating, but accepting is the least damaging option at this point."
