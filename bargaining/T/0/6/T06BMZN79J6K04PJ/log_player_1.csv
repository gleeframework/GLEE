Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced values due to inflation, my gain of $5,000 is now worth $4,500, and Bob's gain of $5,000 is now worth $4,000.

I'll accept this offer.
