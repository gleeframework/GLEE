I'm going for a big chunk of the money, hoping Bob will be willing to accept a smaller share to get something right away.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is trying to turn the tables on me! I'm not going to accept that offer. It's still early in the game and I'm holding out for a better deal.  I know the value of the money is decreasing each round, but I'm confident I can still get a good share if I play strategically."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to try a compromise here. I'm reducing my share, but I'm still aiming for a majority. Inflation is starting to bite, but I think Bob will be tempted by a larger share than his last offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is persistent, but I'm not giving in yet.  He's offering me a very small share, and the value of the money is dropping rapidly.  I'm going to hold out for a better deal. I'm still confident I can negotiate a much larger share for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to try one more time with a majority share. Inflation is really starting to hurt now, but I believe I can still get a reasonable deal if I'm willing to compromise slightly.  I'm hoping Bob sees this as a fair offer after all the back and forth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still being stubborn.  He's increasing his share, but I'm not going to settle for a minority share, especially with the value of the money dropping so rapidly.  I'm going to keep trying to negotiate a more even split. I'm confident I can find a way to secure a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000} 
```

I'm reducing my share again, but I'm still holding out for a larger share.  Inflation is really hurting me now, but I'm willing to compromise to avoid getting nothing at all. I'm hoping this will finally convince Bob to accept."
