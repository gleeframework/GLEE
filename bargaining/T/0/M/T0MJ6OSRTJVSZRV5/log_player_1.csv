Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to be greedy and offer Bob a small share.  I'm hoping he'll accept it to avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept this offer. While I'm getting a much smaller share than I hoped for, the inflation means that if I reject, my share will be worth even less in the next round. It's better to take what I can get now."
