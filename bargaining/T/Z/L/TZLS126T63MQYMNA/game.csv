900000.0,100000.0,"Bob, I'm feeling generous! Let's end this quickly. I take $900,000, you get $100,000. It's a great deal for you in the first round, considering the inflation!",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Alice, let's be fair and split the money evenly.  We can both walk away with a good amount and avoid the risk of inflation.",Bob,2,

850000.0,150000.0,"Bob, time is money, and it's losing value fast - especially for you! I'll take $850,000, you get $150,000.  It's better than what you offered last round, and waiting any longer just hurts you more.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Alice, let's compromise. I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share to avoid further inflation.  This offer is still fair, and we can both benefit from it.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
800000.0,200000.0,"Bob, the clock is ticking!  I'm offering $800,000 for me, and $200,000 for you. This is more than you've been offered before, and the longer this goes on, the less your share will be worth.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
600000.0,400000.0,"Alice, we're both losing money with every round. Let's cut our losses and settle on a reasonable split.  I'm offering you a slightly larger share to incentivize acceptance. This is the last offer I'll make before the inflation eats away at our gains even further.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
750000.0,250000.0,"Bob, I'm giving you one more chance to make a smart decision.  $250,000 is still a significant sum, but its value diminishes with every passing round.  Take this offer, and let's end this before inflation eats away at your potential gain any further.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
650000.0,350000.0,"Alice, we're getting dangerously close to the end of the game. I'm offering you a generous share, but I need to secure some for myself to avoid losing everything.  This is my final offer before we risk getting nothing at all.",Bob,8,
