"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob gets 40%."

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The tables have turned!

Since Bob's offer is the same as my initial offer, I'll reject it.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, the money is now worth 80% of its original value for me, and 90% of its original value for Bob. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000
}
```

I'm trying to be a bit more generous this time, but still keep a slight edge."

# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000
