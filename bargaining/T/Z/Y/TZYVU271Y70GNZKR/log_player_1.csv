Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a pretty lopsided offer. I figure Bob might take it to avoid the risk of getting nothing at all if we keep going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
It's better to take the 500,000 now than risk getting nothing in later rounds."
