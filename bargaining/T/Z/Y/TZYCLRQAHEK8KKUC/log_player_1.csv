"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and simple!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, as it's a straightforward and fair division of the $100. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, it's a good deal for me! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I need to consider the value of the money I'll receive in this round. With Bob's offer, I'll get $40, which is worth the same as $50 in the first round.

Considering this, I think Bob's offer is a bit too generous for him, and I'd like to try to get more. I'll reject his offer and make a new proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 45, but I need a bit more for myself""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than the 50/50 split in the first round. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small amount, but I need most of it to survive the inflation! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is taking a toll! With the money I gain still worth the same as in the first round, I need to consider the value of the money I'll receive in this round. However, I'm not sure if Bob's offer is a good deal for me.

Since Bob is getting 70, which is worth significantly more than 60 in the first round, I think he's taking advantage of the inflation. I'll try to negotiate a better deal.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 40, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of by inflation""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than the previous offers. I'm trying to balance getting a decent share with not being too greedy, considering the inflation. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
