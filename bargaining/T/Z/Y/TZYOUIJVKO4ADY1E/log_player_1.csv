"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I propose a 60/40 split in my favor, as I'm the one making the offer. This is a fair starting point, considering the inflation disadvantage Bob will face in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject this offer. While it's a slight improvement for me, it's still not a good deal considering the inflation disadvantage I'm facing. I'm hoping for a more equitable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5700, ""bob_gain"": 4300}
```

I'm offering a 57/43 split in my favor. This offer is a compromise, acknowledging the inflation disadvantage I'm facing while aiming for a fairer split than Bob's last offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though Bob's offer doesn't give me the most money, it's a fair and equal split, and the value of my share will continue to be devalued. Accepting this ends the game and avoids further inflation."
