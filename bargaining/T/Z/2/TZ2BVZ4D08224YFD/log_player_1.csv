"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a pretty aggressive offer. It's unlikely Bob will accept it, but it sets a high starting point and shows that I'm willing to be assertive. Let's see what he does."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is just as aggressive as mine, but in the opposite direction. I'm not going to accept this. Let's see if he'll back down a bit."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm going to reduce my share slightly, but still keeping a large majority. I think Bob will be more likely to accept this, since he clearly wants a lot of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is clearly being stubborn. I'm not going to give in to his demands, even though I'm starting to get worried about running out of time. I'll try a slightly more even offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

This time I'm going for a more equitable split.  It's a risk, but if Bob keeps rejecting my offers, he'll be the one who loses out on the time.  Hopefully, this shows that I'm willing to compromise."
