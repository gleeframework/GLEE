I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. This is a generous offer considering the potential for inflation.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though Bob is taking the majority of the money, accepting this offer is the best option for me. The inflation rate is much higher for Bob than for me, so my share is decreasing at a slower rate. It's better to secure a smaller portion now than to risk getting even less in future rounds."
