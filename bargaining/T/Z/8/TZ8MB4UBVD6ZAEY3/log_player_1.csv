"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm offering to take 60 dollars, leaving Bob with 40 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Considering the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll carefully consider Bob's offer. Since the money is worth less, I'd rather get more in this round to make up for it. However, I don't want to give up too much to Bob.

I'll reject this offer and wait for the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my revised proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55
}
```

I'm offering a slightly more generous split this time, taking 45 dollars and leaving Bob with 55 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of money!

Considering the significantly reduced value of the money, I'm willing to accept Bob's offer this time. I'd rather get something than risk getting nothing if we don't agree on a split.
