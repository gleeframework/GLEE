"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Take it or leave it?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. This is a relatively generous offer, considering the 5% inflation that will occur with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not afraid of a little risk, let's take it up a notch! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'll re-evaluate Bob's offer. Since the money is worth less now, I'd like to get a larger share. However, I'm not sure if I want to give up too much to Bob.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was not favorable, I'll try to make a new proposal that takes into account the increased inflation. I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the decreasing value of money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You're taking a risk, but I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share. Take it or leave it?""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'm taking a bigger cut this time! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really starting to take a toll on the value of the money! With the money being worth less, I'll need to be more cautious. However, Bob's offer is still not very appealing to me.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation accelerating, I'll need to be more aggressive in my proposal to ensure I get a decent share. I'll aim to get a larger share, but I'll also try to be realistic about the decreasing value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really eating away at the value of the money! With the money being worth less and less, I'll need to be extremely cautious. Bob's offer is still not very appealing to me, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of time running out.

Round 7
