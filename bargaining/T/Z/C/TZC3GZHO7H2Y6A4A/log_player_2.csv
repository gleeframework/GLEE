"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I take a bit more to start, and we can adjust as we go. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

It's too early to accept a deal where I get significantly less. I want to see how Alice's offers change as the rounds progress and the money loses value."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I propose a more balanced split this time.  Let's see if we can find a fair division before the money loses too much value.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's meet in the middle. This time I'm taking a smaller cut than my first offer, but it's still important that we settle this quickly. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Alice's offer is better than my previous offer and the money is losing value quickly. I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share to avoid losing everything."
