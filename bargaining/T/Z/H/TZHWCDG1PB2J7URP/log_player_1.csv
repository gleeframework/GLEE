"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 40%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this fair offer and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but it's still a good deal 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth less due to inflation, I'll have to be more cautious. However, Bob's offer is still a significant amount, and I don't want to risk losing out on a good deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer of $300,000 for me and $700,000 for him."
