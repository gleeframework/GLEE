Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not a fan of your time-is-money attitude, but I'm willing to compromise. This time, it's 60/40, take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer seems like a decent compromise, time is working against me more than it is against her. I need to push for a better split in the next few rounds while the money is still worth significantly more to me."
