"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you a small amount to get us going.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 80% of the original amount, and Bob will get 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I think I deserve more for starting the game 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one.

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I need to adjust my expectations. In the first round, $8000 was worth $7200 (80% of $9000, accounting for the 10% inflation), and now it's worth $6480 (80% of $8100). So, I need to be cautious.

Bob's offer of $6000 is equivalent to 75% of the original $8000 I offered him, which is a significant concession. However, I'm not sure if it's enough considering the inflation.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less again, my target amount should be adjusted accordingly. In the second round, $6000 was worth $5400 (80% of $6750, accounting for the 10% inflation), so I'll aim for a higher amount to account for the inflation.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7200,
  ""bob_gain"": 2800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think I deserve more considering the game is getting tougher 
# Alice gain: 6800 
# Bob gain: 3200 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is getting worse! Since the money is worth less, I need to be even more cautious.

Let's calculate the equivalent value of the amounts in the first round. In the first round, $8000 was worth $7200, and now it's worth $522.72 (27.1% of $1920, accounting for the 10% inflation in each of the 3 rounds). So, I need to be very careful with my decisions.

Bob's offer of $6800 is equivalent to 85% of the original $8000 I offered him, which is a significant concession. However, considering the inflation, it's still a relatively high amount.

I'll accept this offer, hoping that Bob will stick to his word.
