Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 80/20 split in my favor is fair, considering the value of money is decreasing. This way we both get a good share before it depreciates too much. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{
