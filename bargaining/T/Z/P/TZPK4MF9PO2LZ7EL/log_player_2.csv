{""bob_gain"": 80, ""alice_gain"": 20, ""message"": ""I think a 80/20 split in my favor is fair, considering the value of money is decreasing. This way we both get a good share before it depreciates too much.""}

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the decreasing value of money, I propose a 45/55 split. This maintains a balance while accounting for the inflation. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45
