```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $80 and Bob gets $20. This is a fair split, but I'm leaving room for negotiation."

# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less for me, so I need to be more cautious. Bob's offer is still quite skewed towards him, but I'll consider it.

```

```

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further. I'll make a new proposal in the next round."

# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is catching up! With the money worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I need to be more aggressive in my negotiations.

However, Bob's offer is still quite skewed towards him, and I'm not willing to accept it. I'll try to make a counteroffer that will give me a better deal.
