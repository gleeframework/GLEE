"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can finalize.""
}
```

This offer gives me $6,000 and Bob $4,000, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but it's a fair offer. Accept? 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, my initial gain of $6,000 is now worth $4,800.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully. Taking $2,500 is a significant reduction from my original offer, but it's still a decent amount. On the other hand, Bob is taking a substantial majority of the remaining money.

I'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round.

Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 48.8% less than the original, my potential gain is now worth 51.2% of the original value, which is $5,120 (10,000 * 0.512).

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully. Taking $1,500 is a very small amount, but it's better than nothing. On the other hand, Bob is taking a huge majority of the remaining money.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully. Taking $1,000 is a very small amount, and it's clear that Bob is trying to squeeze me dry. I'm not sure if it's worth it to continue negotiating at this point.
