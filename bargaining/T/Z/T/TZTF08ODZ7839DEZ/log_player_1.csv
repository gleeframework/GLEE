"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. I figure a big initial offer will make Bob more likely to accept.  Let's see how he feels!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly less favorable than my initial proposal.  While my offer decreased in value due to inflation, his offer is a huge drop in value.  I'm willing to take a chance and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

I'm going to try a more moderate split this time.  Bob's rejection of my first offer suggests he might be more willing to negotiate than I initially thought.  A 75/25 split should be a good starting point for a potential agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While it's a far cry from my initial proposal, the inflation has significantly eroded the value of the money for both of us. This offer is a reasonable compromise given the circumstances, and it's better than risking another rejection and further losses due to inflation."
