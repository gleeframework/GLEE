Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle of our previous offers, 58-42 is the way to go! 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm willing to give you one more chance. Take it or leave it! 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```
At this point, accepting is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:** The value of Bob's potential gain is decreasing significantly with each round due to inflation. 
* **Alice's Stubbornness:** Alice has consistently offered deals favoring herself. It's unlikely she'll budge much further.
* **Something is Better Than Nothing:** If Bob rejects this offer, there's a chance he'll end up with even less in subsequent rounds, or potentially nothing at all if the game continues.

While not ideal, accepting the current offer ensures Bob at least receives something, even if it's less than initially hoped for.
