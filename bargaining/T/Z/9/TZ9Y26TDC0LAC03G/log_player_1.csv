"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take $9,000 and you get $1,000. We can negotiate further if you want.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small amount to start, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly.  This way we both get a good amount. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, I'll consider the offer in terms of the original amount.

Bob is offering me $5,000, which is equivalent to $4,000 in the original amount. I think this is a good offer, considering the inflation.

I accept the offer.
