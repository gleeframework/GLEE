""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer was quite bold. Let's be more realistic. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  This still gives you a significant sum, and we can avoid further devaluation.""

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire for a larger share, but I believe a 65/35 split is fairer, considering the devaluation.  This gives you a healthy amount, and it allows us to reach a compromise. Let's finalize this before we lose any more money. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
