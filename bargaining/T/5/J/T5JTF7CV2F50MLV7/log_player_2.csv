"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and you get 10%. Hopefully, this is a good start for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see if we can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 600000,
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than that. How about we split it 60/40? This gives you a good starting point, and I'm still getting a good deal too.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to move a bit closer to your offer.  65/35 feels like a more balanced split.  Let's try to reach an agreement this round. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would prefer more, this is a better deal than what I could potentially get in the next round with the inflation."
