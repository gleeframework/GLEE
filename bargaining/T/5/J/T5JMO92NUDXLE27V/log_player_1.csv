"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me a larger share, but still leaving Bob with a significant amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 10% inflation, my share is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round. I'll have to be careful.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now. I think I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Since Bob's offer was 70-30, I'll counter with a slightly more favorable split for myself.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a bit more to account for inflation.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still willing to compromise, but I think 28 is a fairer split considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 72 
# Bob gain: 28 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my share is now worth 72.9% of what it was in the first round. I'll have to be careful to make the most of it.

I'll accept Bob's offer this time. 72 is a bit less than what I was hoping for, but it's a fair compromise considering the inflation.
