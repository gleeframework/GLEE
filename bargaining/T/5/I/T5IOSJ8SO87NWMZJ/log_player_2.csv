Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're getting closer. I'm willing to lower my share slightly, but we need to find a solution that's fair for both of us.  Let's work together. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is steadily increasing her offer to Bob, but it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  The longer the game goes on, the less Bob's potential gains are worth due to inflation. While Alice's message sounds conciliatory, she's still benefiting greatly from Bob's losses to inflation.  Bob needs to hold firm and push for a more equitable split, even if it risks getting nothing."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to lower my share again, but it needs to be closer to a 50/50 split. We have to find a solution that benefits both of us, or we risk losing everything. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Time is running out, and Alice's offer is the closest it's been to a reasonable split. While not ideal, accepting this offer guarantees Bob a reasonable share before inflation eats away too much of his potential gains. Rejecting this offer carries a significant risk of walking away with nothing if a deal can't be reached in the remaining rounds."
