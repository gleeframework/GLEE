"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. Fair is fair. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
Let's see what Alice has to offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than a 50/50 split.  This offer gives you a good share, but I still get a larger portion since I'm taking the risk of you rejecting this and forcing us into another round.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob.  This offer gives you a slight advantage, but I still get a fair share. Let's end this game before the inflation hits us too hard. 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
This offer gives me a good gain while also ending the game quickly.  Alice is losing a good chunk of her potential gains due to inflation, and continuing the game only risks further losses for both of us."
