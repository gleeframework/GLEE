Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I believe a 60/40 split in my favor is fairer, considering the time constraints and the diminishing value of the money for you. Let's reach a mutually agreeable solution before it's too late. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000
