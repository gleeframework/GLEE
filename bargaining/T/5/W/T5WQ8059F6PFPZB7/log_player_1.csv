"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This offer gives me 80% of the initial $10,000, and Bob gets the remaining 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less after the first round, and now it's worth 20% less again, that means the money is now worth 64% of its original value.

I'll accept Bob's offer, but the actual amounts I'll gain and Bob will gain are:

* Alice gain: 3840
* Bob gain: 2560

I'll accept this offer.
