Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:** While not ideal, accepting this offer is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** We're over halfway through the rounds. The longer this goes on, the less money we both get.
* **Diminishing Returns:** The 59.04% inflation rate means the money is rapidly losing value.  Even if I hold out for a slightly better offer in later rounds, the actual gain might be insignificant compared to accepting now.
* **Uncertain Future:**  There's no guarantee Alice will offer anything better. She might even get greedier, and we'll both end up with nothing. 

It's a tough decision, but sometimes taking a decent offer in a negotiation is better than risking everything for a slightly better outcome."
