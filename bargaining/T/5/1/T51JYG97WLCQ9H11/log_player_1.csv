"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60-40""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable considering I'm making the first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it in half, no negotiations! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 50-50 split, but considering the pressure of the time constraint and the decreasing value of the money, I'll accept Bob's offer.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
