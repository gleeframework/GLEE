"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where each of us gets $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking a slight risk here, but I'm confident I can get a better deal for myself in the long run.  I'm offering you 4000, and keeping 6000 for myself.  Let's see what you think. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with this offer. I was hoping for a more even split, and this proposal is quite lopsided. I'm willing to take a risk and reject this offer in hopes of getting a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I still want a decent share. How about this?""}

I'm proposing a slightly more lopsided split, with me getting $4,500 and Bob getting $5,500. I'm hoping this will be more acceptable to Bob."
