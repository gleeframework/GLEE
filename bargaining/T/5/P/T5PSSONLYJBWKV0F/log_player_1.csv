Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 5500

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is eating into my share, I need a bigger cut to make up for it. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is getting increasingly aggressive, but his offers are not reflecting the actual depreciation. While he is experiencing a loss, it's not a valid reason to demand a significantly larger share. I'll hold out for a more reasonable offer."
