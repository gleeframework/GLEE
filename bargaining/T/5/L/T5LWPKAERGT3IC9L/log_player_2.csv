"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. Fair is fair! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 10% less for Alice in each subsequent round, I might be able to negotiate a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think 60-40 is a fair deal. You'll lose value if we keep going!""}\n\n###\n\nI'm trying to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth 10% less for Alice in each subsequent round, so I'm offering her a smaller share in the hopes that she'll accept before the value decreases further."
