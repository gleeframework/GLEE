"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the $100 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","My offer was rejected, and now Bob is offering me 45% of the money. I'll have to think carefully about this one...

I'll decide to reject this offer as well.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","In round 3, the money is worth 20% less than in round 2. Since Bob's offer was 55% of the money, which is more than my previous offer, I'll try to make a more generous offer this time.

Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept this time."
