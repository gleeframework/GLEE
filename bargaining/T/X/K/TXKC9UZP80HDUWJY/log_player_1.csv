"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

This is a fairly aggressive opening offer, aiming to secure the majority of the money.  It leaves some room for negotiation, but shows that I am willing to fight for a good share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would ideally get more, accepting this offer secures a decent amount of the money. The risk of rejection in the next round would result in a smaller share for me, especially considering the 5% devaluation for Bob.  It's a good compromise."
