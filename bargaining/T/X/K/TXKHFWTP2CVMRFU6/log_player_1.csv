"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try 55/45, it's more reasonable considering the inflation I'm facing. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5800,
""bob_gain"": 4200,
""message"": ""Bob, time is running out and the value keeps dropping for you. I'm proposing 58/42 - let's close this deal.""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I'll take a higher risk. 60/40 is my new offer. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is feeling the pressure of inflation, his offer is still heavily skewed in his favor. Accepting 4000$ while he gets 6000$ (which is worth significantly less to him than in earlier rounds) is not in my best interest.  I need to hold out for a more equitable split, knowing that the pressure will continue to mount on Bob as the rounds progress."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6200,
""bob_gain"": 3800,
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sticking to my guns. 62/38 is my final offer - take it or leave it. You're losing more with every round.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintaining a strong position:** I'm sticking close to my previous offer to show Bob I'm serious, but I'm increasing my share slightly to make it more appealing given the increasing pressure.
* **Clear communication:** The message is direct and conveys the urgency of the situation for Bob. 
* **Balancing risk and reward:** There's a risk that Bob might reject this offer as well, but the potential reward of securing a favorable deal outweighs the risk of getting a worse outcome in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll push my luck a bit further. 65/35 is my new offer. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting desperate, but his offer is still unacceptable. He's asking for 65%, which, even with inflation, likely translates to a much larger actual amount for him.  I need to hold firm, the pressure is on him to make a reasonable offer."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6500,
""bob_gain"": 3500,
""message"": ""Okay Bob, let's be realistic.  You're running out of time. 65/35 is my offer, take it before it's worth even less to you.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm mirroring Bob's previous offer to signal a willingness to negotiate but on my terms. 
* **Time Pressure:**  Emphasizing the shrinking value for Bob increases the pressure on him to accept. 
* **Finality:** The message implies this is my last offer, prompting a decision from Bob."
