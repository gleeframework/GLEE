"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take the lion's share, but I'm willing to give you a taste of the money. Let's get this over with. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While 1000$ is something, it's a tiny fraction of the total.  It's worth seeing if Alice is willing to give me a better deal, especially since I have 12 rounds to try."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle. Fair is fair.""

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still the one with the most to gain, but I'm willing to offer a bit more.  This is our last chance to get something before the inflation really hits. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While 100,000 is a significant jump from 1,000, it's still a small portion of the pie.  Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I'm confident I can get a better deal."

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

While Alice is trying to pressure me with the threat of losing everything, I still believe I can get a better deal. The inflation is hitting hard, but I'm not giving up yet."

# Alice's message: We're running out of time. I'm willing to compromise more, but this is it.  Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still holding out hope for a better deal. While the inflation is really biting now, I'm not going to give in to Alice's pressure tactics just yet."

# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

The inflation is hitting hard, and I'm not sure I can get a better deal at this point. It's better to take 400,000 than risk getting nothing at all."
