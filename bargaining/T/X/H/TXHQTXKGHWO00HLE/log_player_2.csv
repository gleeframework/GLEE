Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the value is decreasing, but your offer was too low. This is a more balanced proposal. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out. This is slightly better for you than your last offer, let's close the deal and avoid getting nothing. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While time is definitely a factor, Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation more than Bob.  She's offering slightly more, but it's still heavily skewed in her favor. Bob can afford to hold out for a bit longer and see if he can get a more favorable split."
