"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm offering a 50/50 split, where we each get $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'll consider the actual value of the offer. For me, the offer would be:

$580,000 / 0.95 = $610,526

And for Bob, the offer would be:

$420,000 / 0.8 = $525,000

Considering the actual values, I think this is a relatively good offer for me. I'll accept Bob's offer.
