Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","The inflation is really devastating my potential gain. I'll try to make a very aggressive offer, hoping Bob will accept it before things get even worse.

}

I'm essentially reverting back to my previous offer from round 3, hoping Bob will accept it now that the stakes are higher."
