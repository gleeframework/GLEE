Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going for a  fairly aggressive first offer. I'm hoping to get a large chunk of the money early on before inflation kicks in too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer to get more, the inflation means I'm losing money every round. Accepting this offer guarantees I get half, which is better than risking getting less in later rounds."
