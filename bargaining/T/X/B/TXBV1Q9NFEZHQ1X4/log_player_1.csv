I propose to take $90 and give Bob $10.  I figure this is a fair starting point, as it gives me a significant advantage, but still allows Bob to get something.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'm losing 30 dollars from my initial offer, I also have to account for the inflation. Taking 60 dollars now is equivalent to taking about 63.15 dollars in the previous round. This is still a good deal, especially since Bob is losing a significant amount due to the inflation on his side."
