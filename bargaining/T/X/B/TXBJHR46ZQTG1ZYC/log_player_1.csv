Let's see if Bob is happy with a 90/10 split.  I figure I'll take the lion's share since I'm making the first offer, but I'll be generous enough to leave him with something.  We'll see how this inflation thing plays out!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more money, I know that if I reject this offer, the next round I'll only be able to get 900, and that's a huge drop compared to the 1000 I'm getting now. It's better to take what I can get, especially since I'm not sure how the inflation is affecting Bob."
