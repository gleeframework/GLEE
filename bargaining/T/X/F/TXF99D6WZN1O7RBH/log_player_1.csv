I'm going for a slightly unfair split in my favor, but leaving Bob with a small amount to hopefully make him think it's worth accepting.  Let's see what Bob does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

A 50/50 split is fair and ensures we both get something. There's no point in risking getting nothing by rejecting and continuing the game."
