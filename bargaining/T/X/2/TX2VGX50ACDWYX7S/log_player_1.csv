"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split is more fair, with me taking the larger share this time. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll respond with a decision to reject Bob's offer.
