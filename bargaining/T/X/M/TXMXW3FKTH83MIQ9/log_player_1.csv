"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'm willing to compromise and give you 400k. What do you say?""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but you'll have to negotiate better if you want more! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is already hitting me hard!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully. With the money being worth 20% less, $100,000 is now equivalent to $80,000 in real value. It's a small share, but I don't want to give up too much at this stage.

I'll decide to reject Bob's offer for now and try to negotiate further.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise further. I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I still need to get a decent amount for myself. What's your next move?""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving you more than 30% of the total, that's my final offer! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is really taking a toll on me now. With the money being worth 48.8% less, $300,000 is now equivalent to $157,200 in real value. It's a decent offer, but I'm not sure if I want to settle for such a small share, especially since I was hoping for more.

However, I don't want to risk going into the next round with even less purchasing power. I'll decide to accept Bob's offer.
