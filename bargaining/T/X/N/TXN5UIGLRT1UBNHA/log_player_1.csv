"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose that I receive $900,000 and Bob receives $100,000.  This is a fair offer considering the inflation we will both face if we don't agree.  Let's end this quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 855000, ""bob_gain"": 145000}
```

I propose that I receive $855,000 and Bob receives $145,000.  Since my offer was rejected last round, I'm taking a smaller percentage, but I am still offering Bob a good amount.  I am hoping we can settle this quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 145000 
# Bob gain: 855000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While the amount I am getting is significantly less than what I was aiming for, I need to acknowledge the rapid inflation Bob is facing.  At this point, any money is better than none, as the longer we play, the less valuable the money will become for both of us."
