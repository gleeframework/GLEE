Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose we split the money 90/10 in my favor.  I'm taking a risk with a high initial offer, hoping to secure the money quickly and avoid inflation.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject Bob's offer. While I would get a small amount, it's not worth it to accept such an unfair split, especially considering the inflation. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal in the following rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to 70/30.  The inflation is starting to bite, but I still believe I can get a good deal for myself. Let's see if Bob is willing to compromise."
