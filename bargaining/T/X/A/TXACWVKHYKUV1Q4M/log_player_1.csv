"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very generous offer for Bob, hoping he'll accept and we can both be happy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 280000 
# Bob gain: 720000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, the inflation rate makes accepting this offer the best option.  Waiting for another round will only reduce the value of the money I get, and there's no guarantee Bob will offer me a better deal."
