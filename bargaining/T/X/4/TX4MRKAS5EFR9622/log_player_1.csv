"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 450k, and I'll take the rest.""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount of money, and we can negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 400k, but I want the majority of the pie 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'm not as eager to accept a smaller share.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob to make another offer, hoping to get a better deal."

  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share this time. Take it or leave it!""
}
```"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger risk and give you a smaller share, but I think it's worth it 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 27.1% less for me and 14.26% less for Bob, I'm getting a bit desperate. But I still don't want to give up too much.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll try to hold out for a better deal, but I'm not sure how much longer I can resist Bob's offers."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer, hoping to get a better deal before the money becomes even less valuable.

  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Time's running out, let's split it 50/50. Take it or leave it!""
