"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is 40% of the initial amount, and keeping $600,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm trying to get a better deal. Your turn to counter! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, the offer from Bob is equivalent to $800,000 / 0.8 = $1,000,000 in the first round, which is the full amount.

I'll reject this offer since it's not a good deal for me.
