70.0,30.0,"Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I take $70, you take $30.  It's in your best interest to agree sooner rather than later.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
50.0,50.0,"Let's be fair. I propose we split the money evenly.  This way, we both get a decent share and avoid further rounds of negotiation.",Bob,2,
,,"While I appreciate the sentiment of fairness, Bob, remember that the value of the money decreases with each round - especially for you. I'm willing to negotiate, but a 50/50 split isn't appealing at this stage.",Alice,2,reject
65.0,35.0,"Okay, Bob, let's try this again.  I'll take $65, you get $35.  The longer this goes on, the less your share will be worth.  It's better to take a decent offer now.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
60.0,40.0,"I'm willing to compromise a bit further, but I need a bigger share than 35.  Let's split it 60/40 in your favor, and we can both avoid further losses.",Bob,4,
,,"Alright, Bob, you drive a hard bargain. I accept the 60/40 split.",Alice,4,accept
