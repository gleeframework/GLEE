Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was a bit unfair. Let's be reasonable - I take 60, you take 40.  This deal benefits us both before inflation hurts us further. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60
