"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, Alice. It's still a fair split, but I'll take a bit more this time. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $4,000 is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so it's actually $3,600.

I'll reject Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think I can do better than this."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a bit more, but I'm still willing to compromise, Bob!""
}
```

I'm trying to take a slightly larger share, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, Alice. Let's split it 50/50 this time. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $7,000 in Round 3 is now worth 72.9% of what it was in the first round, so it's actually $5,073.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

A 50/50 split seems like a reasonable compromise, especially considering the decreasing value of money due to inflation."
