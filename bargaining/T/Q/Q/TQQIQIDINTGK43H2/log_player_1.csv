Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm starting with a 90/10 split in my favor.  It's a bit aggressive, but I want to see how Bob reacts.  Hopefully, he'll accept and we can both get something.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. Even with the 5% inflation, 5000 is better than nothing.  It seems like he's willing to be fair, so I don't want to risk losing everything by continuing to play."
