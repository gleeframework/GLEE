"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this split reflects the urgency for both of us to settle early, but with a slight advantage for me considering the faster inflation rate I face. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's tempting to get something now, I know that the inflation will hurt Alice more than me, so I think I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I understand your need for a faster settlement, but I believe this split is more fair considering the inflation rates. Let's get this done quickly.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but it still heavily favors you in the long run.  This is my final offer, let's settle before inflation eats away at our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice's offer is getting closer to what I initially wanted, and the inflation is starting to become a real factor. I'm willing to accept this to avoid further losses."
