"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 4:1, you get 20% and I get 80% 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see if we can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair - I'll take 60%, you take 40%.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're asking for 60%, that's too greedy! I'll give you 55% and keep 45% 
# Bob gain: 2800 
# Alice gain: 7200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While it's not a great deal, it's better than getting nothing in the later rounds due to inflation."
