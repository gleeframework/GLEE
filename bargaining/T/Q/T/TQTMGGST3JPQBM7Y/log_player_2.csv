"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Not budging much, inflation is on my side 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the pressure is on, accepting this offer would mean losing a significant amount of potential earnings due to inflation.  It's better to hold out a little longer and hope Alice becomes more willing to compromise."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Okay, Alice, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical option.  Every round we delay costs us both money. Let's be smart and end this.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Half is not fair considering inflation, I'll give a little 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The game has reached a critical point. While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice for a few reasons:

* **Severe Inflation:**  The 46.86% inflation has significantly eroded Bob's potential gains. Waiting longer risks even greater losses.
* **Alice's Stance:**  Alice has consistently offered deals slightly favoring her. It's unlikely she'll drastically shift her position at this stage.
* **Time Pressure:** With only 5 rounds remaining, the risk of walking away with nothing significantly increases. 

Accepting this offer secures a reasonable sum for Bob, even with the impact of inflation, and avoids the risk of complete loss."
