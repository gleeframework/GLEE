"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a very generous offer to Bob. I know that the money will be worth less for him with each round, so I'm trying to secure a quick agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is a mirror of my first offer, but with the values reversed. I'm still in a much stronger position, as the inflation hurts Bob more. I'll reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my offer slightly from the previous round.  The inflation is still working in my favor, and I'm aiming to secure a deal before the next round when Bob will get to make a proposal again.  The offer is still generous, and hopefully, Bob will see the value in accepting it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While the inflation is still affecting Bob more than me, the gap is narrowing. The next round will be even more disadvantageous for him. I'm taking this offer now to avoid the risk of getting a worse deal in the next round."
