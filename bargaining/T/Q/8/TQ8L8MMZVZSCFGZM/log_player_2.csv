Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's just split it evenly this time.  I'm not sure how much inflation will affect us in the future, so a 50/50 split seems like the safest option. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
