"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a fair share, let's end it here!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself. The message is a friendly one, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but still a good one! 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less in the second round, my gain of $600,000 is actually worth $480,000, and Bob's gain of $400,000 is worth $320,000.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 40% less than in the first round (20% less in each of the previous two rounds), my goal is to maximize my gain while still being reasonable.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting the better deal, let's make it fair!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time to get serious, I'll take a bigger share this time! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, my gain of $450,000 is actually worth $225,000, and Bob's gain of $550,000 is worth $275,000.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, as Bob is taking a bigger share... but it's still a relatively small amount.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 76.8% less than in the first round (20% less in each of the previous four rounds), my goal is to get as much as I can while still being reasonable.

Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""bob_gain"": 600000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bigger share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, but I'll give you a chance to think about it! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 67.23% less than in the first round, my gain of $300,000 is actually worth $98,290. 

I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'm starting to get desperate. I don't want to give Bob too much more.
