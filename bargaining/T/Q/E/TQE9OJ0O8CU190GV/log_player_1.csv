"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial amount, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of 450,000 is now worth less than my initial offer of 600,000. I'll have to think carefully...

I'll decide to reject Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob's offer was 550,000 for him and 450,000 for me, and I rejected it, I'll try to make a more favorable offer for myself this time.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me calculate the value of my gain in the first round, which was 600,000. With 5% inflation each round, the value of my gain in the fourth round would be 600,000 * (0.95)^3 = 500,950. But since the inflation is 14.26% less than in the first round, my gain in the fourth round is actually 600,000 * (0.95)^3 * (0.854) = 424,113.

Considering this, Bob's offer of 475,000 is actually a better deal for me than my initial offer in the third round, which was 550,000. I'll decide to accept Bob's offer.
