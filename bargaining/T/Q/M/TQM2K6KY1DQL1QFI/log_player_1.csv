"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial 100$ and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bigger share, but I'm not being too generous 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

After considering Bob's offer, I'm going to:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about the 30% share for Bob, and I was hoping for a more generous offer. I'll wait for the next round to make a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, let's meet in the middle""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping that Bob will accept this more balanced proposal."
