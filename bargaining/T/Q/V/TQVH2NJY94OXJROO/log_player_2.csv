"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60/40, I think that's fair. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 20% less for me with each passing round, I'd like to try to get a better deal. Please let me know when it's my turn to make a proposal.\n\n###\n\nAlso, just to clarify, when I make my proposal, will I be able to describe it in a few words like Alice did? And will the gains be displayed for both of us like they were in Alice's offer?"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 55/45 is fair considering the inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's just split it evenly this time. Inflation is hurting both of us, and a 50/50 split is the fairest way to go. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI think a 50/50 split is a reasonable offer, especially considering the inflation. Since the money is worth 36% less for me than in the first round, I'd rather accept this offer than risk losing even more value in future rounds."
