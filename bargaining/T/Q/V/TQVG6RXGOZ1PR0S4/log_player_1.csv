"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a proposal that benefits me slightly more. I want to see if Bob is willing to accept a small share in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'll reject this offer. Although I am getting some money, it's still not a good deal given the inflation and the fact that I can propose a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split. It's a fair deal considering the inflation and the fact that I have the power to make the proposal. I believe Bob is likely to accept this offer to avoid risking further rounds and potentially getting nothing."
