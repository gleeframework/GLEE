Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe in fairness too, but I also value my time. Let's settle this now. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Bob, this offer is still the fairest. Let's wrap this up.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time pressure on Bob:**  Bob's money is devaluing faster (20% per round) compared to Alice's (10% per round). This makes him more eager to settle quickly.
* **Maintain a strong position:** While I could be more flexible, sticking to a 60/40 split keeps the pressure on Bob. He needs to decide if risking another round is worth a potentially smaller gain. 
* **Clear communication:**  The message emphasizes fairness and aims to end the negotiation quickly. 

It's a gamble, but with each round, the time pressure on Bob increases, making my offer more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time. This offer is my final concession. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant devaluation:** The money is losing value rapidly. Accepting 4800 now is better than risking a worse offer or even reaching a point where the entire sum is significantly diminished. 
* **Bob's finality:**  His message implies this is his last offer. Holding out might force him to accept a less favorable deal in a future round, but there's also a risk he'll stick to his position.
* **Slightly better than 50/50:** While not ideal, accepting a slightly less favorable split now avoids the risk of ending up with a significantly worse outcome later."
