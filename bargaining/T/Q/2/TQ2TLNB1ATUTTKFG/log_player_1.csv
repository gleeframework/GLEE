Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60/40 is a good starting point, but I'd like to see a bit more for myself. How about we split it 60/40, with me getting the larger share this time? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
