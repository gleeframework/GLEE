"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting us nowhere. Let's be reasonable. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I need you to meet me halfway. 55/45 seems fair considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
