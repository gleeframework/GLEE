"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which is a relatively fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gain, I need to be more cautious. I'll think carefully about this offer.

After considering it, I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not sure if I'm being too greedy or not, but I'd like to keep negotiating!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation has affected my gain, I'll make a new offer that takes this into account. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

This time, I'm offering a slightly more favorable split to myself, considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation."
