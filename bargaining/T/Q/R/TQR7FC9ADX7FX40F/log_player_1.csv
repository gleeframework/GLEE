Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a very lopsided split in my favor. I'm aware of the inflation factor, but I believe it's advantageous for me to take the most I can in the first round, while Bob loses the least in value.  Let's see if Bob is willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While it's not ideal, accepting this offer is the best option for me.  Bob is now getting the lion's share, and I'm not sure I'll be able to get a better offer in the next round.  I'll take the $400,000 and call it a day."
