I'm starting with a generous offer to Bob, hoping to end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is much less favorable to me than my initial offer, and I'm confident I can do better.  I'll take advantage of the inflation working in my favor and make a more balanced counter-proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor, as the inflation has made Bob's offer less attractive and I'm aiming for a more balanced outcome."
