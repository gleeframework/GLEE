Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Don't be stubborn, this is a good deal 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is consistently offering slightly more than half to herself, taking advantage of Bob's shrinking pot.  While the offer is getting closer to a reasonable split, Bob still has some leverage and rounds left. It's time for a stronger stance to show Alice he's serious about getting a better deal."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Enough games, Alice.  A 50/50 split is the only fair option.  Let's end this.""}"

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm not. Think about it. 
# Bob gain: 4100 
# Alice gain: 5900 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is correct - Bob is losing value quickly. While this offer isn't ideal, it's better than any previous offer from Alice and significantly better than risking getting nothing if this drags on.  Alice seems unwilling to budge, and Bob needs to secure something before inflation eats further into his potential gains."
