"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and you get 10%.  Let me know if you'd like to negotiate further.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle.  I'll take 55% and you take 45%. We're both losing value with each round, so let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is getting closer to a reasonable split, time is working against her more than me.  I'm willing to push my luck a bit further to see if I can secure a better deal."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6500,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to move a bit closer to your last offer, but I need a better deal than 35%.  Let's split it 45/55.  We're both losing money, so let's reach an agreement before it's too late. 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  This offer is better than what Alice originally proposed, and the effects of inflation are getting increasingly significant for her. Accepting now secures me a favorable split, whereas continuing to push for a slightly better deal carries the risk of ending up with nothing if we fail to agree."
