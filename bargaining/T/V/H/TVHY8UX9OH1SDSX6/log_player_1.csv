"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}

I'm offering a 50/50 split, which seems fair to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Considering the inflation, my gain of 4000 is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, which is 4500. This offer is a bit more skewed towards Bob, but I'll consider it. I'll accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
