Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair and simple start!""}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, which I think is a fair and reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

# Bob's message: A 50/50 split, a fair start to the game! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50
