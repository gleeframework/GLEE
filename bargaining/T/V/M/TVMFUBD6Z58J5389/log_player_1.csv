Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```
I'm offering to take $6,000 and leaving $4,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, my offer would have been 4800 for me and 2200 for Bob. Bob's offer is 5000 each, which is better than my previous offer. I'll accept this offer.
