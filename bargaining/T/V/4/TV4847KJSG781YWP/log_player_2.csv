"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Let's see if I can get a better deal. ðŸ˜‰"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the potential for inflation.  What do you think?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly bigger share. How about we try 55/45? 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a better deal, the inflation is a significant factor. Accepting this offer ensures I get something, even with the loss from inflation."
