"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's start with a fair offer. I propose I take $70 and you take $30.  This way, we both benefit from reaching an agreement early on.

# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 40, ""alice_gain"": 60, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, your offer was a bit too skewed in your favor. Let's be more reasonable. How about a 60/40 split?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your point of view. Let's meet somewhere in the middle. I propose $65 for me and $35 for you. Time is ticking, and it would be a shame if we both lost out due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to find a compromise here.  $60 for me and $40 for you seems like a fair deal considering the time pressure. Let's not let this opportunity slip away. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 
 
This is a tough one, but I'll accept.  Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:**  With each round, the deal gets worse for Alice, but the risk of getting $0 increases for both of us. We're already at round 5 out of 12.
* **Decent Offer:** While I'd prefer the 55/45 split, getting $40 is a decent amount. It's significantly better than risking getting $0 in later rounds if negotiations completely fall apart. 

Let's close the deal, Alice!"
