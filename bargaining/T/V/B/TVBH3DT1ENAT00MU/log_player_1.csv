"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your sense of fairness is a little off. How about a 55/45 split in my favor?  Think carefully, the clock is ticking (and inflation is biting). 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
