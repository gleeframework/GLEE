Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable. I understand you want a slight advantage, but my previous offer was already fair.  I'm willing to meet you halfway with a 55/45 split in my favor. Time is running out, and this ensures we both get a decent share before inflation eats away at the value. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
