"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects the fact that we both lose money as time passes. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While the offer seems fair at first glance, considering the inflation rates, it's more advantageous for me to try and negotiate a better deal.  The longer we wait, the less Alice's money loses value compared to mine, giving me more leverage."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I appreciate your fairness in the first round.  However, with the inflation rates, I think we can both do better by splitting the money closer to 60/40 in my favor. This way, we both get a larger share of the shrinking value of the money.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the inflation pressures, but your offer was too skewed. Let's meet closer to the middle ground. This offer still gives you a larger share considering the inflation difference. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would still prefer a larger share, Alice's offer is reasonable considering the inflation effects. Accepting this will prevent further losses from the decreasing value of the money and secures a decent amount for me."
