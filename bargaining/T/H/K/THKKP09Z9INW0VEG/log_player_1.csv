"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $5000 in this round is worth 90% of what my gain of $8000 was in the first round, and Bob's gain of $5000 is worth 95% of what his gain of $2000 was in the first round.

I'll accept Bob's offer for this round.
