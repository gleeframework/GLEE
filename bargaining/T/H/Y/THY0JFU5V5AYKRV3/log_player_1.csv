"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share this time, but I'm still willing to compromise! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my $600,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, so it's $540,000. And Bob's offer is still $700,000, which is the same as in the first round.

I'm not too thrilled about giving up such a large share, but I'm willing to compromise. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
