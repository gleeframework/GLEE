"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can finalize the deal.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000, which is a relatively small amount, but it's a good starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can finalize the deal quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair. Let's move forward and get this done. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the money is worth less, so I need to be more cautious.

I'm not sure about the 60/40 split, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I'd like to make a counteroffer to try to get a better deal.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure about the 60/40 split. I'd like to propose a 55/45 split instead. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm hoping that by proposing a 55/45 split, I can get a slightly better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth 10% less than in round 2. So, the total amount of money is now worth 90% of what it was in round 2.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. This 55/45 split is a fair offer.""
}
```

I'm increasing my gain to 4200, which is a bit more than the 55% I proposed earlier. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finalize the deal."
