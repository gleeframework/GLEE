# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
 
With the inflation rate, Bob is losing a significant amount of money each round. Even though this offer is not ideal, it's better than getting nothing at all.  It's time to accept the offer and secure at least some money."
