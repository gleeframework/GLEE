"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can both go home happy!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount, but it's a fair deal considering the risk of inflation. If Bob accepts, I'll get $900,000, which is a significant amount, but I'm willing to compromise to end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. Fair is fair. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","A more even split! I'll consider it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation taking its toll, I need to be more aggressive in my offer. Here's my next proposal:

  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting the better deal, Bob. This is my final offer!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share, but I'm still being generous considering the inflation. It's time for Bob to make a move!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000

```
{

I'm not convinced that this is a fair split, especially considering the inflation. I'll keep pushing for a better deal."

# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings now! I need to think carefully about this offer. Here's my decision:
