"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fairer, given the inflation rates we're dealing with. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rates, my gain of $4,500 is worth 80% of what it would have been in the first round, and Bob's gain of $5,500 is worth 95% of what it would have been in the first round.

I don't think a 55/45 split is fair, considering the inflation rates are affecting me more harshly. I'll reject the offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation rates, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth less with each round, I'll aim to get a larger share now to make up for it.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it! The value of money is decreasing fast!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're both losing money with each round. Let's make a deal before it gets worse! I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal than before. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rates, my gain of $4,000 is worth 40% of what it would have been in the first round, and Bob's gain of $6,000 is worth 60% of what it would have been in the first round.

I'm not sure I'm ready to settle for a smaller share, especially considering the inflation rates are still in my favor. I'll reject the offer.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation rates, I'll try to get an even larger share now to compensate for the decreasing value of money. Since the money is worth even less with each round, I'll aim to get a larger share to make up for it.

  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""Last chance to make a deal! I'm taking a risk, but I think it's worth it.""
