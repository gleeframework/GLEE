Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and end this game!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $1,000,000 equally, with each of us getting $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with Bob's offer. I was hoping for a more equal split, and giving me only $200,000 is not acceptable. I think I deserve more than that. I'll reject this offer and make a new one in the next round."

# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm really unhappy with this offer. The consolation prize of $100,000 is barely enough to cover the inflation, and I'm still being offered a tiny fraction of the total amount. I think Bob is being very unfair and I don't want to accept this offer. I'll reject it and try to make a better one in the next round."

I'm proposing that I get $250,000 and Bob gets $750,000. I'm trying to be more generous again, but I'm getting worried that I won't get a fair deal if I don't make a good offer soon."
