"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. Fair is fair, even with inflation. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money is worth less with each round, I'd like to get a bit more to compensate for the decreasing value. However, Bob's offer is a fair one, and I don't want to risk going to the next round.
