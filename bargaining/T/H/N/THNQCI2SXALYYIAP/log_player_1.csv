"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

I'm going to try to be as greedy as possible while still giving Bob something to ensure he accepts the offer.  Let's see if he bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is getting much greedier, but I'm not ready to settle for such a small share.  I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000} 
```

I'm still aiming for a large share, but I've reduced my offer slightly to try and tempt Bob into accepting.  The inflation is starting to get to me!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still being very greedy, but I'm holding out for a better deal. The inflation is affecting him more than me, so I'm hoping he'll eventually come around."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000} 
```

I'm still aiming for a large share, but I'm starting to get nervous about the inflation.  This is my last chance to make an offer for a while, and I need to find a balance between being greedy and ensuring Bob accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm starting to feel the pressure from inflation.  I'm not happy with a 50/50 split, but it's better than getting nothing.  Hopefully, Bob will be more reasonable in future rounds if we both survive this."
