"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. You get 10% and I get the rest. This is a good first step towards a mutually beneficial outcome.

# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer was quite unbalanced. Let's be more realistic. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This considers that future rounds devalue the money significantly for both of us, especially you.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the devaluation of money. However, your offer is still too lopsided.  Let's split the difference and go for 55/45. This is a fair compromise that considers both our interests. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to a reasonable split, it's still heavily in her favor considering the rapid devaluation of the money.  Each round significantly hurts her more than me. I need to push for a more favorable outcome in the next round while the money is still worth something significant."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 540000,
""alice_gain"": 460000,
""message"": ""Alice, we need to reach an agreement soon. I'm proposing 54/46 split in my favor. This is a fair deal considering the rapid devaluation we both face.  Let's be reasonable and close this out.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  Each round diminishes the value of the money.  It's crucial to reach a deal quickly.
* **Devaluation Advantage:** Alice loses value at twice my rate.  This gives me leverage to push for a slightly better deal than a perfect split.
* **Compromise (Slightly):** I'm moving closer to a middle ground from my previous offer to show a willingness to negotiate. This might encourage Alice to accept before the money loses even more value."
