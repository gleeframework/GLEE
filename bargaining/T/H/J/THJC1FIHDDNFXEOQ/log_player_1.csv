"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  This takes into account the potential for inflation and gives you a fair share.  Accept and we both get something, or risk losing more in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
