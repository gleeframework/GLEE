"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 30 dollars, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept it and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I can do better than that! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 90% of what it was in the first round. I'm not too thrilled about the 20 dollars, but I don't want to risk going to the next round. I'll accept the offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
