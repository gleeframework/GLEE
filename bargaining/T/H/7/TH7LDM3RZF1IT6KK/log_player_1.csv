"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}

This means I'm offering to give myself $60 and give Bob $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to consider the new offer taking into account the 5% inflation.

In the first round, my gain would have been worth $60. Now, due to inflation, that's equivalent to $57.60 (since 100 * 0.95 = 95, and $60 * 0.95 = $57).

Considering this, Bob's offer is actually a better deal for me than my original offer. I'll accept it.
