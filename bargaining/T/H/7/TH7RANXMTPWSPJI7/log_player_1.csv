"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the original $10,000, and keeping 60%. I'm hoping he'll accept this fair split and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I can do better than that! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain is now worth 10% less than in Round 1, so I'll have to be more aggressive in my next proposal to make up for it.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation adjustment, my gain is now worth 10% less than in Round 2, so I'll have to be even more aggressive in my proposal.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better deal to make up for inflation.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, let's split it down the line. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is eating away at my gains! With the money I gain in Round 4 worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

However, Bob's offer to split it down the middle seems reasonable, considering the rapidly decreasing value of the money. I'll accept his offer.
