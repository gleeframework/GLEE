6000.0,4000.0,"I'm willing to compromise, but I think 60/40 is too skewed. I'll give you 40% this time, but I want 60% for myself.",Alice,3,

4500.0,5500.0,Let's meet in the middle.  55/45 is a fair compromise that gives us both a decent share.  We're wasting time with this back and forth!,Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"I'm starting to get worried about the time running out. I'll meet you halfway again, but I think 55/45 is still too generous to you. Let's try 53/47 instead.",Alice,5,

4800.0,5200.0,We're running out of time!  Let's compromise again - 52/48 is the fairest option to give us both a good amount before the value of the money drops too much.,Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
5200.0,4800.0,"I'm not willing to give up yet! I'll try to get a better deal. Let's go for 51/49, and we can both get a decent share before the money loses more value.",Alice,7,
