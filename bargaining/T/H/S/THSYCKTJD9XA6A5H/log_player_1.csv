"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
I'll start by offering Bob a small amount, hoping he'll accept it to avoid any further rounds and potential loss for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I accept the offer. Even with the 5% inflation, getting half of the money is a better outcome for me than potentially losing even more in further rounds."
