"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer to get the game started."

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","In round 2, the money is worth less due to inflation, and Bob's offer is even more skewed towards him. I'll have to think carefully about this one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can do better than 30% of the remaining money. I'll try to negotiate further to get a more favorable deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation reducing the value of the money, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a better deal.

  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42/58 split, trying to take a bit more than Bob's previous offer, while still leaving him with a decent share."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly due to inflation. I need to be careful not to give away too much.
