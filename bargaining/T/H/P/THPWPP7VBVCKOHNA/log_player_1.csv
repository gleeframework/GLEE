Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was quite generous, but I think we can find a more balanced agreement. How about a 70/30 split in my favor? This round presents a good opportunity for you to secure a significant sum. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
