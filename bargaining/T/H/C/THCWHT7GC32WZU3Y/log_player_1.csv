"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a fairly aggressive offer, keeping 90% of the money for myself. Since this is the first round, I want to see if Bob is willing to accept a lopsided deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer is the best course of action.  I'm getting a significant portion of the money, and the inflation means any further rounds will likely result in a smaller payout for me."
