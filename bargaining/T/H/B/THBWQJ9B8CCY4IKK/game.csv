,,,Alice,4,reject
50.0,50.0,"Bob, it's clear we both want a good deal, but this back and forth isn't helping. The value for me is decreasing rapidly. A 50/50 split is the fairest option at this point.",Alice,5,

30.0,70.0,"Given the significant decrease in value for you due to inflation, I'm willing to take a larger share, but still offer you a considerable amount.",Bob,6,
