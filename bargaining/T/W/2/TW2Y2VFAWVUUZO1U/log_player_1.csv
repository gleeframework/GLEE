Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a strong offer to secure the majority of the money. Since the value of my share decreases each round, I need to maximize my gains early on.  Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more money, the inflation factor is significant. Accepting this offer guarantees me at least $5,000, which is better than risking a smaller share in the next round."
