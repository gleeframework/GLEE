Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. We're both losing out because of the inflation. Let's just split it evenly and be done with it. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Alice's offer is reasonable, and with each round, the value of the money I gain is decreasing significantly. I'm not likely to get a better deal than this.  Let's end it here."
