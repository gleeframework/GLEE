"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money fairly. I propose we divide it into 60-40. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm going to try and get a better deal. There's no inflation yet, so I have nothing to lose by rejecting and making a counter offer.  Let's see if Alice is willing to negotiate!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, but I think 60-40 is a fairer split. Let's see if we can agree on this.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I've adjusted our proposal to 54-46. Let's try to find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 460000 
# Alice gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Alice's offer is better than her previous one, I'm still not satisfied. I'm confident that I can get a better deal, especially since inflation is starting to affect Alice's gains.  I'll try to push for a more even split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Inflation is starting to bite, so let's be realistic. 55-45 feels like a fair compromise, considering the circumstances.  Let's close this deal.""}
