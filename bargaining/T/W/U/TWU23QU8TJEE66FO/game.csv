400000.0,600000.0,"I think a 60/40 split is more fair, given that we both need to consider the diminishing value of the money with each passing round.  Accept this and we can both walk away with a significant portion of the prize.",Bob,2,

800000.0,200000.0,"I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I still need to get the majority of the money. This offer is fair considering the inflation we're facing. Accept it and we can both move on.  Reject it, and we'll see how much this game truly diminishes our potential gains.",Alice,3,

500000.0,500000.0,"Let's be reasonable.  The money is losing value rapidly.  A 50/50 split is the fairest way to divide this before we're both left with a pittance.  Accept this offer, and we can both walk away with a significant amount of money.  Reject it, and we'll both have to deal with the consequences of our stubbornness.",Bob,4,
