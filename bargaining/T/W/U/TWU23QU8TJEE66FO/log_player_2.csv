Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I take the lion's share, but you still get a decent chunk. Accept and we both walk away with something. Reject and we'll see how this game plays out.

# Alice gain: 900000

Let's see what happens if I get to make a proposal."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is more fair, given that we both need to consider the diminishing value of the money with each passing round.  Accept this and we can both walk away with a significant portion of the prize.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I still need to get the majority of the money. This offer is fair considering the inflation we're facing. Accept it and we can both move on.  Reject it, and we'll see how much this game truly diminishes our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is still not fair given the inflation we're experiencing. I'm confident that I can get a better deal for myself in the next round."

Reject it, and we'll both have to deal with the consequences of our stubbornness.""}
