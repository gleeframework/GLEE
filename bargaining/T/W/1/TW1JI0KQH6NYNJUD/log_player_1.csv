"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 40 dollars, and I'll take 60 dollars. Let's see if you can do better.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a relatively fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, given that we both have equal power in this negotiation. Let's end this on a good note. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob wants to stick with the 60-40 split, but this time with a slightly better deal for me due to the inflation.

I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure I'm ready to accept this offer yet. I'd like to see if I can do better. The fact that Bob is suggesting the same split as before, but with a slightly better deal for me due to inflation, makes me think he might be willing to give more. I'd like to make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 20% less than in the first round, my offer will be slightly smaller. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm not convinced by your offer. I think I deserve a bit more, considering the risks and uncertainties of this negotiation. I'll give you 55 dollars, and I'll take 45 dollars. Can you do better?""
}
```

I'm increasing my share by 5 dollars, and reducing Bob's share by 5 dollars. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer or make a counteroffer!"
