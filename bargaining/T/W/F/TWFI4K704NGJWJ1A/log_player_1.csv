"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}

I'm offering a 50-50 split, hoping to get a quick agreement!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already biting!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, I'd rather not accept an offer that gives me less than I would have gotten in the previous round.

I'll reject this offer and wait for the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Time for a new proposal! Considering the inflation, I'll try to get a bigger share this time.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}

I'm offering a slightly weighted split, hoping to get a better deal this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering the significant drop in value of the money I'd gain, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. However, I don't want to give up too much more ground, especially since the money Bob gains is still worth the same as in the previous round.

I'll accept this offer, hoping it's the best I can get at this point.
