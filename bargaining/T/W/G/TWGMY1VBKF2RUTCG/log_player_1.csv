"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

In the first round, my offer was 600,000, which was worth 60% of the initial amount. Now, with the same offer, it's worth 60% of the remaining amount after Bob's offer, which is 400,000.

So, I'll accept Bob's offer.
