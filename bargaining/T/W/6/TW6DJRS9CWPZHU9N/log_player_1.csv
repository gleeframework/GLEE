Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a very greedy approach. It's unlikely Bob will accept this, but it sets the stage for future rounds. Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to keep more, Bob's offer is fair and I don't want to risk getting nothing in the later rounds due to inflation."
