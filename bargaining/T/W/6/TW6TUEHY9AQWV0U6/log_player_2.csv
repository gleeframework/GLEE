"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a simple and fair split, Bob. 60/40 seems reasonable. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I appreciate your fairness in the first round, Alice. However, I believe a 60/40 split in my favor is more equitable, considering the potential for inflation in later rounds. Let's see what you think.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your point, but letting inflation dictate the terms isn't fair. How about a compromise - 55/45? 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
