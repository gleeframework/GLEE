"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40. This is a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, let's take a bit more! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation, my $60 is now worth $48.

Considering Bob's new offer, I think he's being a bit too greedy. I'd rather not give him 70% of the remaining value.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my offer needs to be adjusted to account for the decreased value of the money. I'll propose a new offer that takes into account the 20% reduction in value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 36,
  ""bob_gain"": 64,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

In this offer, I'm proposing a 36-64 split, which is a more modest increase from my previous offer. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'll take the majority! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money! My $60 is now worth $30.80, and with the 48.8% reduction, it's even lower than that.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'm not thrilled about giving him 80% of the remaining value. I'd rather not be left with almost nothing.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly due to inflation. My previous offer of $36 is now worth $18.72.

I'll make a new offer that takes into account the current value of the money. I'll propose a smaller share for myself to try to salvage what's left.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 12,
  ""bob_gain"": 88,
  ""message"": ""I'm running out of options, Bob!""
}
```

This offer is a 12-88 split, which is a significant concession on my part. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're really running out of time, Alice... 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll on the value of the money. My previous offer of $12 is now worth $4.00, and with the 67.23% reduction, it's even lower than that.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'm not thrilled about giving him 90% of the remaining value. I'd rather not be left with almost nothing.

However, I'm running out of options and the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. I'll have to accept this offer to avoid losing everything.
