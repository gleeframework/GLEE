"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more since you lose value each round 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is getting worse for me. While I am losing value due to inflation, I should hold out for a more reasonable split. It's better to take my chances making an offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""This is my final offer: a perfectly even split. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Time Pressure:** With each round, the inflation eats away at my potential gains.  I need to settle this quickly.
* **Fairness:**  A 50/50 split is objectively fair. Bob has no grounds to argue for more, especially since he doesn't face inflation.
* **Strong Stance:**  By calling it my ""final offer,"" I'm putting pressure on Bob to accept. He knows I'm serious and won't accept anything less. If he rejects this, he risks getting a worse deal in subsequent rounds."
