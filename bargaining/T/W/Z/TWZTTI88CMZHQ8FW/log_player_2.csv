"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we split the money 90/10. I'll take 900k, and you can have 100k. I think it's a fair starting point, and we can always adjust it in the next rounds. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible offer for Bob!  We'll get a much better deal if we hold out."

Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway on the split. Let's go 60/40, with me getting 600k. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the inflation we're facing. Let's end this game on a good note. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is trying to scare me with inflation, but she's the one feeling it most! We're still in the early rounds. I'm confident I can get a better deal than this."
