"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $400,000 and keep $600,000 for myself. My message to Bob is ""Let's be fair"" to try to convince him that this is a reasonable division."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn to propose a fair deal. This considers the time value of money. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Although the money is worth 5% less in this round, I think I can get a better deal in the next round. Bob's offer of $475,000 is less than what I initially offered him, so I'm not convinced that this is a fair deal. I'll proceed to the next round and make a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll offer Bob $450,000 and keep $550,000 for myself. My message to Bob is ""Considering inflation"" to acknowledge that the money is worth less in this round, but still trying to get a slightly better deal than what Bob offered in the previous round.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer, Alice. Let's end this before inflation eats away at the value. 
# Alice gain: 487500 
# Bob gain: 512500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll accept Bob's offer. Considering the significant decrease in value due to inflation (14.26% less than the initial amount), I think it's wise to accept this offer and end the game. The difference between our proposed amounts is relatively small, and further rounds will only lead to more loss of value. Bob's message also implies that he's willing to walk away if I reject this offer, so I'll take the safe route and accept.
