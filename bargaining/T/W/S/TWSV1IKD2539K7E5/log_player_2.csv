Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The value is decreasing with each round, Bob. This is a better offer than your last one, and ensures we both benefit. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI think I can still get a better deal, despite the inflation."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. This offer ensures we both get a reasonable share before inflation eats away at the value. It's a fair deal. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nGiven the rate of inflation affecting both of us, but Alice more significantly, this 50/50 split seems like the most reasonable offer I'll get. Further rounds will only decrease the value of our gains, and this way, we both get an equal share. It's time to accept and walk away with something rather than risking further devaluation."
