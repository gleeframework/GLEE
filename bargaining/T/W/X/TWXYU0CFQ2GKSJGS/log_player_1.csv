Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a fairly generous offer to Bob.  I'm hoping to secure a deal quickly, as the inflation will hurt me more than Bob in the later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more, accepting this offer is the best strategy. Bob's offer gives me 75% of the remaining value, and I have no way of knowing if I'll be able to get more in future rounds. The inflation is working against me, so it's better to take what I can get now."
