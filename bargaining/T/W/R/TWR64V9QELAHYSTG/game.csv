999000.0,1000.0,Let's start with a fair split.  I'll take 99.9% and you get 0.1%.  We can adjust as we go.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
1000.0,999000.0,"I think a 99.9/0.1 split is more fair, with me getting the larger share this time.  Let's see if you agree.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
999000.0,1000.0,"Let's stick with the original split - 99.9% for me, 0.1% for you.  Inflation is a factor, but we can't let it completely dictate our decision.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
10000.0,990000.0,"I'm willing to offer you 10000 this round, but I'm still holding out for a larger share.  Let's see if we can come to a more equitable agreement.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
990000.0,10000.0,"Let's compromise. I'll take 99% and you get 1%.  This is still a significant gain for you, and it leaves us both with a reasonable share.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
100000.0,900000.0,"I'm proposing a more balanced split this time, with me taking 90% and you receiving 10%. This is a significant increase for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise given the inflation we're both facing.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
950000.0,50000.0,"I'm willing to give you a bigger share, 5% this time, but I need to secure the majority. Let's try to make progress before the inflation really bites into our potential gains.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
200000.0,800000.0,"I'm offering 80% to me, 20% to you. We're getting closer to a fair split. It's time to be reasonable.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
800000.0,200000.0,"I'm going to offer you 20% this time, but we need to settle soon, the inflation is affecting both of us now.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
300000.0,700000.0,"We're getting closer.  I'm offering you 30% this round, but if we don't agree soon, we'll both lose a lot more due to inflation.",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
700000.0,300000.0,"This is my final offer.  It's the best we can do with so little time left.  Accept and we both get something, or we both get nothing.",Alice,11,
