,,,Bob,1,reject
350000.0,650000.0,That's heavily skewed Alice. I'm proposing a more balanced 65/35 split.  Let's be reasonable - time is money!,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
600000.0,400000.0,I'm willing to compromise. Let's do a 60/40 split this time. It's a better deal for both of us than the previous offers.,Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
320000.0,680000.0,"Alice, the clock is ticking and your deal is getting worse with every round. I'm offering 68/32.  Take it or leave it!",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
500000.0,500000.0,This isn't a game for me to lose. We both stand to lose if we don't reach a deal. Let's split it evenly.  50/50. This is the last compromise I'm willing to make.,Alice,5,
