Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger share to make this worthwhile. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, accepting now would still give her a significantly larger share.  The impact of inflation is increasing, but it's still worth holding out for a better deal for a couple more rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm aiming for a fair deal. This offer reflects the time pressure and gives us both a good share. Let's close this out.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** This offer shows a willingness to compromise from Bob's previous offer of 60/40. 
* **Urgency:** The message emphasizes the time pressure and the decreasing value of the money due to inflation.
* **Balance:**  A 45/55 split, while favoring Alice slightly, might be tempting enough for her to accept, considering the shrinking pot."
