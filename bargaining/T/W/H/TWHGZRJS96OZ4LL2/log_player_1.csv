"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Accept and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20$ and keeping 80$ for myself. The message is a friendly nudge to see if Bob will accept the offer and end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split this fairly. I'm willing to give you a good deal. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain is now worth 20% less than in the first round. Considering Bob's offer, I'll think for a moment...

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that 40$ is a good deal for me, especially considering the reduced value due to inflation. I'd like to make my own proposal for Round 3."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's end this!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40$ and keeping 60$ for myself, trying to meet him in the middle. The message is a friendly suggestion to end the game with a fair split."
