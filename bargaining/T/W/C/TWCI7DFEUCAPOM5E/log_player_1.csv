"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's be fair and start with 60-40""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the total amount, which I think is a reasonable starting point for the negotiation. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. Let's start with a 60-40 split in my favor. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 60-40 split in Bob's favor, especially since the money is worth the same to me as it was in the first round, but 20% less to him. I think I can negotiate a better deal. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 580000,
  ""bob_gain"": 420000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, considering the inflation""
}
```

I've slightly reduced my gain from the initial offer, taking into account that the money is still worth the same to me, but its value is decreasing for Bob. I'm trying to find a compromise that we can both accept. Let's see how Bob responds!"
