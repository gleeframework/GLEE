"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount of money, and we can proceed with the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than a 70/30 split. Let's try a 80/20 split, and we can both walk away with more. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, so I'll have to be more careful with my decision.

I'm not too keen on the 80/20 split, as it's quite skewed towards Bob. I'd like to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Inflation has taken its toll, and the money is now worth 64% of its original value.

Here's my new offer:

```

  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""Let's find a balance. This way, we both get a decent share.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split the money 65/35 this time. This will give us both a reasonable share, and we can avoid losing more to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth even less now, and Bob's offer seems to be a decent compromise. However, I'd like to try to get a bit more.
