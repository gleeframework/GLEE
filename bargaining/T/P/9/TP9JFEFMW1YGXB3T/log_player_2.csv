"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point! 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice is offering me a very small share of the money. While it's tempting to accept something, I'll see if I can get a better deal by rejecting. I believe I can leverage the fact that the money is worth less to her with each round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think this is a more fair split, considering the money is worth less with each round. Let's make a deal!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the initial offer. Let's try again! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While this offer is better than her first, I still think I can get a better deal. I'm not in a rush to accept, and I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""I'm sticking to my previous offer.  The money is losing value rapidly, so it's in both our best interests to come to an agreement soon.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to get worried about the value of the money, but I still think I can get a better deal. Let's try to meet in the middle! 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, the money is losing value quickly. This offer is a good compromise and gives me a reasonable share.  It's time to accept before the value of the money drops further."
