"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to start."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since I'm getting a smaller share, I'll have to consider whether it's worth accepting now or waiting for a better offer.

I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a new proposal. Since Bob offered me 40% in the previous round, I'll try to increase my share a bit. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering the offer, I think I'll accept this one. It's not the best I've seen, but it's better than waiting and risking getting a worse offer in the next round.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
