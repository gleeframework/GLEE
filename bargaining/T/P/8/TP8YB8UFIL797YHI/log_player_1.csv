"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40. I think we can both live with that.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $10,000, leaving Bob with 40%. I'm framing it as a fair split, but also leaving room for Bob to negotiate if he wants to try for a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 55/45 is a fairer split, considering the inflation. Let's make this quick and move on. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation factor, I'm not sure I'm comfortable with Bob's proposed split. I think I can do better than 45%. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure 45% is enough for me, considering the inflation. I'm willing to negotiate further.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation factor, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the initial offer was 60-40. This is my final offer.""
}
```"
