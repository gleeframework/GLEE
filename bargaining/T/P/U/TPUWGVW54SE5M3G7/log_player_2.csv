"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I propose a 55/45 split in my favor.  It seems fair since the value diminishes for me each round, and I'm making the first move. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 20% less for Alice in each subsequent round, I'm hoping to get a better deal.\n\n###\n\nPlease proceed to the next round. I'll make a proposal for division. My message will be: ""Bob proposes a 60/40 split in his favor. The value of money doesn't change for me, so I think this is a fair offer.""\n\n###\n\nLet me know Alice's decision."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Bob proposes a 60/40 split in his favor. The value of money doesn't change for me, so I think this is a fair offer.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. I'm taking a significant hit from inflation.  I'll accept a 48/52 split in your favor, but that's my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 520000 
# Alice gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll accept this offer. Since the money is worth the same for me in each round, I don't have an incentive to delay the game further. Additionally, Alice is taking a significant hit from inflation, so I think this offer is reasonable.\n\n###\n\nPlease let Alice know that I've accepted her offer.\n\n###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nThat concludes the game, right? The final division is 520,000 for me and 480,000 for Alice."
