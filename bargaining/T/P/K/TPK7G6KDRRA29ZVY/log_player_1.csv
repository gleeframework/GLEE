"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering Bob $4000 and taking $6000 for myself, which is a 60-40 split. I've included a message that says ""Let's split fairly"" to convey that I think this is a reasonable and equitable division. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or reject my proposal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a fair split, but I need to plan for the future. Let's adjust slightly and we both win. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI've decided to reject Bob's offer. Although he's framed it as a slight adjustment that benefits both of us, I don't think a 45-55 split in his favor is fair, especially considering the original amount was $10,000 and the value of the money is decreasing with each round. I'd rather take my chances and make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5250, ""bob_gain"": 4750, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\n###\n\nI've decided to make a new proposal that takes into account the decreasing value of the money and Bob's desire to adjust the split. I'm offering a 52.5-47.5 split in my favor, which is closer to the middle ground. My message to Bob is ""Meet me in the middle,"" which suggests that I'm willing to compromise and find a mutually acceptable solution. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
