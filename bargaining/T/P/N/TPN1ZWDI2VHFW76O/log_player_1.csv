"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and straightforward offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have 300k, but I'll get the bigger share! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","That's a bold move by Bob!

I'll think carefully before responding...

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is biting, and the money is worth 90% of what it was in the first round. I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""bob_gain"": 600000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly bigger share this time, but don't get too excited!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still keeping a significant portion for myself. Let's see if he'll take it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have a tiny share, but I'm taking the lion's share! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob's being aggressive!

I'm not thrilled about the tiny share, but I don't want to risk going into the next round with even less value. I'll take the offer, hoping to negotiate better in future rounds.
