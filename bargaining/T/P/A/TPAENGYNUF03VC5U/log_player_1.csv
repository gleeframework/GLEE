"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose that Alice receives $900,000 and Bob receives $100,000. 

This is a good starting point, as it gives Bob a small but significant amount to consider while still leaving the majority for me. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is still unfair, and the inflation is only making it worse. I will reject and wait for my turn."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

I propose that Alice receives $550,000 and Bob receives $450,000. 

After Bob's unfair proposal, I need to ensure I get a more balanced share.  This offer still gives Bob a substantial amount, but it reflects a fairer split considering the diminishing value of the money. Let's see how he responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is becoming increasingly unfair with each passing round. I will reject it and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round. The value of the money is rapidly declining, but I will not settle for such a lopsided distribution."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I propose that Alice receives $600,000 and Bob receives $400,000.

This offer still gives Bob a significant share, but it reflects a fairer split considering the declining value of the money.  I'm willing to increase my share slightly, but I need to see if Bob is willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly in his favor, and the inflation is eating away at the value of the money. I will not accept this and will try to negotiate a better deal in the next round. I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not going to be exploited by Bob's greed."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}
```

I propose that Alice receives $650,000 and Bob receives $350,000.

Given the declining value of the money, I've adjusted my offer slightly to reflect a fairer split. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to see if Bob is finally willing to acknowledge the diminishing value of the money and the need for a more equitable distribution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still not fair, and the inflation continues to eat away at the value of the money. I will not accept this offer and will try to negotiate a better deal in the next round. I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not going to let Bob take advantage of the situation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I propose that Alice receives $700,000 and Bob receives $300,000.

This offer reflects a fairer split considering the declining value of the money and the continued unfairness of Bob's proposals. I'm willing to compromise and increase my share slightly, but I need to see if Bob is finally willing to accept a reasonable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I still believe a slightly larger share for myself would be fairer, considering the significant inflation and the likelihood of further rejections leading to even lower payouts, accepting a 50/50 split is the most practical choice. It secures a reasonable amount for me and avoids the risk of further losses due to inflation."
