"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and square!""
}
```

This way, we both get $50, and we can end the game if Bob agrees."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the lead, you can't resist my offer! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that I ""can't resist"" his offer, and I think I can do better than 30% of the original amount!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Time to make a counteroffer!

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""You're trying to take the lead, but I'm not backing down!""
}
```

I'm willing to give Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm not giving up yet!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'm taking control! 
# Alice gain: 25 
# Bob gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is taking a toll!

I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to give up control just yet, and 25% of the original amount is still too low for me. I'll keep negotiating!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Time to make another counteroffer!

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,

}
```

I'm willing to give Bob a bigger share, but I'm still holding out for a better deal."
