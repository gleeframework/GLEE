"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my initial offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```
I'm offering to take 60% of the money, leaving Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","My offer from the previous round is no longer on the table, and now I have to decide on Bob's offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, I need to consider the actual value of the amount I'll receive.

The actual value of my gain would be 40 * 0.95 = 38.

I'll accept Bob's offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
