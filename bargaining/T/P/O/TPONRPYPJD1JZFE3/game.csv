30.0,70.0,"I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm still not willing to give away 60% of the money. I'm trying to find a balance between fairness and getting a decent amount myself.",Bob,4,

45.0,55.0,"I'm willing to compromise.  I think 45/55 is a reasonable split, giving you a bigger share but not completely taking advantage of the inflation situation. Let's try to reach a solution before we both lose out on even more money.",Alice,5,
