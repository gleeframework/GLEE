Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'll start by offering a large portion to myself, as I have the advantage of knowing the inflation will affect Bob more.  Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being greedy!  He's offering me a much smaller percentage and still taking the lion's share. I'll reject this offer and see if he'll budge in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

I'm going to try a more balanced approach this time.  Since inflation is hitting Bob harder, I'll offer a slightly larger share to him, hoping to incentivize him to accept before it gets even worse for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This offer is much better than the last one, and Bob's gains are probably significantly reduced by inflation. I'll take it before it gets worse for me."
