I'm proposing a 51/49 split in my favor. It's a fair starting point, and if Bob rejects, we'll have to deal with the money being worth less in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting. While this offer is slightly more in my favor than my initial offer, the inflation means that the actual value of the money is less. I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split. After two rounds of inflation, it's clear that the longer we play, the less money we'll both get. This offer guarantees a fair division of the remaining value, and it's the most rational move at this point."
