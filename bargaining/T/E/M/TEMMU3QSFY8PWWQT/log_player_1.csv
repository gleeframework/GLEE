I'm going to offer Bob $100,000 and keep $900,000 for myself.  It's a pretty generous offer, and I think he'll accept it.  It's a lot better than getting nothing in 12 rounds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I'd prefer more, it's getting late and I don't want to risk getting nothing.  It's a fair split, and I'm willing to accept it."
