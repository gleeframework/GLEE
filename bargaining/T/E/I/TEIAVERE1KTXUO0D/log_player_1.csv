"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me the majority of the initial $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation affecting Bob's gain, I'll think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 10% less, I'll consider this a more favorable offer for me.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
