"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting strong, let's see if you can keep it up! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 0% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since Bob's offer is 700,000$ for me, but it's worth 20% less than the 1,000,000$ in the first round, it's equivalent to 560,000$. This is less than my initial offer of 600,000$, so I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 700,000$ for me, I'll try to make an even better offer. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You upped the ante, now it's my turn to counter""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 450,000$ and keeping 550,000$ for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I'm not falling for it! 
# Alice gain: 370000 
# Bob gain: 630000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 0% less for me and 48.8% less for Bob, I'll calculate the equivalent value of Bob's offer.

The original 1,000,000$ is worth 100% for me and 100% for Bob in the first round. After 3 rounds of inflation, Bob's offer of 630,000$ is worth 51.2% of the original amount (100% - 48.8%). 

So, the equivalent value of Bob's offer is 51.2% of 1,000,000$, which is 512,000$. This is more than my previous offer of 550,000$, so I'll accept this offer.
