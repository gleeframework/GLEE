"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money evenly to start, and then we can negotiate further if needed.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to begin with, hoping to set a fair foundation for further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share this round, but still leaving you with a decent amount. Let's see if you can do better next time! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my potential gain, I need to be more cautious. However, Bob's offer is still quite generous, and I don't want to risk going into the next round with a significantly reduced amount.

I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
