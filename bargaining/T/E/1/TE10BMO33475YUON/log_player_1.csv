"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take $6,000 and you can take $4,000. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. What do you think, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting too high, I'll give you a lower offer. Consider this one. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my $6,000 is now worth less, but I'm not sure how much less Bob's offer is worth to me.

I'll have to think carefully about this one. Considering the 5% decrease in value of my potential gain, I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. My initial instinct is to reject it and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60% in his favor, I'll try to adjust my offer to be more favorable to myself. I'll offer a smaller amount to Bob, but still try to be reasonable.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. I'll take $4,500 and you can take $5,500. Is this more acceptable to you?""
}
