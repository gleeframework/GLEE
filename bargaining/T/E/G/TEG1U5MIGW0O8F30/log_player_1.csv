I'm going to start with a very generous offer to Bob. This gives me a strong starting position, and hopefully, he'll accept it in the first round.  If he doesn't, I'll still have a lot of rounds to negotiate.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being a bit greedy, but I'm not going to give in so easily.  It's still early in the game, and I can still get a good deal. I'm going to reject his offer and see if he'll come down in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer slightly, but still give Bob a decent amount. I'm hoping he'll see that I'm serious about getting a good deal, but I'm also willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is getting increasingly bold, but I'm not going to give in to his demands. His offer is getting worse with each round, and I'm sure he'll realize that he needs to compromise soon.  I'm going to reject this offer and see what he does next."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway with this offer.  We both have a good chance of getting a decent share of the money, and I'm hoping he'll recognize that it's a fair deal considering how much inflation has eaten into the value of the money.  I'm also hoping that the pressure of the dwindling rounds will lead him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is really pushing his luck now. This offer is worse than his last one, and I'm not going to let him take advantage of me. I'm going to keep rejecting his offers until he realizes that he needs to be more reasonable.  There are still a few rounds left, and I'm not giving up."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

The time for compromise is here. Bob is being stubborn, but I need to secure at least some of the money. This offer gives us an even split, and while it's not ideal, it's the best chance we have of not losing everything to inflation."
