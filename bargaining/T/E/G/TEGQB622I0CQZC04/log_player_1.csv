"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I'm offering you $400,000, and I'll take the remaining $600,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more careful with the inflation!

In this round, I'll gain $400,000, but its value is 10% less than in the previous round. So, I'll have to think carefully about whether to accept this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In round 3, the money is worth 20% less than in the first round. Since I'm the proposer this time, I'll make a new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm offering you $450,000, and I'll take the remaining $550,000."
