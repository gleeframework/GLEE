"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, I think this is a good starting point 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While a fair split might seem appealing, I'm going to reject this offer. The inflation factor means that waiting to make my own proposal could result in a better outcome for me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is a fair compromise, considering the potential for inflation. Let's end this on a good note.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I should get a bit more considering the initial 4:1 ratio I proposed. This way, we both get a decent share 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, Alice's offer is a significant improvement from the previous round.  The inflation factor has reduced the value of the money, so accepting a decent share is better than risking further devaluation by continuing to reject offers."
