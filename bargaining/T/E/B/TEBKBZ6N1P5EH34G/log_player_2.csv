"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","### Step 1: Understand the game's current state
We are in Round 2 of the game. Alice proposed a division in Round 1, offering $40 to Bob and $60 to herself, with the message ""Let's split fairly."" Bob rejected this offer.

### Step 2: Determine the strategy for Round 2
Given that Bob rejected Alice's offer, it's now Bob's turn to make a proposal. A strategic approach for Bob could be to offer a division that is slightly more favorable to himself than Alice's original offer but still appears fair or reasonable enough that Alice might consider accepting it, rather than risking a worse outcome in subsequent rounds.

### Step 3: Decide on the offer
Considering the strategy, Bob could offer himself $55 and Alice $45. This division gives Bob more than Alice's original offer but doesn't so heavily favor Bob that Alice would outright reject it without consideration.

### Step 4: Craft the message
The message should be concise and encourage Alice to accept the offer. It could be something like, ""A bit more for me, still fair.""

### Step 5: Format the offer and message in JSON
Following the game's instructions, Bob's offer and message should be formatted in JSON as follows:

{""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""A bit more for me, still fair.""}

The final answer is: {""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""A bit more for me, still fair.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet in the middle? 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","### Step 1: Understand the current state of the game
We are in Round 4 of the game. In Round 3, Alice proposed a division of $42 for Bob and $58 for herself, with the message ""Meet in the middle?"" Bob rejected this offer.

### Step 2: Determine the strategy for Round 4
Given that Bob rejected Alice's offer, which was slightly more favorable to Bob than her original offer but still not as favorable as Bob's offer in Round 2, Bob needs to consider how to make an attractive offer that Alice might accept. Since Alice proposed meeting in the middle and Bob rejected it, Bob's next offer should be strategic, taking into account the risk that if Alice rejects it, the game could continue indefinitely or Alice could make an even less favorable offer next time.

### Step 3: Decide on the offer
Considering the strategy and the fact that Alice's last offer was $42 for Bob and $58 for herself, Bob might consider making an offer that is slightly more favorable to Alice than his previous one but still aims to maximize his gain. Bob could offer $52 for himself and $48 for Alice, aiming to appear more compromising while still favoring himself slightly more than Alice's last offer.

### Step 4: Craft the message
The message should convey a sense of compromise and encourage Alice to accept. It could be something like, ""Narrowing the gap.""

### Step 5: Format the offer and message in JSON
Following the game's instructions, Bob's offer and message should be formatted in JSON as follows:

{""bob_gain"": 52,
""alice_gain"": 48,
""message"": ""Narrowing the gap.""}

The final answer is: {""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Narrowing the gap.""}"

Round 5

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","### Step 1: Assess the current state of the game
We are in Round 6 of the game. Alice's last offer was $43 for Bob and $57 for herself, with the message ""Getting closer?"" Bob rejected this offer.

### Step 2: Determine the strategy for Round 6
Considering the pattern of offers and rejections, it's clear that both players are trying to maximize their gain while appearing to compromise. Since Bob has rejected Alice's incremental increases, Bob's next offer should aim to find a middle ground that is slightly more favorable to Alice than his previous offers but still advantageous to himself.

### Step 3: Decide on the offer
Given the history of offers, Bob might consider meeting Alice halfway between her last offer and his last offer. However, to maintain a strategic advantage, Bob could offer $51 for himself and $49 for Alice. This offer is closer to Alice's last offer than Bob's previous one, indicating a willingness to compromise while still favoring himself.

### Step 4: Craft the message
The message should reflect the compromise and encourage Alice to accept. It could be something like, ""Almost there, let's settle.""

### Step 5: Format the offer and message in JSON
Following the game's instructions, Bob's offer and message should be formatted in JSON as follows:

{""bob_gain"": 51,
""alice_gain"": 49,
""message"": ""Almost there, let's settle.""}

The final answer is: {""bob_gain"": 51, ""alice_gain"": 49, ""message"": ""Almost there, let's settle.""}"

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Last chance for more? 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","### Step 1: Evaluate the current state of the game
We are in Round 7 of the game. Alice's offer is $44 for Bob and $56 for herself, with the message ""Last chance for more?"" This implies that Alice is suggesting this might be the last offer before she stops increasing the amount offered to Bob.

### Step 2: Assess the offer in the context of the game's progression
Throughout the game, Bob has been trying to maximize his gain, and Alice has been incrementally increasing her offers to Bob. This offer of $44 is the highest Alice has made so far.

### Step 3: Consider the potential outcomes of accepting or rejecting the offer
If Bob accepts this offer, he gains $44, which is more than any previous offer from Alice. If Bob rejects this offer, he risks Alice making a less favorable offer in the next round or the game potentially ending with no agreement, resulting in both players receiving nothing.

### Step 4: Decide on the action to take
Given the incremental increases in Alice's offers and the risk of rejecting this offer, accepting $44 seems like the most rational decision at this point in the game. It maximizes Bob's gain based on the offers made so far and avoids the risk of ending the game with no agreement.

### Step 5: Format the decision in JSON
Following the game's instructions, Bob's decision should be formatted in JSON as follows:

{""decision"": ""accept""}

The final answer is: {""decision"": ""accept""}"
