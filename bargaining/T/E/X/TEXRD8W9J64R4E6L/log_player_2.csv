Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, the value is decreasing for us both. Let's settle this now. This offer is reasonable. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer.  The value is depreciating rapidly with each round. Let's wrap this up.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting us nowhere. I'm offering a compromise. Let's end this before the value diminishes further. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, accepting is the most logical choice for Bob. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  The value of the money is significantly decreasing for Bob with each round. Accepting $40 now is better than risking getting an even lower amount in subsequent rounds.
* **Alice's Likely Strategy:** Alice is likely aware of Bob's disadvantage with the inflation mechanic. She's likely to keep pushing for a larger share knowing Bob's position weakens over time.
* **Certainty vs. Risk:** Accepting a less-than-ideal offer now provides Bob with some guaranteed value. Rejecting and hoping for a better offer in the future is extremely risky given the game's setup."
