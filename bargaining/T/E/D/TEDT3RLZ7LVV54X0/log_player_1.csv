"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor. I figure I'm taking the risk of being the first proposer, so I'll go for a larger share. Let's see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

It's better to take the 5000 now than risk losing even more in future rounds. It's not ideal, but it's a fair split considering the inflation and Bob's willingness to compromise."
