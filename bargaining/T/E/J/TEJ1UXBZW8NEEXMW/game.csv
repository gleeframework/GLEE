250000.0,750000.0,"I propose we split the money 75/25 in my favor. While I understand the importance of fairness, I believe this split accounts for the potential devaluation of the money due to inflation in the coming rounds. This ensures we both get a decent share before the money loses too much value.",Bob,2,

600000.0,400000.0,I propose a division where I receive $600000 and Bob gets $400000. This maintains a reasonable balance while accounting for the risk of inflation. I believe this is a fair compromise.,Alice,3,
