Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split the money 75/25 in my favor. While I understand the importance of fairness, I believe this split accounts for the potential devaluation of the money due to inflation in the coming rounds. This ensures we both get a decent share before the money loses too much value. 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
