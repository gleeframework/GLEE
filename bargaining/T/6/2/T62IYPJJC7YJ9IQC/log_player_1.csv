"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 7:3, seems fair to me""
}
```

I'm proposing a 7:3 split in my favor, which is a generous offer considering I'll get the larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script. 700k for me, 300k for you.  Seems fair, right? 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it for a moment...

Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, the actual amounts are:

* Bob's offer: 280,000 for me, 700,000 for Bob

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but it's a decent compromise. I'll accept it.
