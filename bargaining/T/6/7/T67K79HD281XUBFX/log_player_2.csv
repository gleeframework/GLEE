Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see if we can get a better deal."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's try 55/45. I think it's more fair than 60/40. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Let's take it, a 45/55 split is better than going another round and risking getting nothing."
