"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This seems like a fair split to start with. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 40, ""alice_gain"": 60, ""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, Alice, but my offer is more equitable.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's find a compromise. This offer is a bit closer to the middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""Time is running out, Alice. This is my final offer.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close to the wire.  This offer is a compromise, considering the time pressure. 
# Bob gain: 38 
# Alice gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the pressure is on, accepting this offer would mean losing out on a significant chunk of the initial value due to inflation.  There's still a chance to negotiate a better deal, even if it means taking a risk in later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 42, ""alice_gain"": 58, ""message"": ""Alice, this is a serious offer.  Let's settle this fairly before inflation eats away at the value any further.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a fair offer, especially considering the inflation.  Let's settle this now and both walk away with something. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:** The game has reached a critical point.  While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer of $40 is better than risking getting nothing in later rounds. The impact of inflation is becoming too significant to ignore, and further negotiation might lead to an even worse outcome for me."
