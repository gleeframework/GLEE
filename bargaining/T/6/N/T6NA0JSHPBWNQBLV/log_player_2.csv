"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money fairly, Bob. I think this is a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Let's see how Alice reacts to a counter-offer. While her offer seems ""fair"" on the surface, the inflation heavily favors me in later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm aiming for a slightly better outcome for myself. How about this?""}
``` 

This offer still gives Alice the bigger piece of the pie, but it moves closer to a 50/50 split. This signals that I'm not going to simply accept a heavily weighted offer in her favor.  The relatively small increase also aims to avoid antagonizing Alice too early in the negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's meet in the middle. This offer considers the inflation we're facing. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the faster inflation on my side.  A 42/58 split might have been tempting in Round 1, but it's not good enough now.  Let's see if she's willing to move further."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, time is running out. A 50/50 split seems like the fairest option considering the circumstances.  Let's settle this.""}
```

This is a strong play.  We're now past the halfway point of the rounds, and Alice's potential gains are decreasing rapidly. Offering a 50/50 split is fair and emphasizes the time pressure.  It's unlikely I'll get a better deal if I wait longer, as Alice knows I'm incentivized to avoid reaching Round 12 where we both lose."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time, and the money is losing value fast. This is a reasonable offer that gives us both something. 
# Bob gain: 46 
# Alice gain: 54 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a tough one, but I think it's time to accept. Here's why:

* **Time pressure:** We're past the halfway point, and with each round, the potential gains decrease significantly, especially for Alice. 
* **Alice's position:**  Alice has been stubbornly sticking close to the 60/40 split, but this offer is her most significant concession yet. It suggests she's feeling the time crunch.
* **Diminishing returns:** While I believe I had the stronger negotiating position, waiting for a slightly better offer carries the risk of Alice becoming even more risk-averse and offering even less in later rounds. 

Taking 46 now is better than risking a smaller share later, or even worse, walking away with nothing."
