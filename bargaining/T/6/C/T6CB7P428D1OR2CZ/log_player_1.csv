"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can end this quickly.""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable for a first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll try to meet you in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $300,000 is worth 90% of the original $600,000, which is $540,000.

I'm not thrilled with the 30-70 split, but I'll try to get a better deal later. For now, I'll accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
