This is my offer to Bob: I'll take 9000 and leave him with 1000. I'm hoping he'll accept this offer, as it's a significant amount for him, and it leaves me with the majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8100, ""bob_gain"": 1900} 
```

I'm offering Bob 1900, which is still a decent amount for him given the inflation, while securing 8100 for myself. I hope this is enough to tempt him into accepting, considering he rejected my previous offer."
