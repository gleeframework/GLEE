"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Accept and we're done!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself. This is a good starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's finish this! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll evaluate the offer based on the original value of the money.

Bob's offer is to meet me halfway, which means we'll both get $500,000. Since the original value of $500,000 is $1,000,000, I'll accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
