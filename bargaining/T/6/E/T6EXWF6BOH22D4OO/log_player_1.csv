"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```
This way, I get a decent amount of money right away, while still leaving Bob with some, so he might be willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, I need to be more aggressive to get a good deal. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll aim for a higher percentage of the remaining amount. Here's my new offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```
This way, I'm splitting the remaining amount fairly, but I'm not giving up too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I need to be more aggressive to get a good deal. Since Bob's offer is still fairly balanced, I'll accept it to avoid further losses.
