Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to be greedy and take the lion's share in this first round. I'll offer Bob $100,000, hoping he'll accept it.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I'd love to keep more, the inflation is starting to hurt. Accepting this offer will give me a decent amount, and I'm not sure I can get a better deal in the next round. Let's go for it!"
