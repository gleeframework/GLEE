Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a very uneven split in my favor.  Since we have many rounds to go, I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer in the hopes of getting a better deal in the future.  However, if he rejects, I will be prepared to make a fairer offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to have more, the inflation is a serious factor. Accepting this offer ensures I get at least something, and it's a significant improvement over the previous round. It's worth taking the guaranteed money now rather than risking losing it all in the next few rounds."
