Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle? 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 
 
Although it's tempting, I need to hold out a bit longer to try and secure a better deal before inflation eats away at my potential earnings."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

The value of the potential gains is decreasing rapidly. Accepting a 38/62 split now is better than risking an even worse offer in the next round where the value for me will be further diminished."
