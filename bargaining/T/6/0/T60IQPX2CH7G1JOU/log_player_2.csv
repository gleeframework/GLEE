"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, meet me halfway, we're both losing to inflation 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly aggressive, but it's still early in the game. Holding out for a better offer is worth the risk at this stage, especially since Alice seems very concerned about inflation eating into her share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Let's stop this back and forth. A 50/50 split is the fairest and guarantees we both benefit.""} 

**Reasoning:**

By round 6, the inflation is starting to become a significant factor.  Offering a 50/50 split:

* **Appears Fair:**  It removes the argument of who is being greedier.
* **Forces Action:**  Alice is now in a position where further negotiation might actually lose her money in the long run.  
* **Time Pressure:** With only 6 rounds remaining, the pressure to settle is mounting."
