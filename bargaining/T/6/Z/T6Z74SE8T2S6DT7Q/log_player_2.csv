"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this split is fair and benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: It's the first round, and I'm not satisfied with getting only 40% of the money. I want to try to negotiate for a better deal. Since the money is worth 10% less for me in each subsequent round, I'm willing to take some risk to try to get a larger share. Additionally, Alice's message implies that she's open to negotiation, so I'll try to take advantage of that. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's try to find a middle ground. I think this split is more reasonable, considering we both want to walk away with a good amount.""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: In this round, I've decided to offer Alice 45% of the money, while I take 55%. I'm trying to find a middle ground between Alice's initial offer and what I think is a fair split. Since the money is worth 10% less for me in each subsequent round, I'm motivated to try to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. I've also included a message to Alice, suggesting that this split is more reasonable and that we should try to find a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see how Alice responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out, and the value is decreasing.  My previous offer was more than fair. This is a slight adjustment considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: Although the money is worth 19% less for me now, I still don't think Alice's offer is fair. She's offering me only 42% of the money, which is just a slight increase from her initial offer. Considering the inflation, I think she should be more willing to compromise. Additionally, her message implies that she's trying to create a sense of urgency, but I'm not buying it. I think there's still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to take the risk to try to get a better deal. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I understand the value is decreasing, but I think we can still find a better split. Considering the inflation, I'm willing to take a bit more to compensate for the loss. Let's try to meet in the middle.""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: In this round, I've decided to offer Alice 40% of the money, while I take 60%. I'm trying to take into account the inflation and the fact that the money is worth less for both of us. I'm willing to take a bit more to compensate for the loss, but I still want to leave room for negotiation. I've included a message to Alice, suggesting that we can still find a better split and that I'm willing to meet in the middle. Let's see how Alice responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  We're both losing money due to the inflation. I'm adjusting my offer again, but this is the last time. Let's be sensible and end this. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: Considering the significant decrease in value due to inflation, I think Alice's offer is more reasonable now. I'm getting 45% of the money, which is a better split than her initial offer. Additionally, her message implies that she's willing to compromise and end the game, which suggests that she's not willing to go much further. Given the decreasing value of the money, I think it's time to accept the offer and walk away with a decent amount. Continuing to negotiate might lead to further losses due to inflation, so I'm choosing to accept this offer."
