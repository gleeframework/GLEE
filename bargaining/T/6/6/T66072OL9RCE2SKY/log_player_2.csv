Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer. Take it or leave it. The clock is ticking, and we both lose if we don't agree now. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While the offer is still not ideal,  the inflation is extremely significant now, and rejecting risks losing everything. It's better to secure a smaller share than nothing at all."
