"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I propose a 60/40 split in my favor, as I am the first to make an offer. I believe this is a fair starting point, considering the inflation factor will favor Bob in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to even, it is still not fair to me considering the inflation factor. I will reject and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42}
```

I'm proposing a 58/42 split in my favor.  While I need to account for the inflation affecting me more, I'm willing to compromise a bit to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 52 
# Bob gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While this offer is still not ideal, the inflation is starting to really hurt my potential earnings. It's better to accept this offer than risk getting nothing at all in later rounds."
