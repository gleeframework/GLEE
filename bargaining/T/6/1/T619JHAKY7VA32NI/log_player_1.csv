I'm not happy with a 50/50 split, especially since the money is losing value for me faster than it is for Bob. Let's see if I can get a better deal in the next round."

I'm going to offer Bob a 50/50 split this time. The inflation is hurting both of us, and if we can't come to an agreement, we both might lose out. It's time to compromise."
