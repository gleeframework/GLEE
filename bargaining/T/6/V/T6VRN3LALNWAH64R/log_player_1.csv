"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'm offering a slightly higher share to myself, considering the inflation rate is higher for Bob. This way, we both get a significant amount, and it's a relatively fair start for negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn to propose a fair split. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting this offer because, considering the inflation, my gain of $45 is now worth less than it was in the first round, and Bob's higher inflation rate means his $55 is worth even less. I believe there's room for a more balanced offer that takes the devaluation into account. Let's see if I can propose a better split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll consider the inflation impact on both of us. Given that the money is worth less with each round, especially for Bob, I'll adjust my offer to make it more appealing while still aiming for a higher share due to the lower devaluation on my side.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's adjust""}\n\nI've increased my share slightly, considering the inflationary pressure, but still offer Bob a significant amount, hoping he'll see the value in accepting now rather than risking further devaluation in the next rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This offer accounts for inflation and is still in my favor slightly. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI'm accepting this offer because, although I aimed for a higher share initially, the progressive devaluation due to inflation means that holding out for another round risks reducing the value of any potential gain significantly. Bob's offer of $48 to me and $52 to himself, when adjusted for the inflation we've both experienced, seems more reasonable at this stage. Continuing might lead to a scenario where any gain is heavily diminished, so securing this amount now seems prudent."
