"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate, let's end it here""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but still a good compromise 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 5% less, I need to consider the value of the money in terms of its purchasing power.

With Bob's offer, I would get $4,000, which is still a decent amount, but I was hoping for a more even split. However, I also don't want to risk waiting for a better offer and potentially losing out on some of the money due to inflation.

I'll decide to reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer that's a bit more aggressive, considering the money is still worth the same for me but worth 10% less for Bob compared to the first round.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to give up too much 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gain still worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains worth 14.26% less, I need to consider the relative value of the money.

Bob's offer is a bit closer to a 50/50 split, but still slightly favors him. I'm not sure if I want to give up $200 more to get a slightly larger share.

I'll decide to reject this offer and see if I can get an even better deal.

I'll decide to accept this offer, as it seems like we've reached a good compromise.
