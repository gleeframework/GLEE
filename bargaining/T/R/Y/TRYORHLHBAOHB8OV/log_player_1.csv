"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and straightforward offer. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 400k, but I think I deserve more for being the one to make the next offer 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 5% decrease in value due to inflation, my gain of $400,000 is now worth $380,000.

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a bit low, but I'm willing to consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a bit low, I was hoping for a better deal. Let's try again.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain is now worth 95% of what it was in the first round, so I'll aim for a slightly higher offer.

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more for the risk of inflation.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 480k, but I think I deserve more considering the value of money is decreasing 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 14.26% decrease in value due to inflation, my gain of $480,000 is now worth $413,120.

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a bit more reasonable than the previous one, but I'm still not sure if it's the best deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a bit better, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. Let's try again.""
}
```"

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the continued inflation, my gain is now worth 19.26% less than in the first round, so I'll aim for an even higher offer to account for the decreasing value of money.

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to adjust for the inflation, I think this is a fairer split considering the decreasing value of money.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 520k, but I think I deserve more considering I'm the one who's been making the offers so far 
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 22.62% decrease in value due to inflation, my gain of $520,000 is now worth $401,344.

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a bit more reasonable than the previous ones, but I'm still not convinced that it's the best deal. However, I'm starting to run out of options and the value of my gain is decreasing rapidly. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Okay, I'll accept this offer. It's not ideal, but I don't want to risk getting an even worse deal with each passing round.""
}
