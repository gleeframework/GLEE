"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a larger share, but I need a bit more than that. How about a 55/45 split? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 65,
""bob_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""Bob, time is running out and the value is decreasing. I'm proposing 65/35.  It's better to secure something now.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting serious. I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger cut. Let's settle on 60/40. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is getting desperate and the value of his share is decreasing rapidly. While this offer is the same as Round 1, waiting him out means the deal will get better for me, or he'll be forced to accept a worse deal in a later round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 70,
""bob_gain"": 30,
""message"": ""Bob, I'm aiming for a fair resolution, but we're running out of time. 70/30 is my final offer.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my last offer.  We are losing too much to inflation.  Take 35 now, or risk getting nothing. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While the deal is getting worse, Bob is clearly panicking.  He's willing to take a massive loss to inflation just to end the game. There's a good chance I can get a better deal if I hold out for another round or two."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 75,
""bob_gain"": 25,
""message"": ""Bob, this is it. 75/25, or we both lose. Take it or leave it.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  I'm pushing Bob to the limit now. He's shown he's willing to accept a bad deal to avoid getting nothing. This offer is risky, but the potential reward is high, and we're running out of rounds."
