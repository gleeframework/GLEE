"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I propose taking 90% of the money and leaving Bob with 10%. It's a fair starting point, considering the risk of inflation in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 810000, ""bob_gain"": 190000}
```

I'm proposing to take 81% of the money, leaving 19% for Bob. I'm adjusting my offer to reflect the inflation, while also trying to be fair. I'm confident that this offer will be more appealing to Bob than the previous round's offer."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is better than the last round, I still believe I can get a better deal if we continue negotiating. The inflation is hitting me hard, but I'm not ready to accept such a small share.  I'm still confident I can get a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 729000, ""bob_gain"": 271000}

I'm proposing to take 72.9% of the money, leaving 27.1% for Bob. I'm continuing to adjust my offer to reflect the inflation, but I'm also trying to be reasonable and find a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly unfavorable, but I'm still not willing to accept such a small share. We are getting close to the end of the game, and I need to be strategic to get a decent share. I believe I can still get a better deal if we continue negotiating."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 656100, ""bob_gain"": 343900}
```

I'm proposing to take 65.61% of the money, leaving 34.39% for Bob. I'm aiming for a solution that is as fair as possible considering the effects of inflation. While I'm feeling the pressure of the decreasing value of money, I'm still trying to be reasonable and find a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still not satisfactory. While the inflation is significantly impacting my share, I'm not willing to accept such a low percentage of the money. We are approaching the end of the game, and I'm determined to secure a more equitable deal. I believe we can still find a solution where we both get a more substantial share of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 590490, ""bob_gain"": 409510}
```

I'm proposing to take 59.049% of the money, leaving 40.951% for Bob. While the inflation continues to reduce the value of my share, I'm still holding onto a significant portion of the money.  I believe this offer is fair and reflects our current circumstances. I hope Bob will finally accept to avoid both of us getting nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

With only two rounds left, the risk of getting nothing is too high.  Even with the inflation, a 50/50 split is the most reasonable outcome at this point."
