"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and let's call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering you $2,000, and I'll take the remaining $8,000. This way, we can both get something and avoid further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to find a more balanced split! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual values are:

* Bob's gain: $4000 * 0.8 = $3200
* Alice's gain: $6000

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, considering the initial offer was $8,000 for me. I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle and let's finalize the deal!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give you a slightly larger share, but still keeping a significant majority for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, it's a fair deal! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual values are:

* Bob's gain: $5000 * 0.516 (1 - 0.484) = $2580
* Alice's gain: $5000

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, considering the initial offer was $8,000 for me. However, splitting it 50/50 is a fair offer, and I don't want to risk going to the next round. I'll accept this offer.
