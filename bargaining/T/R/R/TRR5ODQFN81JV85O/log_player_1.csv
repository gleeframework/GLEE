"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script - I'll take 60 this time, and you can have 40.  It's a fair deal considering the inflation! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about Bob's proposal, especially since he's trying to flip the script and take the majority of the money. I think I can do better than a 40/60 split, especially considering the inflation. I'll reject this offer and hope to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55/45 is a more reasonable split considering the inflation""}

I'm trying to find a middle ground, taking into account the decreasing value of the money due to inflation. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can wrap up the game."
