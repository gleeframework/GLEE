  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a fair share, let's end it here!""
}

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round. I'm not sure if Bob's gain is worth the same, but I'll assume it is.

I'm not too thrilled about giving Bob $700,000, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:
