Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. While I understand your desire for a fair distribution, I believe this split better reflects the potential for value loss with each round. Let's end this fairly and avoid further devaluation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
