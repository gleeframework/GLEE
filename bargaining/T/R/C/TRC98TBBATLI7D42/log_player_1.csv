Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $100, leaving Bob with 40%."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money, my gain of 50 is now worth 40 (60% of the original 100) and Bob's gain of 50 is now worth 45 (50% of the original 100).

I accept this offer.
