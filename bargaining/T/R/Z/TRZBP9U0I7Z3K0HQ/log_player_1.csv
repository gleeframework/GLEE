"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Fair 60-40 split""}\n\n###\n\nLet's start by proposing a fair 60-40 split, where I, Alice, receive $6,000 and Bob receives $4,000. This division allows both of us to walk away with a substantial amount, considering the total sum is $10,000. The message is brief and to the point, emphasizing the fairness of the split. Given the impact of inflation, starting with a slightly higher offer might incentivize Bob to accept early, mitigating the loss of value over rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be more equitable this time. I'm offering you 40%. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nGiven the current offer and the impact of inflation, accepting 40% of the money, which is now worth 20% less, seems less favorable. In the first round, the offer was 60% for me, and now it's 40%, which is a significant drop. Considering the game's structure and the devaluation of money over rounds, it might be strategic to hold out for a potentially better offer or to make a counteroffer that could be more advantageous. Rejecting this offer allows me to proceed to the next round, albeit with the risk of further inflation impacts."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet closer to the middle.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, considering the impact of inflation and the previous offers, I'm proposing a division that slightly adjusts my initial offer downward to meet Bob closer to the middle. The idea is to find a compromise that might be more acceptable to Bob, given that we've both had a chance to see the other's perspective and that the value of the money is decreasing. By suggesting a 58-42 split, I'm aiming to appear more flexible while still advocating for a share that reflects my initial valuation. The message emphasizes the consideration of inflation, hinting at the mutual benefit of settling sooner rather than later."
