Alice's offer:

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, your offer was a bit too greedy for me. Let's be reasonable, I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor.  The inflation will only worsen the deal for you in the next round.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want a larger share, but the longer this goes on the less we'll both have. I propose a 50/50 split to ensure we both benefit before inflation eats away at the value. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
