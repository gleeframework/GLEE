"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
``` 

I'm going to start with a pretty high offer, as I have a lot of rounds to play with.  I figure Bob might be tempted to take it, but if he's greedy, we can negotiate in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being pretty greedy here. I'm not going to accept that offer. I'll try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob 4000. This is still less than what he asked for in the previous round, but I'm hoping he'll be willing to compromise a bit now that he knows I'm not afraid to reject his offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is getting even more greedy.  I'm still going to reject this offer.  I'm starting to think he's playing a game here, but I'm going to see if I can get him to budge in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a 50/50 split.  The inflation is getting pretty bad now, so I'm going to have to try to compromise.  I'm hoping that Bob will realize he's pushing his luck and take this offer."
