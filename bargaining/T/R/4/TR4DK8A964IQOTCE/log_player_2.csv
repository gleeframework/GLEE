Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I propose 6000 for me and 4000 for you, Bob.  It's better to take a fair deal now than risk losing more to inflation.

# Alice gain: 6000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the inflation impacts us differently, but your offer was too skewed in your favor.  I'm proposing 5500 for me and 4500 for you. This accounts for the inflation difference while still being a reasonable split. Let's settle this now before we both lose out further. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
