"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Not bad, Bob! But I'm not going to accept your offer. I think I can do better than that.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll try to make a better offer this time. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

This is a slightly more balanced offer, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal!"
