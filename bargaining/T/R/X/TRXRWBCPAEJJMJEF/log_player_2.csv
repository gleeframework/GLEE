"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer.  Even though the money is worth less in future rounds, I'm hoping I can get a better deal. Let's see what Alice proposes next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}
``` 

I'm going to offer Alice 40 dollars, and keep 60 for myself. I'm hoping she'll accept this, as it's a more even split than her previous offer. However, I'm aware the money is worth less with each passing round, so I'm trying to secure a good deal for myself."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

Even though the money is worth less for me now, accepting this offer is the best option.  Alice is offering me a significantly better deal than her initial offer, and rejecting again risks getting nothing in the end.  I'm going to take what I can get."
