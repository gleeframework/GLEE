"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. Take this good offer while it still holds value for you. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. The current offer doesn't seem fair, and I'm willing to take the risk of inflation to try and get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering the inflation, I think this is a fair offer.""}\n\n###\n\nSince the money is worth 20% less for me in each round, I want to try to end the game quickly while still getting a decent share. Meeting in the middle seems like a reasonable approach, taking into account the decreasing value of the money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being generous, Bob, but the clock is ticking. The value is dwindling with every second. 
# Bob gain: 3200 
# Alice gain: 6800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlthough the value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me, Alice's offer doesn't significantly improve upon her initial proposal. Given that we're only in the third round, I'm willing to take the risk and continue negotiating for a more favorable split.\n\n###\n\nPlease let Alice know that I've rejected her offer and wait for my next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4200, ""alice_gain"": 5800, ""message"": ""Considering the rapid inflation on my end, I'm willing to compromise but still need a fairer split than previously offered.""}\n\n###\n\nGiven the significant impact of inflation on my potential gain, I'm aiming to find a middle ground that acknowledges the decreasing value while still pushing for a more equitable division than Alice's previous offers. The idea is to convey a sense of urgency and willingness to compromise, hoping Alice will see the mutual benefit in ending the game sooner rather than later."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer. It's a decent deal considering the inflation working against you. Let's settle this before we both lose out. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nAt this point, the value of the money has decreased significantly for me due to inflation. Alice's offer of $3500, although not ideal, represents a better value than what I might achieve in further rounds due to the rapidly diminishing worth of the money. It's crucial to realize that continuing the game might lead to a scenario where the potential gains become negligible. Alice's message suggests this is her final offer, implying that she might not be willing to compromise further. Given these considerations, accepting the current offer seems like the most pragmatic decision to secure some value before it's too late."
