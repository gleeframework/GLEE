"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it 60/40""}\n\n###\n\nI'm being generous and offering Bob 40% of the money, while I take 60%. I want to show that I'm willing to compromise and find a mutually beneficial solution. I'm also trying to set a good tone for the negotiation and show that I'm willing to listen to Bob's concerns. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your share decreases each round with inflation. Let's be practical. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money I gain is worth 20% less in this round, I need to take that into account when considering Bob's offer. With inflation, my share of 4500 is actually worth less than it would have been in the first round. Considering this, I think I can do better than 4500, even with the decreasing value of the money. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nSince the money I gain is worth 20% less in each round, I need to adjust my offer accordingly. I'll try to find a balance between getting a fair share and taking into account the decreasing value of the money. I'll offer Bob a slightly larger share than before, while still trying to get a good deal for myself.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I'm willing to compromise and give you a bit more. Let's settle on 58/42""}\n\n###\n\nI'm trying to show Bob that I'm aware of the inflation and its effects on the negotiation, and that I'm willing to adapt and find a mutually beneficial solution. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out, and your share keeps shrinking. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on! With the money I gain being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I need to carefully consider Bob's offer. Since he claims this is his final offer, I need to decide whether to accept it or risk getting nothing if we can't agree on a deal. Given the decreasing value of the money, 4000 might be the best I can get at this point. I don't want to risk walking away with nothing, so I'll accept Bob's offer.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}"
