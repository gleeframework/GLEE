"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, I'll take 60% and you'll get 40%""}\n\nI'll start by offering Bob 40% of the total amount, $400,000, and I'll take the remaining 60%, $600,000. I've included a message to Bob suggesting that this is a reasonable split, in the hopes that he'll accept and we can conclude the game quickly.\n\nPlease let me know how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can find a fairer split. How about 55% for me and 45% for you? 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since I initially offered Bob 40% and he rejected it, I'm not surprised that he's now suggesting a split where he gets 55%. Given the inflation, the actual value of the money has decreased, but I still think I can negotiate a better deal.\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nPlease let me know how the game proceeds!"

I'll suggest a split where I get 52.5% ($525,000) and Bob gets 47.5% ($475,000). My message to Bob will frame this as a compromise, in the hopes that he'll see it as a reasonable middle ground and accept the offer.\n\nPlease let me know how Bob responds!"
