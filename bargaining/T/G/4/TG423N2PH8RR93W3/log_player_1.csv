I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor.  I figure this is a fair starting point, as I'm taking the risk of making the first offer. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation! I won't accept this offer. I'll make a counter-proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm lowering my share to 80%, but I'm still keeping a significant portion of the pie.  Inflation is a factor, but I'm confident that a fair compromise can be reached."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob is getting greedy! This inflation is hurting me, but I won't be pushed around. I'll make a counter-proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm lowering my share again, but I'm still holding out for a decent portion of the money. I'm hoping Bob realizes that he needs to be more reasonable or he'll risk losing everything."
