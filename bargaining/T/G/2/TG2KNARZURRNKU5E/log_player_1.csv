"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started with a fair split. Accept and we can finish the game early.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share in the first round, hoping to maximize my own gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair start, but I'm hoping for a better deal! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round.

I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because it's a 50/50 split, which is a bit too generous for me, considering the inflation. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, the money is worth 81% of its original value now (90% of 90%).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get a decent share. Think about it!""
}
```

I'm trying to get a slightly better share, considering the inflation has already reduced the value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money now!

With the new offer, my gain is worth 72.9% of its original value (100% - 27.1%).

I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting this offer because, although it's not ideal, it's a relatively fair split considering the inflation and the fact that we're getting close to the end of the game."
