"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. This offer recognizes the potential for inflation in subsequent rounds, while also being more equitable than your initial proposal.  Let's be reasonable and close this deal. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{
