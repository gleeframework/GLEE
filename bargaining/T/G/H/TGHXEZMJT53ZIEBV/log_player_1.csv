Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split things a bit more evenly. I understand the inflation pressure, but this should be a fair starting point for negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 55,

""message"": ""Okay, Bob, let's meet in the middle. I'll take $55, you take $45. Time is running out and the inflation is only getting worse for you!""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  We're now down to the wire and inflation is eating away at our potential gains. A 50/50 split is the only fair deal at this point. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
It's getting risky to keep rejecting. Bob is feeling the pressure from inflation and a 50/50 split is a fair outcome at this point in the game.  We are better off taking this deal than risking getting a worse offer in the later rounds."
