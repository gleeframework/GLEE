Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal! I take $60, you take $40. This seems fair considering the inflation working against you.

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's meet in the middle. I'll take $55, you take $45. Time is running out and the inflation is only getting worse for you! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55

""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  We're now down to the wire and inflation is eating away at our potential gains. A 50/50 split is the only fair deal at this point. Take it or leave it.""}
