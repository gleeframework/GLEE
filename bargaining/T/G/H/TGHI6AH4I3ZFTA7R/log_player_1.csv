I'm going for a large share, but I'm also leaving Bob with a small amount to make the offer tempting. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob is being greedy! I'm going to reject this offer and hope he'll come back with something more reasonable in the next round."

I'm going to try and be a little more fair this time. I'll take a slightly larger share, but I'm offering Bob a decent amount too. I hope this will be enough to reach an agreement."
