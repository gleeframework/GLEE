I'm going to start with a pretty generous offer to Bob, hoping to end the game quickly.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll accept this offer.  While I'd prefer more, the inflation is a real factor, and 50/50 is a fair split."
