"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation. While her offer is getting slightly better, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. I need to show firmness and push for a more equitable split, even if it means risking further inflation."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""This is ridiculous.  A 50/50 split is the only fair outcome. Take it or leave it.""}

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your 50/50 is not as valuable as you think 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is blatantly trying to wear me down with the inflation.  While getting $44 is better than nothing, accepting this offer sets a bad precedent. I need to show I'm serious about getting a fair deal.  I'm hoping she'll start to negotiate more realistically soon."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but this needs to end soon.  Time is literally money.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, I'm being kind 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The game has reached a critical point.  While the offer is far from ideal, the inflation is severely cutting into potential gains. Accepting $45 now is better than risking a worse offer later or even getting nothing if we run out of rounds. Alice knows this and is unlikely to offer anything better."
