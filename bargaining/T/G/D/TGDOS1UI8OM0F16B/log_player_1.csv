Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a very straightforward split: $9000 for me and $1000 for Bob.  This is a significant starting point for me, and since we only have 12 rounds, I want to get as much as possible early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer is the best move at this point. With inflation and the limited rounds,  I'm likely to get a worse deal if I reject and make a counteroffer. Getting $5000 now is better than risking getting nothing later."
