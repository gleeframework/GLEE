"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start""
}
```

I'm proposing that we split the $100 evenly, with each of us getting $50. This way, we can both get a fair share and set a good tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have a smaller share this round, but I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal than a 50/50 split. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the money is worth 5% less, so the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: $30 x 0.95 = $28.50
Bob gain: $70 x 0.95 = $66.50

I'm not thrilled about taking a smaller share, but Bob's offer is still a good one. I'll accept it to avoid losing more value due to inflation.
