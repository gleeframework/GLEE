"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

This offer gives Bob a small amount, but it's a good starting point.  It sets the stage for future negotiations, and I'm confident I can get a better deal if Bob rejects it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is tempting, but I believe I can get a better deal.  Since my gains are worth less with inflation, I need to push for a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to account for the inflation, but I'm still aiming for a larger share.  Hopefully, Bob will see the value in getting a consistent share, even if it's small."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is getting greedy, and the inflation is hurting me. I need to push for a better deal. While I'm losing value with each round, I still have the power to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer again, but still try to maintain a significant share. I'm hoping that Bob will realize that with inflation, his gain is decreasing as well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly unfair, and I'm losing significant value due to inflation. I need to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm  lowering my offer again, but I'm still aiming for a larger share. We are both losing value with inflation, so I need to ensure that I get a decent portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is becoming increasingly unfair, and the inflation is severely impacting my share. I need to hold out for a better deal. Even though we are both losing value, I still have the power to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm going to propose an even split. We're both losing a significant amount of money with inflation, and this seems like the fairest option at this point.  If Bob rejects this, I'm not sure we will be able to reach an agreement, and both of us will lose out entirely."
