"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very lopsided offer. I'm hoping Bob will accept it in the first round, as it's still a decent amount for him, and avoids any potential inflation risks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, this is a fair and equal split. I don't want to risk further inflation and end up with nothing."
