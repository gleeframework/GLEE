"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a decent amount for now.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 4,000$ and keeping 6,000$ for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than that. This is a more balanced split. Let's see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's new offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that this is a good split for me, especially considering the inflation. I'd like to make a new proposal that takes into account the decreasing value of money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer, taking into account the 10% decrease in value of the money I gain and the 5% decrease in value of the money Bob gains:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4900,
  ""bob_gain"": 5100,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not willing to give up too much. Let's see if you'll accept this offer.""
}
```"
