"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $1,000,000 equally, with each of us getting $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have a smaller share, but I'm still being generous! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about the 40% difference in the proposed split. I'd like to try to negotiate for a more equal share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I'll take a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise""}

I'm proposing a slightly more asymmetrical split, with me getting $450,000 and Bob getting $550,000. I'm trying to find a middle ground that's still reasonable for both of us."
