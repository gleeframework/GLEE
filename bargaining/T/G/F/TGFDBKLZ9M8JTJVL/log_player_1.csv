"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with this""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I get 60 dollars and Bob gets 40 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not convinced that meeting in the middle is the best option, especially since the money is worth less due to inflation. I'd like to try to negotiate further to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve a bit more""}

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, where I get 55 dollars and Bob gets 45 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being greedy, meet me in the middle again 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I was being a bit greedy, and Bob's offer is a reasonable compromise. Meeting in the middle again at 45-55 seems like a fair deal, considering the effects of inflation. I'll accept this offer."
