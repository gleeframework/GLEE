"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you a good deal, but don't expect me to go lower!""
}
```

This way, I get 70% of the original $100, and Bob gets 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. Seems fair to me! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $50 is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round. 

I'll have to think carefully about this offer...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure if splitting it evenly is the best deal for me, considering the inflation. I'd like to see if I can get a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my gain is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, so I'll aim to get a higher percentage to compensate for the loss in value.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair deal considering the inflation.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a better deal than your last offer!  Let's wrap this up. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is catching up!

Considering the significant loss in value, I'll have to think carefully about this offer...

Since my gain of $40 is worth only 64% of what it was in the first round, I'll have to decide whether it's enough to accept.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure if I want to settle for a smaller share, especially considering the significant inflation. I'd like to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really taking a toll on my gain!

Considering the significant loss in value, I'll have to make a more aggressive offer to compensate for the inflation.

Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, but I still think I deserve a bigger share. Take it or leave it!""
}
```"
