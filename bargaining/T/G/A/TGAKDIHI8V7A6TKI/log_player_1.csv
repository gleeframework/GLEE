"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my initial offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to start. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!
