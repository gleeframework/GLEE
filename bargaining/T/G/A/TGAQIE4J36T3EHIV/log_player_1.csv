"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a chance to negotiate later.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 20%. This way, we both have a decent amount to start with, and Bob has a chance to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly. We can both get a good amount this way. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, I'll have to reassess my priorities.

I don't think splitting it evenly is the best option for me, considering the decreasing value of the money. I'd rather try to negotiate for more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the decrease in value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a decent share, but I need to prioritize my own gain to account for inflation.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's compromise. I'm willing to take a slightly bigger share this time, but I think we can still both get a good amount. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is decreasing in value rapidly. I need to think carefully about this offer.

While Bob is taking a bigger share, I'm not sure if it's the best option for me, considering the rapidly decreasing value of the money. I'd rather try to negotiate for a higher share, but I also don't want to risk getting nothing if I reject this offer and the game ends.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth significantly less than in the first round, and I need to prioritize my gain.

I'll make a more aggressive offer, but I'll also leave a small chance for Bob to accept and end the game.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a small share, but I need to secure my own gain to account for the rapid inflation.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We need to find a compromise. I'm willing to take a larger share this time, but I think we should aim for a more equitable split to avoid further losses due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth even less than before, and I'm getting worried that I'll be left with nothing if I don't secure a good deal soon.

Considering the rapidly decreasing value of the money, I think I should prioritize getting a larger share now rather than trying to negotiate for more. However, I'm not sure if 30% is enough.

I'll accept this offer, hoping that it's better than risking getting nothing.
