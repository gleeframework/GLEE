"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, you get a smaller share, but it's still better than nothing 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
