I'm proposing to keep $9,000 and give Bob $1,000. This is a pretty hefty offer for me to give up a lot of money, but I want to see if Bob is willing to accept a smaller share to avoid getting nothing at all if we go through all 12 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:

# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
``` 

I'm increasing my offer to $7,000 for myself and $3,000 for Bob. Hopefully, this is a more fair offer that he'll accept. I want to avoid getting stuck in a cycle of rejections and eventually ending up with nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000

``` 
While I'd prefer a larger share, getting $5,000 is better than risking getting nothing if we continue to reject each other's offers."
