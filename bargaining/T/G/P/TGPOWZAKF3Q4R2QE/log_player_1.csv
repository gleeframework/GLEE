"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80/20, a fair start to our negotiation""
}
```

I'm starting with a relatively generous offer, but I'm not giving away too much, just to see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be more equitable. This offer is fair, considering the potential for inflation. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

Considering the new offer, I'll have to be more cautious. Since Bob's offer is still quite skewed towards his gain, I'll reject it for now. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Too generous to Bob, let's aim for a more balanced split""
}
```

I'm hoping that Bob will come back with a more even split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer, taking into account the inflation and the fact that Bob's offer was too skewed:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, a 50/50 split is a fair starting point""
}
```

I'm aiming for a more balanced split this time, hoping that Bob will accept it."
