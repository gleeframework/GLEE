"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more careful with my proposal this time.

I reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

```

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting closer, but I'm still not ready to meet you halfway!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $450,000 and keeping $550,000 for myself, trying to stay ahead of the inflation curve."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give a bit more, but I think this is a fair split 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob's offer is the same as my previous offer, but with the effects of inflation taken into account.
