"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, Bob! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm Bob, and I want to see if I can get a better deal.  Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering my efforts in this negotiation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle, Bob! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is making the money less valuable. Accepting this offer guarantees me something, and the 4500 is still a decent amount."
