"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my opening offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}

I'm starting with a fair split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game early!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'd rather not accept an offer that gives me less than I initially proposed. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}

I'm aiming to increase my share slightly, but still leaving room for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is making the money worth less, so I'll be more cautious with my next move. Since Bob's offer is still a 50-50 split, but considering the inflation effect, it's actually a better deal for me than my previous offer. I'll accept this offer.
