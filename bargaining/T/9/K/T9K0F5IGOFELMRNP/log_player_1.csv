"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair and balanced start!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the $100 and Bob gets 40%. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I think I deserve more for taking the risk of rejection! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too thrilled about the 80/20 split, but I don't want to risk going to the next round and losing even more value due to inflation. I'll accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
