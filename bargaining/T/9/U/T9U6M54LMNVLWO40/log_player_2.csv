"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with this.  A reasonable offer for both of us given the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's better to see if I can get a better deal.  I'll take the risk of inflation and try to negotiate a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'm taking a bigger share this time, but we'll both still get a decent amount.  What do you say?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my last offer was more than fair.  This is my final offer, let's close this out. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

Although I would have preferred a larger share, Alice's offer is reasonable considering the inflation and the fact it's her final offer.  It's better to take what I can get and move on."
