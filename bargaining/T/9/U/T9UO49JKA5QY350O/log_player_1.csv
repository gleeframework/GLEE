Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  Since I'm the first to propose, I want to see if I can secure a large chunk of the money.  I'll also try to see how Bob feels about the offer before we get to the inflation rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While I'm losing out on a lot of money due to inflation, I'm still gaining $5000, which is better than the $7200 I would get if I rejected Bob's offer and we moved to round 3.  There's no guarantee that Bob will be as generous with his proposal next round."
