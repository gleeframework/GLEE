"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable for the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a slightly more even split is fair, considering inflation will affect us both.  Let's see what you think! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the 45-55 split is actually a pretty good deal for me, as I'll be getting a larger share of the reduced total value.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
