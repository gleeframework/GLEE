**Reasoning:**

This is a classic game theory scenario with a ticking clock element. While Alice is being tough, it's important to analyze the situation realistically:

* **Inflation's Bite:** With each round, the value of the money plummets for Bob. Holding out for a better deal is becoming increasingly risky.
* **Alice's Strategy:** Alice knows Bob is feeling the pressure of inflation. She's likely to keep pushing for a larger share knowing Bob's position weakens each round.
* **Future Uncertainty:** There's no guarantee Alice will offer a better deal in a future round. It's possible her offers will get worse, putting Bob in an even weaker bargaining position.

**The Current Offer:** While not ideal, getting $3800 is significantly better than risking an even worse offer in a later round where the value diminishes further.  

**It's time to cut losses and accept the offer before inflation eats away at the potential gains any further.**"
