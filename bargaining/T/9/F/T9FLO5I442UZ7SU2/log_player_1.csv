"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""Let's get the ball rolling! Accept and we can finish the game.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get the entire $100, and Bob gets nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Fair split, let's start with a reasonable offer. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","A fair split is a good starting point.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I accept Bob's offer. Let's divide the money fairly and finish the game!"
