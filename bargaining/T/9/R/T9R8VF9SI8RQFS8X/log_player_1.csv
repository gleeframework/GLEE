  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a fair share, let's settle now!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40, which is a generous 40% of the total amount. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can wrap up the game!"

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'm not getting taken advantage of! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is quite lopsided in his favor.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round. I'm not willing to accept such a small share of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's make a deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $55, which is a bit more generous than before. I'm hoping he'll accept this compromise and we can finally settle the game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, you can have a small piece of the pie! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering the drastic reduction in the value of the money, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. However, I still don't want to give up too much.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer. I'm not willing to accept such a small share of the money, especially considering the significant erosion of its value due to inflation. I'll try to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now, so I'll have to be more cautious with my offer. Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 32.4,
  ""bob_gain"": 67.6,
  ""message"": ""A bit more balanced, but still a fair deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still trying to get a decent chunk of the remaining money. I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to him."
