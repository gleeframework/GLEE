"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5}
```

I'm going to start by offering a generous deal to Bob, hoping he'll accept it in the first round.  This way, we both get a decent amount of money without risking inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is fair, and I'm not sure I can get a better deal. With inflation, my share is worth less with each round, so accepting this offer is the best choice."
