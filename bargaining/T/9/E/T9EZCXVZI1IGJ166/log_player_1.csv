"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}

This is a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","That's a pretty lopsided offer in Bob's favor. I'll reject it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In round 3, I'll try to make a more balanced offer. Here it is:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}

This offer gives me a slight edge, but still keeps the difference relatively small."
