"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I'll take the majority, but you get a decent chunk.  Hope you agree! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While it's tempting to take the $100,000, it's far too early in the game to settle for such a small share.  Let's see if Alice is willing to offer more."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'm offering a more balanced split. Let's be reasonable and get this done early.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a larger share to make this worthwhile for me. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

Alice is still offering a very uneven split.  I need to make sure I'm getting a more fair share of the money.  Let's see if we can reach a more equitable agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""It's time to move towards a more balanced split. Let's be reasonable and find a middle ground.""}
