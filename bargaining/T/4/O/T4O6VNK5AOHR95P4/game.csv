60.0,40.0,"Bob, I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. It's a fair offer considering I'm the one facing inflation.  Let's wrap this up quickly!",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"Alice, your initial offer was a bit too steep for me. Let's meet in the middle - I propose a 55/45 split.  Time is ticking and it's impacting your share more than mine.",Bob,2,
,,"Bob, while I appreciate you meeting me slightly closer to the middle, the inflation rate makes this deal unfavorable for me in the long run. Let's try to find a more equitable split.",Alice,2,reject
58.0,42.0,"Bob, I understand your position, but the clock is working against me. I'm proposing 58/42. This recognizes your desire for a larger share while still reflecting the impact inflation has on my gains.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
44.0,56.0,"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a more even split.  However, the deal needs to be even sweeter for me to agree with the time pressure we're under. I propose 56/44.",Bob,4,
,,"Bob, I'm sensing a pattern here, and it's not in my favor.  You're using the inflation to pressure me into accepting a smaller share.  Let's be reasonable. I need a better offer to make this worthwhile for me.",Alice,4,reject
57.0,43.0,"Bob, let's stop this back and forth.  I'm offering 57/43.  This is a compromise and accounts for the time pressure we're both under.  Let's be pragmatic and close this deal.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
42.0,58.0,"Alice, you're right, we need to wrap this up. I'm proposing 58/42. It's a strong offer considering the shrinking pot from your end. Let's be done with this.",Bob,6,
,,"Bob, you're trying to pull a fast one! You know the value is decreasing for me each round, and you're just trying to stall me out. This isn't about a strong offer, it's about fairness.  If you don't come back with a significantly better offer next round, this deal is off.",Alice,6,reject
56.0,44.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm offering 56/44 - my lowest offer.  Take it or leave it.  We're running out of time, and I'd rather walk away with something than nothing.",Alice,7,
