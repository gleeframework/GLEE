"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'm willing to give you 10%, but I think we can find a better deal later. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's too early to accept such a small share.  There's plenty of time to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. It's a fair starting point considering the potential for inflation."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I believe a 65/35 split is a more sustainable deal considering the inflation factor. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
I'm still holding out for a better deal. There are still many rounds left, and the inflation factor is only going to increase."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Let's compromise. A 55/45 split in my favor seems like a fair compromise considering the potential for further inflation. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a larger share to offset the declining value of the money."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to move closer to your proposed split, but 575/425 is the best I can do right now.  We both need to be careful about inflation, but I also need to make sure I get a reasonable share. 
# Bob gain: 425000 
# Alice gain: 575000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer ensures I get a significant amount of money. The inflation is becoming a serious concern, and continuing to negotiate risks losing even more."
