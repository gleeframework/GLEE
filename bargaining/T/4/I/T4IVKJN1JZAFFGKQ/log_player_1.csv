"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly, I'll take 60%""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a division of $1,000,000 where I, Alice, will receive $600,000 and Bob will receive $400,000. My message to Bob is, ""Let's divide fairly, I'll take 60%."" This offer seems reasonable because it gives me a larger share, reflecting the fact that each round, the money loses more value for me than it does for Bob, creating a sense of urgency on my part. However, it still offers Bob a substantial amount, hopefully making it tempting enough for him to accept and end the game early, minimizing the impact of inflation on both our parts.\n\n###\n\nYour turn, Bob! Will you accept this offer, or do you want to proceed to the next round? Remember, with each passing round, the money's value decreases more significantly for me than for you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's more fair this way, given the inflation difference. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI reject Bob's offer. Given the significant difference in how inflation affects us, accepting this offer would put me at a considerable disadvantage. The money I gain is already worth 20% less than in the first round, and accepting a lower amount than I initially proposed would compound this loss. It's in my interest to proceed to the next round, hoping to negotiate a better deal that takes into account the disproportionate impact of inflation on my gains.\n\n###\n\nLet's proceed to the next round. It's my turn again to make an offer. Remember, the goal is to find a division that both of us can accept, considering the decreasing value of the money with each round.\n\n###\n\nMy next offer will aim to balance the impact of inflation on both of us, while also making it attractive enough for Bob to accept, ending the game before the money loses even more value.\n\n###\n\nNew Offer:\n{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet closer to the middle.""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn, Bob! Will you accept this revised offer, or do you want to continue to the next round?"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet closer to the middle.""}\n\n###\n\nGiven the increasing impact of inflation with each passing round, I've decided to propose a division that slightly favors me but still offers Bob a substantial amount. By suggesting that I take $550,000 and Bob takes $450,000, I'm attempting to find a middle ground that acknowledges the different rates at which the money loses value for us. This offer is more generous to Bob than my initial proposal but still recognizes my urgency to conclude the game due to the higher rate of inflation affecting my gains.\n\n###\n\nI hope this offer will be more acceptable to Bob, considering the message ""Considering inflation, let's meet closer to the middle."" It's crucial to end the game as soon as possible to minimize further losses due to inflation.\n\n###\n\nYour turn, Bob! Will you accept this offer, or do you wish to proceed, keeping in mind the decreasing value of the money with each round?"
