"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60-40, it's a fair start!

# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm not sure if Alice is aware of the inflation. It's only my first turn, and I can potentially get more if I reject."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""I think a 65-35 split is fairer, considering the potential for inflation. Let's get this done!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Time to get serious, 50-50 is the only way to go! 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, the potential for further inflation is a real concern.  A 50/50 split is the fairest option at this point, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all."
