"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, it's a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, and I'll take $600,000. The message is a friendly one, trying to set a positive tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 65-35 split is fairer, considering the potential for inflation. Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth less for me, but Bob's offer is even more skewed in his favor.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and wait for the next round, hoping to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my offer is worth 20% less than the previous round. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to compensate for the decreasing value of money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Time to get serious, 50-50 is the only way to go!""
}
```

I'm offering a 50-50 split, hoping to put pressure on Bob to accept a more equal division of the money."
