"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:**  The money I gain is worth less, so I need to be more accepting of a lower offer.
* **Alice's Offer:**  While Alice's share is higher, mine is still significantly better than in Round 1. 
* **Risk:**  Continuing to reject offers could lead to a situation where I get nothing due to the limited rounds.

It's a gamble, but accepting this offer gives me a decent chunk of money, even with the inflation."
