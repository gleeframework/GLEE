"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose to take 90 dollars and let Bob have 10 dollars. I'm hoping that Bob will accept, but if not, I'll have to recalculate my strategy in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While I'm getting less than my initial proposal, the inflation means that I'll get a higher percentage of the total value if I accept now. It's also likely that the value will decrease even more in the future."
