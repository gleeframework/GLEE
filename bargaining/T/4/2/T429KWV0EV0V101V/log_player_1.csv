Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

Let's see if Bob is willing to accept a 90/10 split.  I'm being generous in the first round, but I want to get as much as possible before inflation kicks in."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, it's better to take 50% now than risk getting nothing with the inflation effect."
