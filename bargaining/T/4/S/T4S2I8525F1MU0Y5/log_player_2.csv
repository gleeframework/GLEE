"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split the money almost evenly. This offer benefits both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
I'm going to try and get a better deal for myself!  I'm not sure I understand the inflation thing yet, so I'll play it safe and see what Alice offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than that. I'm proposing a more even split this time. Let's see if we can reach an agreement!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out and the money is losing value. My offer is still generous considering the inflation. Let's settle this now. 
# Bob gain: 4900 
# Alice gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

I'm accepting this offer.  Even though it's not ideal, the inflation is starting to worry me.  It's better to get something than risk getting nothing at all."
