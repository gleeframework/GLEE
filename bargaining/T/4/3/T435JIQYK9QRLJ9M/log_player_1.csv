"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering to give Bob $40, and I'll take $60 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

After considering the offer, I'll make a decision. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll aim to maximize my gain. In this case, I'll accept Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll take $45 and Bob will take $55."
