"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me a slightly larger share, but still a relatively fair division of the money. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice.  An even split is the best way to start. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants an even split. That's a reasonable proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
