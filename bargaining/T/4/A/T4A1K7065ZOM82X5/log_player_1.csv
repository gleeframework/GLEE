"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a decent chunk, but I'm not being too generous""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. The message is a bit of a warning to Bob that I'm not going to give him a huge amount, but I'm not being completely unfair either."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering we both get a good amount and it's my turn to propose. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $4,000 is now worth 90% of the original $4,000, which is $3,600.

I don't think a 60/40 split is very favorable to me, considering the original amount was $10,000. I'd like to get a better deal. I'll reject this offer.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less after two rounds of inflation, the effective value of the money is now 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 of the original $10,000, which is $8,100.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm still not giving you the majority, but I'm willing to give you a bit more this round""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $5,500 and Bob gets $4,500."
