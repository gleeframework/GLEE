"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is a 60-40 split, which seems fair to me. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, which is a bit more generous than my initial offer. However, I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject this offer for now and proceed to the next round.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the previous offers and the inflation, I'll make a new proposal that's a bit more aggressive.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

This is a 70-30 split, which I hope will be more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts Bob is offering in this round:

Alice's gain: 550,000
Bob's gain: 450,000

Since Bob's gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, we can calculate the original amount as follows:

Original Bob's gain = 450,000 / (1 - 0.271) = 450,000 / 0.729 = 617,822

This means Bob is offering me approximately 550,000, which is actually less than my initial offer in round 1. I think I can do better than this.

I'll reject Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the previous offers and the inflation, I'll make a new proposal that's a bit more aggressive.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000
}
```

This is a 75-25 split, which I hope will be more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 595000 
# Bob gain: 405000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts Bob is offering in this round:

Alice's gain: 595,000
Bob's gain: 405,000

Since Bob's gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round, we can calculate the original amount as follows:

Original Bob's gain = 405,000 / (1 - 0.4095) = 405,000 / 0.5905 = 685,134

This means Bob is offering me approximately 595,000, which is still less than my initial offer in round 1. I'm starting to think Bob is trying to get a good deal.

However, considering the significant inflation and the fact that Bob's offer is still above 40% of the original amount, I'll accept this offer.
