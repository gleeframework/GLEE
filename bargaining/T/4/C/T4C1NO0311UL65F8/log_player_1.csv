I propose to take 900,000$ and give Bob 100,000$. I think this is a fair offer, as it gives Bob a decent amount while ensuring I get the majority."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm offering Bob 190,000. This is more than he got in the last round, and while it's less than he offered me, it's a fair compromise considering the inflation."
