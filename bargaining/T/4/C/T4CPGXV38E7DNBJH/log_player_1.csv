"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's new offer. Since the money is worth 10% less for Bob, I'm getting a slightly better deal than in the first round, but Bob is still getting a larger share.

I'll decide to reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob's offer in round 2 was 60-40 in his favor, I'll try to adjust the ratio in my favor. I'll offer a 55-45 split, which is a bit more in my favor.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on Bob's offer! With the money worth 27.1% less for Bob, he's getting a much smaller share than in the previous round.

I'll think carefully about this offer... Since the money is worth the same for me, I'm getting a larger share than in the previous round. I'll decide to accept this offer.
