"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it closer to the middle.  I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I still think I deserve a larger share.  This is the last chance before the money shrinks even further. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is getting closer to a fair split, it's still skewed in her favor. With the inflation rate, accepting this offer would mean I get significantly less than half the original value.  I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the next few rounds."
