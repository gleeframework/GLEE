Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable.  I understand you want a larger share, but the inflation makes your offer unsustainable long-term. This is a much fairer split considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
