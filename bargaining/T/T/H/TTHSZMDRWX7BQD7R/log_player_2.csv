"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money 60/40. It's a fair deal for the first round. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer heavily favors Alice.  While it might seem fair at first glance, the impact of inflation is significant. It's better to wait for a more balanced proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable.  I understand you want a larger share, but the inflation makes your offer unsustainable long-term. This is a much fairer split considering the circumstances.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the inflation is a factor, but so is the time pressure. Let's meet in the middle - my turn to propose a bit more. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice is clearly acknowledging the time pressure and is moving towards a more balanced offer. Accepting now secures a reasonable amount before inflation eats further into the potential gains."
