"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. 60/40 split seems reasonable for a quick agreement. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""Your offer was a bit too skewed in your favor, Alice. How about we meet closer to the middle? This deal accounts for the slight inflation disparity.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's be realistic. The inflation is eating away at your potential gains faster. I'll offer you 3700, which is a decent sum considering the circumstances.  Time to make a decision! 
# Bob gain: 3700 
# Alice gain: 6300 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is clearly trying to leverage the inflation against me. While 3700 is better than nothing, holding out a bit longer might yield a better deal even with the inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Don't underestimate my patience, Alice. This offer is fair and still benefits you considering the inflation.  Let's close this deal.""}
