I'm going to reject this offer. While it's better than nothing, I'm hoping for a more even split. Plus, with the inflation factor, there's a chance I can get a better deal later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000}
```

I'm offering a split that's closer to 50/50. I believe this is a fair starting point, given the potential for inflation."
