"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take a bit more since I'm starting""}

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40. I'm framing it as a fair split, but taking a slightly larger share since I'm starting the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split. I'm taking into account the fact that you're getting a better deal with the inflation, but I'm also trying to be reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm considering Bob's offer.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, $45 is a decent offer. However, I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll think about it...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation""}

I'm proposing that I get $70 and Bob gets $30. I'm trying to find a middle ground, but still pushing for a slightly larger share since I think I'm being reasonable given the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still trying to be fair, but I'm losing value with each round. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm considering Bob's offer.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, $60 is a decent offer. However, I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll think about it...

But, considering Bob's message, I sense that he's being more serious about this being his final offer. I don't want to risk getting a worse deal, so...
