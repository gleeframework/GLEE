Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my offer is still generous considering the time pressure. Don't be greedy. 
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is right about time pressure, I need to consider a few things:

* **Inflation:**  The value of her share is decreasing significantly with each round. This weakens her bargaining position.
* **Previous Offers:** She's consistently aimed for a larger share, and this offer isn't drastically different from her previous ones.
* **Rounds Remaining:** We still have several rounds to go.  Holding out might push her towards a more favorable split for me. 

I'm betting that Alice will become more willing to make a deal as the rounds progress and inflation continues to impact her potential gains."

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Accept this offer, or we both risk ending up with nothing! 
# Bob gain: 4900 
# Alice gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

It's finally happened - the constantly-decreasing value of her share has forced Alice to make a concession and offer me a majority of the money!  It's not by much, but every dollar counts. 

Waiting any longer is too risky. I don't know how much longer she's willing to negotiate, and if this deal falls through, we might both end up with nothing."
