Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to be greedy in the first round and try to get the lion's share.  I figure Bob will be more reasonable in the next round if I leave him with a small amount.  After all, a penny is better than nothing!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more,  Bob's offer is still a substantial amount. It's more than what I'd get in the next round, especially considering inflation. Accepting this offer is the most logical choice."
