"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, I'll take the bigger share""}

I'm proposing that I take 80% of the initial $10,000, which is $8,000, and Bob takes the remaining $2,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer since it's a decent split, and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 3:2, a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer. I was hoping for a better split, and 3:2 is still a bit too skewed in his favor. I'll reject this offer and hope to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'll meet you halfway, 3:2 is too much, but 6:4 is a fair compromise""}

I'm proposing a split of 60% to me and 40% to Bob, which is a more balanced compromise. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finally settle on a division."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, 5:5 is a fair split 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I think Bob's offer is a good one! 5:5 is a very fair split, and considering the inflation, it's a decent compromise. I'll accept this offer and we can finally divide the $10,000."
