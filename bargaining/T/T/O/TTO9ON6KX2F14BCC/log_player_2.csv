"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money fairly. I'll take 700000 and you get 300000. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
 
It's a good starting point, but I'm feeling a bit greedy. I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better. Let's try a more even split.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose an equal split to ensure fairness and mutual benefit. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

Even with the inflation, an equal split is fair. Let's end this game!"
