"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate too much""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, which is a relatively small amount, so he might be motivated to accept and end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'd like to propose a fair split, with 700000 for me and 300000 for you. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob wants to mirror my previous offer, but with the roles reversed. I'll have to think carefully about this...

I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation has taken a toll, and the money is worth less now. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I need something substantial""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a larger share this time, but I'm still trying to get a better deal for myself."
