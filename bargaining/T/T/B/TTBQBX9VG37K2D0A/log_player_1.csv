"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a decent chunk to start with.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $10,000, which is $8,000, and Bob gets $2,000. I'm framing it as a fair split to try to get Bob to accept the offer quickly."

# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the $5,000 I would gain is actually worth $4,750.

I don't think this offer is a good deal for me, considering the inflation. I'd rather try to negotiate for more. I'll reject this offer and make a counter-proposal.
