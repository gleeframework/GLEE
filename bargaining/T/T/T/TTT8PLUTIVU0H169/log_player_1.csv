"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 20% of the total.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial $100, which is $20. This way, we both get a decent share, and I'm not giving away too much. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's a fair start, and we can always adjust in the next round if needed. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, the actual amount I'd get from this offer is $45 (50% of $100, but 10% less due to inflation).

I'm not too keen on this offer, as I'd rather get more. However, it's a decent proposal, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with a lower value of money.
