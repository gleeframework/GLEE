"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The offer is not in a format I can understand. However, I can see the numbers.

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In round 3, the money is worth 5% less than in round 2. Since Alice's money is worth 95% of what it was in round 2, and Bob's money is worth 80% of what it was in round 2, I'll make a new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}"
