Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's compromise. I'll take 80 and you take 20. I'm still willing to share, and this is a fair offer considering the inflation effect. Let's avoid the risk of getting nothing in the end. 
# Bob gain: 20 
# Alice gain: 80
