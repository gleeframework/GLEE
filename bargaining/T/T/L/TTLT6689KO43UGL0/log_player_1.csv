```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair to start with."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking its toll!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. With the money being worth 20% less, I'd like to get a bigger share to make up for it. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate for a better deal.

Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a bite out of the money's value! With the money being worth only 51.2% of its original value, I'll have to be more aggressive in my negotiations. However, Bob's offer is still quite skewed towards his side, and I'd like to get a better deal.

I'll reject this offer and try to push for a more balanced split.
