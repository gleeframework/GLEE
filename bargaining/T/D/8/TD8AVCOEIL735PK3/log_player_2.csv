Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Even though Alice is claiming to ""meet in the middle,"" the deal is still heavily skewed in her favor due to inflation working against her. While she's getting a little less than before, it's still a much bigger loss for her if the game continues and the money devalues further.  We need to push for a more favorable outcome."

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take a smaller share, but I won't go below half 
# Bob gain: 460000 
# Alice gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is getting desperate, and her offers are getting worse for her due to the inflation. While she claims she won't go below half, her negotiating position weakens with every round. It's worth holding out for a better deal, as she may be forced to concede more in the next round."
