"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 40% and take the rest.""
}
```

This way, I'll get $600,000 and Bob will get $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, I'll take 60% and give you the rest. It's a better deal for both of us than the previous offer. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is indeed a better deal for me than my previous offer, and it's a fair split. I accept his offer.
