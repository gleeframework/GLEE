"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This offer gives me a large share of the money (900,000$) while still giving Bob a small amount (100,000$).  Since I don't know how inflation impacts Bob, I'm hoping this offer is attractive enough for him to accept, especially since he'll be making the next offer if he rejects this one."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though my share is much smaller, I have to accept this offer. Inflation has drastically reduced the value of the money, and if I reject this offer, I risk getting nothing in the next round.  It's better to take what I can get now."
