I propose that I receive $9,000 and Bob receives $1,000.  Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm increasing my offer to $7,000 for me and $3,000 for Bob. I think this is a fair split considering the inflation and that Bob rejected my previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6800 
# Bob gain: 3200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I would prefer a larger share, Bob's offer is getting increasingly more favorable due to inflation. It's time to take what I can get!"
