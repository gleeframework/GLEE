"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this round. We both lose value with each round, so it's in our best interest to come to an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
