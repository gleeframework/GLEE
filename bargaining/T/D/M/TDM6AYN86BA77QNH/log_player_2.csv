"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'm offering you 40% and keeping 60%. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 
This is a classic ultimatum game with the added twist of inflation. While Alice's offer seems fair on the surface, the inflation heavily favors me in later rounds. I'm willing to gamble on getting a better deal later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Thanks for the initial offer, Alice. How about we turn the tables?  Time is money, and it's depreciating fast. ""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's compromise.  Since we both want to get something, I'll lower my share slightly to 54.  Let's make this happen before the value drops further! 
# Bob gain: 46 
# Alice gain: 54 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is trying to anchor the negotiation around a favorable split for her.  The inflation works in my favor significantly more than hers, so I need to be patient and aim higher."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 65,
""alice_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""Alice, this money is practically evaporating!  I'm proposing a 65/35 split.  Let's be decisive and get this done."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're both losing money with every round. Let's meet in the middle. I'll take 45, and you get 55. This is the best deal we can get now, before things get worse. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice is right, we're both losing out the longer this goes on. While I was hoping for a slightly better split, accepting 55% now is better than risking an even lower offer from Alice in the later rounds, or even worse, walking away with nothing."
