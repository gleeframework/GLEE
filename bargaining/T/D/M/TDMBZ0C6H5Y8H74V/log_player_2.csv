Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'll give a little less 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation mechanic.  While the offer is slightly better than her last, it's still heavily skewed in her favor considering my losses are increasing each round. I need to push for a more equitable split soon before the inflation eats away too much of my potential gain."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""This is getting ridiculous.  Let's be fair and split it evenly before we both lose out.""}
