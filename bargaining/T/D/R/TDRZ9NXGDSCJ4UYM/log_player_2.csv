"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, let's compromise to minimize further loss. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Alice's offer in Round 3 is now better than my offer in Round 2 would be after another round of inflation. It's better to take a decent deal now than risk losing more to inflation."
