Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This is a pretty aggressive opening offer, but I think it's important to establish dominance early on.  I'm hoping Bob will be tempted to take this deal before the inflation kicks in too much.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly less than my initial offer, but the inflation is now a factor.  I'm still hoping to get a larger share, and I think I can do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm going to try a middle ground offer this round.  I'm hoping Bob will realize that rejecting offers will lead to both of us losing more money due to inflation, and that he might be willing to settle for something closer to a 70/30 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly worse, and I'm still losing a lot of money to inflation. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round. Even though we're losing value with each passing round, I believe I can still get a better outcome than this."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway this round. I'm hoping he'll realize that continuing to reject offers will lead to both of us getting a worse deal in the end. We're both losing value quickly, and I think a 60/40 split is a fair compromise at this point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is completely unreasonable, and I'm losing a huge amount of money due to inflation.  While I'm running out of time, I'm not going to accept such a low offer. I'm going to keep pushing for a fairer deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm going to try a 50/50 split this time. We're both losing significant value with each round, and I think this is the fairest offer I can make at this point. Bob needs to understand that rejecting further offers will only lead to both of us getting less."
