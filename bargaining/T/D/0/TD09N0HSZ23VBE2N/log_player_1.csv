"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'm willing to compromise.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a relatively fair division of the $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a better deal this time, but I'm not going to give away too much 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 95% of the original value, and Bob's gain is worth 80% of the original value.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about the 30% gain for me, but I'm willing to accept it since it's an improvement from the previous offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
