I'm going to try to be fair, but I'm also going to aim for the biggest share possible. I'm going to offer Bob $100,000 and keep $900,000 for myself. 

Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob is offering a 50/50 split, which is fair considering the inflation. It's better than risking another round and getting even less."
