I'm going to propose a slightly unfair split, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it in the first round.  Since the money is worth less in each round, I want to get as much as possible right away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I would prefer a more equal split, I'm willing to accept this offer. Due to inflation, I will earn significantly less if we go to another round.  My gains would be reduced by 5%, while Bob's would be reduced by 10%. It's better to take what I can get now."
