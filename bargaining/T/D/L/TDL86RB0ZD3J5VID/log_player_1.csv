"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm offering a 50/50 split, which seems fair to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with this offer. I was hoping for a more even split, and Bob's offer is heavily biased towards him. I'll reject this offer and hope to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 420000, ""bob_gain"": 580000}

I'm trying to make a slightly more aggressive offer, hoping to get a better deal."
