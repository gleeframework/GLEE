Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You are losing value, I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, accepting is the most logical choice for Bob. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  With each round, Bob loses a significant chunk of his potential earnings due to the 5% inflation. Waiting any longer will only result in a worse deal for him. 
* **Alice's Stance:** Alice has consistently aimed for a larger share and is unlikely to budge significantly. Her offers might even get worse for Bob.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While $420,000 is significantly less than what Bob could have gotten initially, it's better than holding out for an unlikely ideal offer and ending up with even less in a later round.

It's a tough choice, but sometimes in negotiations, you have to secure the best possible outcome under increasingly unfavorable circumstances."
