"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40, which is 40% of the total, and I'll take the remaining 60%. The message is a friendly one, hoping to start the negotiation on a positive note!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time, Alice. We'll both get more this way than we will if we keep rejecting each other's offers. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the offer from Bob's perspective. His offer is a 50-50 split, which is a fair proposal.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
