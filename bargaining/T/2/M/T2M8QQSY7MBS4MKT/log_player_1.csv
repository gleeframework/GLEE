"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is 20% of the total amount. This is a relatively small amount, so I'm hoping Bob will see the fairness in this offer and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Split it down the middle for now, see what you think 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to be reasonable and split the money down the middle. However, I'm not sure I want to give up $5,000 just yet. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob was willing to split it down the middle, I'll try to negotiate from there. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is 40% of the total amount. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I'm not going to give up too much ground 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to squeeze me out and take a larger share. I'm not happy about this, but I don't want to risk going to the next round. I'll accept the offer, but I'm not thrilled about it.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
