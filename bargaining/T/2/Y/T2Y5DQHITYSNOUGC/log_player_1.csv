"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair to split the money in a way that reflects my risk of rejecting your previous offer.  Let's go for 60/40. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting twist! Considering the inflation effect, I'll have to be careful with my decision.

Since the money is worth 5% less for me now, I'd like to propose a counteroffer that takes this into account. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the 60/40 split, especially considering the inflation. Can we discuss a more balanced split?""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and suggesting we discuss further. It's my turn to make the next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money. Since the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, I'll aim for a slightly higher share to compensate. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to take a slightly higher share, but I'm still open to negotiations""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: With inflation, I'm willing to compromise and accept a 50/50 split. Let's end this and both get something. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is willing to meet me halfway now. Considering the significant impact of inflation on the money's value, I think a 50/50 split is a reasonable compromise. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, let's end this and split it 50/50. It's better than going further down the inflation rabbit hole!""
}
```

I accept Bob's offer and we can finally conclude the game!"
