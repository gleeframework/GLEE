Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. This gives me a slight advantage understanding the impact of inflation, but ensures you get a good chunk too.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your logic, but your offer is too low considering the rate at which my share loses value. This is a compromise - it gives me a bit more security while still being a good deal for you. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation rate, and her offers are getting better for Bob. While closer, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. Rejecting this keeps the pressure on her and gives Bob a strong position to negotiate from in the next round."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's stop wasting time.  A 50/50 split is the fairest outcome.  We both know the longer this goes on, the less we'll both get. Let's be sensible. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** 

While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:**  With each round, the value of the money significantly decreases, especially for Alice. This puts pressure on *both* of you to reach an agreement.
* **Fairness:**  Although Bob held out for a better deal, 50/50 is objectively fair. It's unlikely Alice will agree to anything significantly better for Bob at this point.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a slightly better deal in later rounds carries the very real risk of getting nothing if negotiations completely fall apart. 

Accepting the 50/50 split guarantees Bob a reasonable share before inflation eats away too much of the potential winnings."
