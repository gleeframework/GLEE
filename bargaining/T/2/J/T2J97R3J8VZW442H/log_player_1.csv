"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting 60 dollars and Bob getting 40 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting strong, but I think I can do better! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of 20 dollars is now worth 18 dollars (90% of 20).

I don't think I can do better than this offer, so I'll accept.
