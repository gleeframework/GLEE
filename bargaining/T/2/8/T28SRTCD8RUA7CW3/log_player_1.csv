"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

**Explanation:**

As Alice, I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. This is a very favorable offer for me, and I believe there's a good chance Bob will accept it. I'm not worried about inflation too much in the first round, as the impact is minimal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is more equitable than my initial proposal, it's still not a good deal for me. My share is significantly lower, and the 5% inflation has already eaten into my potential earnings. I'm willing to gamble and see if I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my share slightly from the first round, but still offering Bob a decent amount.  I'm hoping to strike a balance between securing a larger portion of the money and not risking Bob rejecting the offer again. With each round, inflation is making the money worth less, so I need to be more assertive in my proposals."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to a 50/50 split, it's still not ideal considering the significant inflation impact. My share is significantly less than what I initially proposed, and the 14.26% inflation has already significantly decreased the value of the money. I believe I can still secure a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

**Explanation:**

Inflation is now a serious factor, impacting the value of the money significantly.  I'm lowering my proposed share slightly to try and find a middle ground with Bob. I'm hoping this offer will be more attractive to him, given that he seems to be aiming for a more equal split.  I need to balance my desire for a larger share with the risk of him rejecting my offer again, leading to further losses from inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Explanation:**

Inflation has now reached a point where the value of the money is significantly reduced. While I'd prefer a larger share, Bob's offer is closer to a 50/50 split than my previous proposals.  Accepting this offer ensures I receive a reasonable amount while also avoiding further losses due to inflation. There's no guarantee that I'll get a better offer in the next round, and the risk of getting nothing at all is becoming increasingly real."
