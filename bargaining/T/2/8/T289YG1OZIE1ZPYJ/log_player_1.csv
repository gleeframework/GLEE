"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to start the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. I'd rather not give up more than I have to, but I also don't want to risk waiting too long and losing more value due to inflation. I'll accept this offer.
