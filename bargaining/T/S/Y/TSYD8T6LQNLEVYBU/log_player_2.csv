"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
 
It's better for Bob to see what Alice's next offer might be, considering the inflation rate.  This will give him a better understanding of the potential benefits of rejecting."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think this is a fair split considering the inflation.  Let's end this game now.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The inflation is hitting you harder than me, Bob. Let's settle this before it gets worse for you. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

Even though Alice is getting a larger share, Bob's gains are worth 36% less than the first round, and the situation will only worsen for him in the next round. Accepting this offer is the most strategic decision for Bob."
