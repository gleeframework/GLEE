"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but it's a fair deal considering the risk of inflation. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can split the money quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split this evenly. We both get a fair share, and we don't have to risk losing everything as the rounds go on. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less for me, I need to be more cautious. Bob's offer is a good one, and I don't want to risk losing even more value in future rounds. I think I'll accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
