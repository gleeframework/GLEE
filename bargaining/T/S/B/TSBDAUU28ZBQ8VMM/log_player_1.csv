"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1} 
```

This is a classic negotiation tactic! I'm aiming for the majority of the money, knowing that Bob may be tempted to accept even a small amount rather than risk getting nothing in the next round due to inflation.  Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While I'm getting something, it's still a very small amount compared to the original offer I made.  I'm confident that I can negotiate a better deal in the next round.  Inflation is working in my favor, and I'm not afraid to let Bob know that I'm not settling for crumbs!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly, but still aiming for a significant portion of the money.  Bob rejected my previous offer and is likely feeling the pressure of inflation.  He might be more willing to compromise this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'm still getting less than I originally wanted, the inflation is starting to take its toll on Bob's gains. It's better to take the $10 now than risk getting even less in the next round. It's time to cash in!"
