"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. This way we both get a decent amount.""}

I'm proposing a 60:40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time, Alice. It's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not convinced by Bob's offer. I'd like to make a counteroffer. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""I'm not sure an even split is the best option. I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share. How about 5500 for me and 4500 for you?""}

I'm trying to negotiate for a slightly better deal, while still being open to a compromise."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm sticking to my guns, Bob. I think this is a fair compromise. You can't expect me to take the short end of the stick forever!""}

I'm sticking to my previous counteroffer, hoping Bob will accept this time around."
