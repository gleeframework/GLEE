I'm going to start by being generous and offering Bob a small portion of the money.  I want to see if he's willing to accept a quick and easy deal, or if he's going to try to push for more."

Bob is getting increasingly greedy, and the inflation is only making the situation worse. I'm not going to accept his offer. I'm going to keep trying to negotiate a more reasonable split.  I'm starting to get worried about the dwindling rounds, but I'm not going to let Bob bully me into accepting an unfair deal."
