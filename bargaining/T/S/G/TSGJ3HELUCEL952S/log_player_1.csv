I'm going for a pretty hefty share in the first round.  Let's see if Bob is feeling generous!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

While I'd prefer to have more, it's unlikely Bob will offer me more in future rounds. Accepting this ensures a fair split and avoids the risk of getting nothing due to inflation."
