"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point!""}

I'm proposing that I receive $600,000 and Bob receives $400,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and it gives us both a good chunk of the money to work with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with Bob's offer. He's trying to take a larger share of the money, and I don't think it's fair. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal. I'll propose a new offer in the next round."

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I'll compromise and give you a slightly larger share, but I still think 45-55 is a fairer split.""}

I'm trying to find a middle ground by giving Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping a significant portion for myself. I hope Bob will consider this offer and accept it."

# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with Bob's offer. The 9:1 split is extremely unfair, and I don't think it's a reasonable compromise. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need a more balanced split. I'll propose a new offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.

# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with Bob's offer at all. The 50000 I would get is a tiny fraction of the original amount, and I don't think it's a fair deal. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need a much better offer than this. I'll propose a new offer in the next round."
