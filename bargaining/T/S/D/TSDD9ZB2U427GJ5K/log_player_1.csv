"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to start."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 5% less, I need to consider the relative values.

My initial proposal was a 50-50 split, but Bob's offer is now a 40-60 split. Considering the inflation, I think I should accept this offer to avoid further negotiations and get a slightly better deal than the initial 50-50 split.
