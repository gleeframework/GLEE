"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is a fair offer for us to start. What do you think, Bob? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While this is a ""fair"" offer in the sense of the numbers, it's not in my best interest as Bob.  Since the money inflates for Alice, I should try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I believe this is a fairer split, considering the inflation we both face. Let's end this quickly and get our share!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but your offer doesn't account for the decreasing value for me. This offer is a compromise, and it's better to settle now before the money is worth even less. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

Alice's offer is a fair compromise, and considering the inflation rate, it's better to accept and avoid further rounds where the money might be worth even less."
