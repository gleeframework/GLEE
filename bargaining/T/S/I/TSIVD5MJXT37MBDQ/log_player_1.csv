"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe this is a fairer split, considering the inflation we both face. Let's end this quickly and get our share! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

Let's think about this strategically. While Bob's offer is tempting, accepting it now means I agree to a worse deal than my initial proposal. It's clear Bob understands the impact of inflation, so he's trying to push for a better outcome for himself. 

I need to make a counter-offer that reflects the changing value of the money but also incentivizes Bob to settle sooner rather than later.  We'll see if he's truly interested in a fair deal."
