# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'd like to proceed to the next round to try to negotiate a better split. With the inflation rates in mind, I think I can get a more favorable offer. Let's see what happens next!"

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the inflation pressures, but your offer was too low. I'm willing to compromise, but let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'll reject this offer as well. Given the increasing impact of inflation, especially on Alice's side, I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the next rounds. The pressure is higher on Alice due to the higher inflation rate affecting her share, so I'll try to leverage that in the next round."
