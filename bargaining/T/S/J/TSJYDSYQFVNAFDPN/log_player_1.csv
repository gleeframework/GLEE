Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

Let's see if Bob is happy with a 90/10 split.  I'm feeling generous in the first round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, with the inflation and the risk of getting nothing,  I'll accept Bob's offer."
