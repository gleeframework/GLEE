Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is feeling the pressure of inflation more strongly now. While her offer is closer to a more even split, I believe she might be willing to concede further in the next round or two.  I'm aiming for a slightly better deal than this."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's end this now and split it evenly.  A fair deal saves us both time and money.""} 

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a 50/50 split.  Here's why:

* **Fairness:** It's a clean and easily justifiable split, removing any argument about who's being greedy.
* **Time Pressure:**  We're past the halfway point.  The longer this drags on, the less attractive any deal becomes for Alice due to inflation.
* **Potential for Rejection:**  While I believe Alice is feeling the pressure, pushing for a heavily weighted split in my favor could backfire, leading to her rejecting the offer out of principle.  

This offer balances risk and potential reward at this stage."
