# Alice's message: Come on, let's meet in the middle 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still hoping to get a better deal.  The inflation is starting to hurt, but I think I can still get a better offer later on."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""This is my final offer. If you reject it, we'll both lose more money in the next round.""}

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

The inflation is starting to hit hard.  I'm not going to get a better deal, and if I reject again, I'll lose even more money.  It's time to take the deal."
