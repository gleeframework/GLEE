"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This offer gives me a large share, but still leaves something for Bob. It's a fair starting point, and I'm hoping he'll accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would have preferred to get more, the inflation makes it risky to continue.  Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, and it's better than getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
