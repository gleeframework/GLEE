Let's see if Bob agrees with this offer!  I'm hoping to get a good chunk of the money, but I'm also considering that the money will be worth less in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

While I'd prefer to get more money, I'm not sure if I can get a better deal in the next round.  The inflation is starting to hurt, and Bob's offer is at least fair."
