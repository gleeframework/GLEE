"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```
I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced values due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully. My gain of 7000 is now worth 0.95 * 7000 = 6650, and Bob's gain of 3000 is now worth 0.8 * 3000 = 2400.

I'll reject this offer. I'd rather wait for a better deal.

Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

I'm trying to be a bit more generous this time, but still keeping a slight edge."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the values in Round 4. My gain of 5500 is now worth 0.9526 * 5500 = 5231.3, and Bob's gain of 4500 is now worth 0.5168 * 4500 = 2324.8.

I'll reject this offer. I'd rather wait for a better deal.
