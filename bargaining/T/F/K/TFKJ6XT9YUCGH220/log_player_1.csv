"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, which I think is a reasonable starting point for negotiations. The message ""Let's be fair"" is an attempt to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. I think that's the fairest way to do this. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth the same to me as in the first round, and I initially offered a 60-40 split in my favor, I don't see a reason to accept an even split. I will reject this offer in hopes of getting a better deal in the next round.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to negotiate, but I still think I deserve a bit more.""}\n\nIn this round, I've increased my proposed share to 65%, while decreasing Bob's share to 35%. My message indicates that I'm open to negotiation, but I still believe I deserve a larger share. Since the money is worth the same to me as in the first round, I'm trying to take advantage of Bob's decreasing valuation of the money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I can't go lower than $4000. Let's split the difference from last round. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI've decided to accept Bob's offer in this round. Since the money is worth the same to me as in the first round, I'm essentially getting the same amount I initially proposed ($6000). Meanwhile, the money is worth 48.8% less to Bob, making his $4000 offer less valuable than it would have been in the first round. Given that I'm not likely to get a better offer from Bob in future rounds, I'm choosing to accept this compromise and end the game."
