"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair split - 90% for me, 10% for you.  Let's get this over with quickly! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible deal for Bob! While getting something is better than nothing, Alice's offer significantly undervalues Bob's position in the game.  The threat of inflation will hopefully push Alice towards a more reasonable offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm offering you 4000. Considering the inflation, a deal now is better than risking getting nothing later.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise.  Let's split it 60/40, acknowledging the inflation.  This is still a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is finally moving in the right direction, but this is still not a good deal for Bob. The inflation hurts her much more than it hurts him, and she'll be feeling the pressure soon.  Bob can afford to be a bit more patient and see if she'll propose something closer to even in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking, and every round makes this less appealing for both of us.  I'm offering a 55/45 split. Let's close this deal and avoid losing any more to inflation.""}"
