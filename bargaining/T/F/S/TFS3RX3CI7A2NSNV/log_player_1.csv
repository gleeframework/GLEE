Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a fair split to see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a more even split, I'm accepting this offer.  The inflation rate is too significant to risk another round and potentially lose more."
