Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise and give you a larger share, but I still want to keep some for myself. This way, we both get a decent amount, and the inflation rates are considered. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
