I propose to keep 900,000$ for myself, and give Bob 100,000$. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the inflation factor that only affects me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I propose a 50/50 split.  Since the inflation has now impacted me twice, a 50/50 split feels fair.  We both get an equal amount, and I can at least recover some of the losses I've incurred."
