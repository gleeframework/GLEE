"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Alice will receive 10% less value with each passing round, I'll try to make a more advantageous offer. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting that Alice is now proposing a 50/50 split. Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, but the money Alice gains is worth less due to inflation, I'll accept her offer.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
