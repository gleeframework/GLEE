Let's see if Bob is happy with a 90/10 split!  I'm aiming for the majority share since the money will be worth less to me in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I'd prefer more, it's better to take the $6,000 now than risk getting nothing in the next round.  The inflation is hitting hard!"
