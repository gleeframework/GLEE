Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic.  My previous offer was much fairer considering the inflation. I'm willing to come down slightly to $5,700 for me and $4,300 for you.  This is a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700
