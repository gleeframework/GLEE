Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, the time constraint and the fact that Bob is offering a reasonable 60/40 split, makes this offer more appealing. It's better to get 4000$ than nothing."
