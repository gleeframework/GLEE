"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and straightforward offer. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or reject my offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'm not being generous! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my share of $20 is worth 10% less than the $50 I would have gotten in the first round, so it's equivalent to $18 in ""old money"".

I'm not thrilled with this offer, but I'm not getting any younger. I'll accept Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
