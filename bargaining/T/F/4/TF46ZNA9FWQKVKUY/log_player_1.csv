"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""I'll take all the money, but I'll give you a nice cake!""
}
```

Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90, you take 10. We can work from there. 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less after the first round, the actual offer is:

* Alice gain: 8 (10 * 0.8)
* Bob gain: 72 (90 * 0.8)

I'll accept this offer.
