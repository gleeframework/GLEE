Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want this. Let's just split it evenly and call it a day. This is the best offer you'll get considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd still prefer a larger share, the inflation is making it increasingly difficult to get a better deal. Accepting a 50/50 split is the most logical choice at this point."
