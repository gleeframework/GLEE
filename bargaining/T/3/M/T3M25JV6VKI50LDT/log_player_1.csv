I'm going to start with a fairly balanced offer, aiming for a quick resolution.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While Bob's offer isn't great, the inflation means taking it is probably the best choice. My share is worth less, and it's likely Bob will offer even less in the next round."
