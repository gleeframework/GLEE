"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. This way, we both get a fair share. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not sure why Bob is proposing an even split now, after rejecting my initial offer. I was thinking of a 60-40 split, and now he's suggesting a 50-50 split? It seems like he's trying to take advantage of the fact that my gains are worth the same as in the first round, while his gains are worth 20% less. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more""}

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than the initial 60-40 split, but still a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair deal given the inflation. We both get a decent amount, and it's better than getting nothing in the next round! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, especially since my gains are still worth the same as in the first round, while his gains are worth significantly less due to inflation. I think I deserve more considering the current situation. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a small share, but I think I deserve the majority""}

I'm proposing a 80-20 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than the previous offers. I'm trying to take advantage of the fact that my gains are still worth the same as in the first round, while Bob's gains are worth less due to inflation."
