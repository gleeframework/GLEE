"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
```

I propose a split of $9000 for me and $1000 for Bob. This is a relatively generous offer in the first round, hoping to secure a quick agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is better than nothing, the 5% inflation on my potential gain is significant, and the fact that Bob received a 10% inflation penalty suggests he's in a worse position. I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I propose a split of $7000 for me and $3000 for Bob.  This is a more balanced offer, considering the inflation we both experienced. It also leaves room for negotiation in the next round if necessary."
