Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going for a slightly unfair but not too aggressive offer. It's good to start with a bit of a lead, but I want to see if Bob is willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I initially aimed for a larger share, the inflation has significantly impacted Bob's offer. He's offering an even split, which is a fair outcome considering the diminishing value of the money. Accepting this offer ensures I secure a decent share before further inflation devalues my gains."
