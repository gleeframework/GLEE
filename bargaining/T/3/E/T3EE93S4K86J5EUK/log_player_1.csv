"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can always counteroffer if you want more.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll see it as a fair starting point and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a small share, but I think I deserve more since I'm the one making the offer. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","In the second round, the money is worth 20% less, so my gain of $200,000 is actually $160,000.

I'm not thrilled with the offer, but I'm willing to accept it since it's still a better deal than the original offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
