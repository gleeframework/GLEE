"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can reassess later.""}

I'm proposing that I receive $8,000 and Bob receives $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle, it's a fair starting point. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 50/50 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my expectations.
