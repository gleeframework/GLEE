Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose a 95/5 split, where I take 95 dollars and Bob takes 5 dollars.  It's a pretty good deal for me, but hopefully, Bob will see it as a better deal than getting nothing in the next round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share,  it's better to take what I can get now. If I reject, the money I gain in the next round will be even less."
