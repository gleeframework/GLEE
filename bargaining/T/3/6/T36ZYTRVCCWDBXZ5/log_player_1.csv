I propose that I get $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000.  I'm being generous in this first round, hoping he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer. While the money is worth less now, I can still do better in the next round. I'm confident that I can secure a more favorable deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
``` 

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself.  Since the money is worth less now, I'm willing to give him a slightly bigger share, but I still believe I can get the majority."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I accept this offer. While my share is significantly less than what I initially hoped for, the inflation has made this a fair deal for both of us. It's better to take a 50/50 split now than risk getting nothing in future rounds."
