Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: Considering inflation, I'm being generous!

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Last chance, the deal won't get better for you! 
# Bob gain: 410000 
# Alice gain: 590000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a tough spot. Let's analyze:

* **Current Offer:** $410,000 is significantly less than the initial offer, but it's better than nothing.
* **Another Rejection:** If I reject, there's no guarantee Alice will offer anything better, and the value will decrease even further for me.
* **Time Value:** Waiting any longer significantly hurts my potential gains.

It's a gamble, but the risk of getting nothing is too high.
