"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

This offer gives me a large portion of the money, as I'm the one making the proposal first, and inflation will start impacting the money more heavily for Bob if he rejects the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While the offer is tempting, I'm still in a better position since I'm the one who can make the next proposal. If I reject, I can make a counter-offer, and inflation will further disadvantage Bob, incentivizing him to accept a more equitable offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm reducing my share slightly to account for the fact that Bob rejected my previous offer. This offers a significant increase from his previous offer, and I'm hoping the increasing inflation will motivate him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my previous offer. While inflation is working against me, I'm still better off rejecting and making a counter-offer in the next round. My position will improve due to inflation, and Bob will be increasingly motivated to accept a more equitable offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm further reducing my share to account for the continued rejections. While inflation is a factor, I believe a slightly higher offer than Bob's previous offer will be more appealing than continuing to stall."
