"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose to take 95$ and leave Bob with 5$.  This is a fair starting point, as I am taking the majority share, but leaving something for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, accepting this offer is the best strategy. With inflation, the money I gain is worth less, making Bob's offer more appealing. It's better to secure 40% now than risk getting less in the future."
