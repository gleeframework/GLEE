Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than an even split. Let's start with a 60/40 split in my favor, since the money is worth more to me right now.  We can adjust the split in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
