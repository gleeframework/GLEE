"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the initial $100, and Bob gets 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, but I'm still interested in getting a fair share. Since Bob's offer is 50-50, I'll accept it.
