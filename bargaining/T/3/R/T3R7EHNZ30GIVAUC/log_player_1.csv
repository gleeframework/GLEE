"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be rational""}\n\nThis proposal gives me, Alice, $600,000 and Bob $400,000. I've included a message suggesting that we be rational, implying that this division is fair and reasonable, and that prolonging the game would only result in a loss for Bob due to the 5% decrease in value each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split. Let's move on! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject Bob's offer because it gives me less than what I initially proposed, and considering the inflation doesn't affect my gain, I have no incentive to accept a lower amount than what I initially suggested. Furthermore, since the money is worth 5% less for Bob with each passing round, waiting might pressure Bob into offering a more favorable split in the future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 610000, ""bob_gain"": 390000, ""message"": ""Inflation is costly, let's settle""}\n\nIn this round, I've slightly increased my share to $610,000, while decreasing Bob's share to $390,000. My message emphasizes the impact of inflation, hinting that with each passing round, Bob's potential gain decreases in value, making it advantageous for him to accept this offer rather than risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds."
