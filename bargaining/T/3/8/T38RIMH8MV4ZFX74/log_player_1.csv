Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This leaves a good amount for Bob, while also ensuring I get a decent share.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

A 50/50 split is a fair offer, and with inflation eating away at the value, it's better to accept and secure a decent share now rather than risk getting less in future rounds."
