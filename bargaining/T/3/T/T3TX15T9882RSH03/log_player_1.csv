"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 40% of the money, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the money, which is $400,000, and I'll take the remaining 60% for myself, which is $600,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started with 60%, I'm offering 70%. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $600,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, which is $540,000, and Bob's gain of $400,000 is now worth 95% of its original value, which is $380,000.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'm not sure if I want to accept a 70% split, as it's even less favorable to me than the 60% I initially proposed. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my gain of $540,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, which is $486,000, and Bob's gain of $380,000 is now worth 95% of its original value, which is $361,000.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more due to the initial 60% I offered. Let's try to find a compromise.""
}
```

I'm now offering Bob 45% of the money, which is $450,000, and I'll take the remaining 55% for myself, which is $550,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're closer to my initial 40% offer, but I think I deserve a bit more. I'm willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $540,000 is now worth 72.9% of its original value, which is $389,400, and Bob's gain of $400,000 is now worth 86.74% of its original value, which is $346,960.

Considering Bob's new offer, I see that he's trying to push me back to the 40% split, which is not favorable to me. However, I also see that I'm getting closer to my initial 60% offer, and I don't want to give up more.

I'll accept this offer, as it's not significantly worse than my previous offer, and it's closer to the original amount I was willing to accept.
