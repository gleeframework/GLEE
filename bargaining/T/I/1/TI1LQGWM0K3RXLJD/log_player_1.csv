"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can reassess later.""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount, and I'm giving Bob a chance to accept and end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle and reassess later. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I still get $70, but for Bob, the money is worth 5% less, so he gets $47.50.

I'm not too happy about this offer, as I was hoping to get more. I'll reject it and make a new proposal. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is still worth the same for me, I'll try to get a better deal. I'll offer a slightly higher amount to Bob, but still keep a decent amount for myself.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""You're getting a better deal this time, but I'm not giving away all my share!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal this time, but I'm not going to give up too much more. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts:

My gain is still $70, worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's gain is $45, but it's worth 14.26% less than the $30 he would have gotten in the first round. So, the actual amount Bob gets is $30 / (1 - 0.1426) = $30 / 0.8574 = $34.98.

I'm not thrilled about this offer, as I was hoping to get more. I'll reject it and make a new proposal.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is still worth the same for me, I'll try to get a better deal. I'll offer a slightly higher amount to Bob, but still keep a decent amount for myself.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""You're getting closer to a fair deal, but I'm not giving up my share yet!""
}
```

Note that I'm offering the same amount to Bob as he offered in the previous round, but I'm keeping the same amount for myself. Let's see if he accepts this time!"
