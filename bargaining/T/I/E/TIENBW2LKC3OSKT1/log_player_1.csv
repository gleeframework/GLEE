"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm offering to split the $1,000,000 evenly between us, with each of us getting $500,000. This is a straightforward and fair offer, and I hope Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but you still have to compromise 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $400,000 is worth 95% of the original $500,000, or $380,000, and Bob's gain of $600,000 is worth 80% of the original $500,000, or $400,000.

I'm not sure I want to accept an offer that gives Bob a larger share of the money, especially since he rejected my initial 50/50 offer. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a better deal, but I'm not going to take less than 60%!""
}
```

Now it's my turn to make a proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth 10% of its original value due to inflation. My gain is worth 95% of 95% of the original $500,000, or $0.95 * $0.95 * $500,000 = $452,500, and Bob's gain is worth 80% of 80% of the original $500,000, or $0.8 * $0.8 * $500,000 = $320,000.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a 40% share, but I think I deserve more""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 40% share, but I'm hoping he'll see that I'm making a compromise to try to get a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not willing to give up too much 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value! In round 4, my gain of $450,000 is worth 45.25% of the original $500,000, or $225,125, and Bob's gain of $550,000 is worth 55% of the original $500,000, or $275,000.

I'm not thrilled about accepting an offer that still gives Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of the time limit and the decreasing value of the money. I'll accept this offer, hoping that Bob will stick to his word and we can finally settle the division of the money.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Okay, I'll accept this deal, but let's hope it's the last offer""
}
