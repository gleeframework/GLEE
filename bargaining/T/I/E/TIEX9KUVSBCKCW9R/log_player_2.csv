"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal. I take $60, you take $40. It's important to settle this quickly because the value of the money decreases with each round.

# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, your offer was a bit unfair. Let's split the difference from your offer -  55 for me and 45 for you. The money is losing value for both of us, so let's settle this now.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable. I understand you want a good deal, but the longer this goes on, the less the money will be worth, especially for me. A 50/50 split is fair and avoids further losses. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
