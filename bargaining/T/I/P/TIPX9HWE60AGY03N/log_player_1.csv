"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60-40""
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the original $100, and Bob will get 40%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this fair offer and we can end the game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's only fair that we split it 60-40, with me getting the bigger share since you didn't accept my offer last round. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't think it's fair that Bob is trying to take advantage of the fact that I didn't accept his previous offer. I'll reject this offer and try to make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not fair, I don't want to be penalized for not accepting your previous offer""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is still worth the same for me, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the fact that Bob's money is worth 20% less now.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's compromise and split it 50-50""
}
```"
