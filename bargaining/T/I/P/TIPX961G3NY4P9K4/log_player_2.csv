I'm not happy with Alice's initial offer.  While it seems fair at first glance, it doesn't take into account the different inflation rates. I need to see how this plays out over the rounds to make the best decision."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to split the money a bit more in your favor this round, but I think a more even split will be better for both of us long-term, considering the inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm willing to give you a bit more than last time, but I still think I deserve the larger share. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still not happy with this offer. Even though Alice is offering me a bit more, it's still significantly less than what I'd get if we split the money more evenly.  The inflation is hurting Alice much more than it's hurting me, and I'm sure she'll realize that soon.  I'm going to keep pushing for a fairer split."
