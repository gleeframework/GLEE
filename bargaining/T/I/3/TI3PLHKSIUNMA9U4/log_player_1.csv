"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\nI'll start by offering a fairly even split, with a slight bias towards myself to account for the fact that I'm making the first offer. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable starting point and we can avoid too many rounds of negotiation, which would erode the value of the money due to inflation. Fingers crossed!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nBob's offer is far too skewed in his favor, especially considering the impact of inflation on my potential earnings. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to find a more equitable split. The fact that Bob is trying to strong-arm me with a ""take it or leave it"" message only strengthens my resolve to negotiate further. Bring on the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle""}\n\nIn this round, I'll try to find a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a slightly more favorable split to compensate for the loss of value in the next rounds. I'll also try to keep the tone conciliatory, encouraging Bob to accept this offer and end the game before the inflation eats away too much of the money's value. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and we can wrap up the game soon!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer.  Let's close this out. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on my potential earnings, I think it's time to accept Bob's offer. While it's not the most favorable split for me, the fact that the money's value is decreasing rapidly with each round means that holding out for a better deal might ultimately leave me with less than I'd get from accepting this offer. Bob's message suggests that he's unwilling to negotiate further, so I'll take the 400,000 and end the game before the inflation erodes the value of the money any further. It's not a perfect outcome, but it's better than risking a worse deal or getting nothing at all!"
