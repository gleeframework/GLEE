Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a larger share this time, but I'll still give you a decent chunk. Let's see how you like it. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While he's offering a ""decent chunk"", it's still a significant decrease from the previous round. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for such a drastic drop in my share just yet."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Let's try a more balanced split this time. We both need to make compromises to reach an agreement. I'm willing to go down a bit, but I need to see some effort from your side as well.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not going to give away too much. You need to meet me halfway. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer represents a step back towards a more even split, it's still significantly lower than the previous round. The inflation is eating away at my gains, and I need to see a bigger change in Bob's offer to make it worthwhile. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I won't be rushed into an unfair deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to come down to 600,000, but I'm not going any lower. We're losing money with each passing round, so we need to find a solution quickly. Let's meet in the middle this time.""}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you in the middle this time. Let's split it 50/50 and end this game. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the inflation has significantly reduced the value of my potential gains, it's clear that Bob is also feeling the pressure. A 50/50 split, while not ideal given the initial imbalance, is the best we can achieve at this point. I'm accepting the offer to avoid further losses and secure a decent share of the remaining money."
