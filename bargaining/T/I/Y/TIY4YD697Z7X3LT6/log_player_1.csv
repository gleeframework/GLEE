"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll give you a fair share, but don't expect me to go easy on you!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split, giving me a slightly larger share, but still a generous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. 50/50 split seems like the most reasonable way to start. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation taking a bite out of my potential gain, I need to be more cautious. A 50-50 split is a reasonable offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll reject it for now and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the value of money decreasing, I'll try to take a slightly more aggressive approach. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting the better deal, Bob! I'm willing to compromise, but don't expect me to give up too much.""
}
```"
