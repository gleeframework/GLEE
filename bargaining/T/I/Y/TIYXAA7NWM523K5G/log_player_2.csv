"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal quickly, Bob. Time is money, literally! 
# Bob gain: 15 
# Alice gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not happy with only getting 15 dollars out of 100. I think I can do better than that. Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Alice, I think this is a more reasonable split. You're losing 20% value each round, so it's in your interest to accept this offer.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. This is my final offer before the money shrinks even more. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}
I'm not satisfied with Alice's offer. Given that the money's value is decreasing significantly for her with each round, I believe she has a strong incentive to settle sooner rather than later. I'll wait for the next round, anticipating a more favorable offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Alice, considering the significant decrease in value for you with each passing round, I think this offer is more than fair. It's in your best interest to accept before the money loses even more value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is ridiculous.  Let's split it evenly and end this charade. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI'm accepting Alice's offer. Given that I've been pushing for a higher share and she has been losing significant value with each round, her willingness to split it evenly at this point is a reasonable compromise. Continuing further might risk her becoming more entrenched or the value dropping even more significantly for her, making a favorable agreement less likely. This seems like a fair and strategic point to conclude the negotiations."
