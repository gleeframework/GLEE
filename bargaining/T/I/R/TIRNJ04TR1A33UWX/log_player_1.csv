Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40, which is a generous 40% of the total, while I'll take $60, which is 60% of the total."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Split it down the middle, no need to negotiate! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Bob is offering a 50-50 split, I'll have to accept this offer. The money is worth less due to inflation, but it's still a fair split.
