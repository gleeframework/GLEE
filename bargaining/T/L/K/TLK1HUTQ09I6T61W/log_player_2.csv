Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out and the inflation is eating away at our potential gains.  This offer is a compromise, and it's better to take a decent deal now than risk getting nothing later. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
