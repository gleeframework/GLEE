Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your offers are getting worse, considering the inflation. I'm willing to compromise, but not at the cost of my own gain. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While the money I gain is worth significantly less than in the first round, it's better than nothing. I don't see a better outcome if I reject this offer and risk getting even less in the next round."
