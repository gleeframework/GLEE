"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. My message is a straightforward one, suggesting that we split the money fairly and avoid any unnecessary negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, no need to overthink it! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 5% less, the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: 5000 x 0.95 = 4750
Bob gain: 5000 x 0.95 = 4750

I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 2.
