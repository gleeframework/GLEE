60.0,40.0,"Let's be fair, Bob. I propose a 60/40 split to get us started.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
35.0,65.0,"I think we can do better. I'm willing to offer you a 65/35 split.  This is more fair in my opinion, and it's still a good deal for both of us. Let's get this done.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
68.0,32.0,"Bob, time is running out and the value is decreasing. My last offer was already generous, but I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share to settle this quickly. 68/32, take it or leave it.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
30.0,70.0,"Alice, we're getting closer to the deadline, and the money is losing value for both of us.  Let's be realistic. I'm offering you 30, and I'll take 70. It's a fair split, and I believe it's the best we can both get at this point.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
75.0,25.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous. The value is plummeting with each round.  I'm offering you 25, take it before it shrinks even further. This is my final offer.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
25.0,75.0,"Alice, we're both losing money with every round. It's time to be practical. I'm offering you 25 and I'll take 75. It's a fair split given the current value of the money, and it's the best option we have.  Let's avoid losing more.",Bob,6,

70.0,30.0,"Bob, I'm trying to be reasonable, but you're leaving me no choice. 70/30.  Accept it, or we both risk walking away with nothing.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
20.0,80.0,"Alice, we're running out of time.  I'm offering you 20, and I'll take 80.  This is the best deal you'll get at this point.  We're both losing money every round.  Let's end this before it's too late.",Bob,8,

80.0,20.0,"Bob, this is absurd! I'm offering you a highly generous 20% just to end this before we both lose everything. Take it or leave it!",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
10.0,90.0,"Alice, we're in the final stretch now. The money is losing value rapidly.  I'm offering you 10, and I'll take 90. It's the best we can both do to salvage something before it's all gone.  It's time to be realistic and end this.",Bob,10,
