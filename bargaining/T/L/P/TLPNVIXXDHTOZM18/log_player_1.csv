"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I'm going to propose a 900,000 to 100,000 split. I think this is a fair offer that gives me a large portion of the money, but still leaves something for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
This is a terrible offer! Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation. I'm going to reject this and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I'm going to lower my share slightly to 850,000, but I'm still aiming for a good portion of the money.  Bob might be more willing to accept this offer as it's better than the 100,000 he was offered last round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still trying to take advantage of inflation, but I'm not going to accept this offer. It's still too low, and I'm not willing to settle for such a small share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

I'm going to lower my share again to 750,000. This is a significant compromise, but I need to offer something that's more appealing to Bob.  He's been increasingly greedy, and this might be the best chance to reach an agreement before the inflation eats away at our potential gains."
