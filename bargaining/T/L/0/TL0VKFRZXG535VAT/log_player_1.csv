This offer gives me a slight advantage while still being reasonable enough for Bob to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, Alice. This is a good deal for you considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

While Bob presents his offer as generous, it actually leaves me with a much smaller portion than my initial offer to him.  I'm willing to negotiate, but not under these terms."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Okay Bob, let's meet in the middle. This is a compromise.""
}
``` 

I'm offering a compromise by slightly adjusting my initial offer to meet Bob closer to his proposal. This shows I'm willing to negotiate while still aiming for a reasonable share."
