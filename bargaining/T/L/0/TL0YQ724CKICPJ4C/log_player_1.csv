"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, seems fair""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $3,000 is worth 20% less than the $6,000 I could have gotten in the first round, so it's effectively $2,400. And Bob's gain of $7,000 is worth 5% less than the $4,000 he could have gotten in the first round, so it's effectively $3,100.

Considering the offer, I'm not thrilled about giving up more than I initially proposed, but I'm willing to compromise. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
