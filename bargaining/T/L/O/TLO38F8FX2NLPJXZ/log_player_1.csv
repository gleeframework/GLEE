Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair and reasonable proposal!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60 dollars and Bob gets 40 dollars. I think this is a fair and reasonable split, considering we're both starting with the same amount of money."
