"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the $1,000,000 and leave 40% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

After considering it, I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not convinced that I'm getting a fair deal, especially considering the value of the money is decreasing faster for me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share of the money and giving Bob a reasonable amount, considering the decreasing value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing rapidly!

After considering Bob's new offer, I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

The difference in value between our shares is getting larger, and I'm not comfortable with the idea of taking such a small amount, especially considering the decreasing value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my new offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise that takes into account the decreasing value of the money, but I'm still aiming to get a slightly larger share to make up for the lost value."
