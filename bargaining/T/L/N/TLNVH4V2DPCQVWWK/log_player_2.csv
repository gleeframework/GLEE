"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money 60/40.  It's a fair deal for the first round. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's split the money 55/45. It's a better deal than your previous offer.""}\n\n###\nSince it's the second round, I'll try to negotiate for a bit more. I'm willing to give Alice 45, which is 5 more than what she offered me in the first round. Let's see if she accepts!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the time pressure, but your offer is too low. Let's meet in the middle at 55/45. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n### 

Since Alice's offer is the same as my previous offer but with the values flipped, and considering the inflation, I think I can still negotiate for a better deal. I'll reject this offer and try to propose something more favorable in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I need a bit more. Let's try 58/42.""}\n\n###\nI'm taking into account the inflation and trying to get a better deal. Since the money is worth less with each passing round, I'm increasing my proposed share to 58. Let's see if Alice is willing to accept this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is a game of diminishing returns, Bob. I'm offering 56/44, let's close this deal and avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n### 

I'll reject this offer because, despite the decreasing value of the money due to inflation, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Alice's offer of 56/44 is closer to my previous proposal, but I'm willing to take a risk and try to get a slightly better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Inflation is hitting me harder. I need 60 to make it worthwhile.""}\n\n###\nConsidering the increasing impact of inflation, I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a bit more aggressive than my previous offers, but I'm trying to compensate for the loss of value over time. Let's see if Alice is willing to accept this deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  We're both losing out. I'm dropping my offer slightly, but this is my final concession. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n### 

Considering the significant impact of inflation on the value of the money, I think it's time to accept Alice's offer. Although I was hoping for a better deal, the decreasing value of the money means that holding out for more may not be worth the risk. Alice's offer of 48/52 is not ideal, but it's better than the alternative of getting nothing if we fail to reach an agreement within the 12 rounds. I'll accept this offer to secure some value, even if it's not the best possible outcome."
