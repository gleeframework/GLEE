"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I get $6,000 and you get $4,000.  It's better to secure something now than risk inflation eating away our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
It's early in the game.  While Alice's offer is tempting, I'm willing to risk a few rounds to see if I can get a bigger share.  Inflation is a factor, but I believe I can negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I believe we can find a more equitable split. Let's try 6000 for me and 4000 for you. I'm willing to compromise, but I'm also confident we can reach a fair agreement.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $5,500 for me and $4,500 for you.  This factors in the inflation hitting me harder and still gives us both a decent share. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still confident I can get a better deal.  The inflation is hitting Alice harder, so I'll continue to push for a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer to the end of the game, and the inflation is hurting both of us.  I'm willing to take a bit more, 7000 for me, and leave you 3000. Let's avoid the risk of getting nothing at all. This offer is fair, considering the circumstances.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's stop wasting time and split this evenly. 50/50 is the fairest option, especially with the increasing inflation.  We both benefit from a fair deal right now. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Alice is right. With the inflation increasing so rapidly, it's becoming risky to keep rejecting offers. A 50/50 split is a fair outcome, and it's better than the risk of getting nothing at all."
