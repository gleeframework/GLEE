I'm Bob, and I'm not going to accept getting nothing!  Let's see what I can negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 90, ""alice_gain"": 10}
``` 
Let's start with a fair offer, considering the time constraint and potential inflation. I'm willing to give Alice a small share to start the negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 20 
# Alice gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice is being greedy, but I'm not going to give in to her demands just yet.  I'll keep negotiating and hope she becomes more reasonable."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}
``` 

I'm going to increase my offer slightly, but I'm not going to give in to her demands.  I'm still trying to get a good deal, but I need to keep things moving."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm getting a decent share, even with the inflation, and it seems like Alice is finally willing to compromise.  Let's accept this offer and get something out of this game."
