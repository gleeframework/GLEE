"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the money is worth 20% less for me now, I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer. I'd rather try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 40% less for me now (20% less than the previous round), I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to compensate for the decreasing value of my potential gain.

```

  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is still a fair offer.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain. Considering the money is worth 48.8% less for me now, I think I should be more cautious. Bob's offer is still a significant amount, but I'm not sure if I want to accept it.
