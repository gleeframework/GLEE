Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give up more than 5% of the total. Let's see if you'll accept! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm still thinking a 60/40 split is fair, but I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle at 55/45.  This is my final offer.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise further. This is my final offer: 52/48. I think it's a fair deal, and I'm not willing to go any lower. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
It's getting risky to keep rejecting offers, especially with the inflation hitting my gains hard.  While I'd prefer more, 4800 is better than nothing and a significant gain compared to the 4500 I would have gotten in the last round.  I'll accept this offer."
