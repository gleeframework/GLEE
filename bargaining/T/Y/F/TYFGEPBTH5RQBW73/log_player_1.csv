Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose to keep 900,000$ and give Bob 100,000$. I believe this is a fair offer, as I'm taking a larger share due to the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
