Round 2

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's compromise.  I'll take 48, and you can have 52.  I think that's fair considering the inflation, and it's a better deal for both of us than rejecting each other again. 
# Bob gain: 52 
# Alice gain: 48
