Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 80,

Round 3

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, let's go with a 60/40 split. This keeps our division fair while accounting for the diminishing value of money. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60
