"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $580,000 is worth 90% of the original $600,000, which is $540,000. Bob's gain of $420,000 is worth 95% of the original $440,000, which is $399,000.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
