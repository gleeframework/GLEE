Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Time is running out, but I still think I can get a better deal. Inflation hurts, but I'll take the risk. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of inflation, but her offer still significantly favors her. While time is running out, accepting a bad deal is worse than no deal at all.  I'll continue to apply pressure in the next round."
