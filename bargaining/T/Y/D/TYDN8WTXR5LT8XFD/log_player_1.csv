"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and call it a day!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. What do you think, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still not willing to give up too much. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping to do better in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not giving up more than I need to.""
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive in this round, while still being reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much more. You're getting closer, though! 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the significant hit from inflation, I'm getting a bit desperate. However, I still think I can do better.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 4.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3800,
  ""bob_gain"": 6200,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting closer, but I still think I deserve a bit more. Let's meet in the middle, but closer to my end.""
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive in this round, but still being reasonable considering the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth, but I'm willing to give a bit more. This is my final offer, though! 
# Alice gain: 3200 
# Bob gain: 6800 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings! With the money I gain being worth only 61.05% of what it was in the first round, I'm getting desperate.

However, I don't want to give up without a fight. I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 6.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round, but I'm not getting my hopes up!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3600,
  ""bob_gain"": 6400,
  ""message"": ""I'm running out of options, but I'm not giving up. This is my best offer so far.""
}
```

I'm trying to be realistic about the value of the money at this point, but I still want to try to get a slightly better deal."
