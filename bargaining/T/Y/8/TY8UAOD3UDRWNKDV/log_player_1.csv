"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll meet you in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of 20 is worth 5% less than the 60 I would have gotten in the first round.

I'm not thrilled about the 20, but I think it's a decent compromise. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer and we can move on to the next round!"
