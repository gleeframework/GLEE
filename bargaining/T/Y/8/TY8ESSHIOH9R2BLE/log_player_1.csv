"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
```

This offer gives Alice 90% of the money and Bob 10%. I'm hoping to get a good starting point with a generous offer, and I'll see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is trying to turn the tables on me, but I won't accept that. I still have a lot of time and I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8100, ""bob_gain"": 1900} 
```

I'm going to stick with a similar approach to Round 1, but I'll adjust the offer slightly to reflect the inflation. I'm still aiming for a large portion of the money, and I'm hoping Bob will realize that rejecting again will only hurt him more in the long run."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse, but I'm still not desperate enough to accept it. I have a strong sense that he's going to start feeling the pressure of inflation soon. I'll keep playing the long game."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7290, ""bob_gain"": 2710} 
```

I'm sticking to a similar strategy as before, but I'm decreasing my share more slowly this time to see if Bob starts getting more reasonable. The inflation is definitely biting him harder now, and I hope he realizes that he needs to compromise."
