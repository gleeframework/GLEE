"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

I'm going to start with a pretty generous offer to Bob. I figure if I can get him to accept it early, I can minimize the impact of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

I'm going to reject this offer.  Even with inflation, I can still do better by making my own counter-proposal. I know Bob is feeling the sting of inflation more than I am, and I'm going to try to exploit that."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000} 
```

I'm going to offer Bob 3000, hoping he'll accept it given the inflation.  I'm still aiming for a significant share, but I need to be more realistic now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob is getting bolder with his offers, but I'm still not willing to settle for such a small share. I'm going to try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to stick with a slightly higher share than Bob offered, but I'm also acknowledging the increasing pressure of inflation. I need to be more flexible without giving away too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse, but I'm still holding out for a better deal. The inflation is really starting to bite now, but I'm hoping to get a more equitable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm going to propose a 50/50 split.  The inflation is getting out of control, and I need to secure a reasonable share before it's too late.  I think this is a fair compromise, especially given the circumstances."
