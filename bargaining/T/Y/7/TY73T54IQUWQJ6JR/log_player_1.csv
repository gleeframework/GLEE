"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start by being generous.  I'll offer Bob a small share, hoping to end the game quickly.  Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. While it's tempting to take a small share now, I know that the money will be worth less in subsequent rounds, and I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal later on."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'll increase my offer slightly, but still aim for a larger share. I believe Bob will see the value in reaching an agreement soon, as the money will keep depreciating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I reject this offer. While I am starting to feel the pressure of inflation, I'm still confident I can secure a more equitable split.  I'll continue to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm increasing my offer again.  I'm starting to feel the inflation, but I'm still aiming for a significant share.  I believe Bob will start to see the value in reaching a deal before the money is worth even less."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While this offer is a bit better than the previous one, I'm still not happy with it. I'm starting to feel the effects of inflation, but I believe I can still get a better deal if I hold out."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm starting to feel the pinch of inflation, so I'm reducing my offer slightly.  However, I'm still aiming for a more equitable split, and I believe Bob will recognize the value in reaching an agreement soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still not happy with this offer.  The inflation is starting to seriously affect the value of the money, but I believe I can still negotiate a better deal.  I'll keep trying."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

The inflation is really starting to bite now.  I'm going to propose an even split.  It's better than getting nothing, and it might be enough to get Bob to accept before the money becomes completely worthless."
