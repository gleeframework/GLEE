"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

This means I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll consider the actual values in Round 2.

The offer is:
Alice gain: 200,000 (which is 80% of 250,000, considering the 20% reduction due to inflation)
Bob gain: 800,000 (which is 80% of 1,000,000)

I'll decide to reject this offer, as I'd like to aim for a higher share. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 40% less due to inflation (20% in the first round and another 20% in the second round), I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 320000,
  ""bob_gain"": 680000
}
```

This means I'm offering Bob $680,000 and keeping $320,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values in Round 4, considering the 48.8% reduction due to inflation.

The offer is:
Alice gain: 400,000 (which is 51.2% of 780,000, considering the 48.8% reduction)
Bob gain: 600,000 (which is 51.2% of 1,168,000)

I'll decide to accept this offer, as it seems reasonable considering the reduced value of the money.
