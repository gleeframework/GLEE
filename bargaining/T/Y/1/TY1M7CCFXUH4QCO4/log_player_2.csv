Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering you a small share, but it's better than nothing. Let's get this over with quickly.

# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting this offer. I think I can get a better deal in the next round. Besides, with inflation, the money is worth less to Alice than it is to me, so I'm willing to take a risk and see what I can get in the next round. Bring it on!"
