"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since I have to consider the decreasing value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to be strategic. My current gain of 5000 is worth less than my initial gain of 6000 in the first round, but I'm not sure if I should accept Bob's offer or wait for a better one.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly due to inflation. I need to think carefully about Bob's new offer. His offer is a 50/50 split, which is a significant change from his previous offer. Considering the decreasing value of the money, I'm not sure if I should accept this offer.

However, I'm running out of time, and I don't want to risk waiting for a better offer that might not come. I'll accept Bob's offer.
