Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your initial offer was a good starting point, Alice. However, I believe a 55/45 split in my favor is more reflective of the inflation disparity we face. Do you agree? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55
