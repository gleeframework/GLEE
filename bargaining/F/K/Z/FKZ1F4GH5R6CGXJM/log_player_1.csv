"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 40%. I'm hoping this is a reasonable starting point for negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I can do better than that. Your turn to decide! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 20% less, so I'll have to be careful with my decision.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to reject it. I'd rather wait for a better offer, especially since the money is worth less with each passing round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 40% less due to inflation, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think this is a fairer split.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 45% of the remaining $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 55%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I still think I deserve more. Let's see if you can do better. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is catching up with me! With my gain worth 48.8% less, I'll have to be even more careful.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to reject it again. I'm not willing to take 40% of the remaining money, especially since it's worth even less than it was before.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

}
```
