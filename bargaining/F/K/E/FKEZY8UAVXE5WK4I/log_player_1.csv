Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, my offer from Round 1 was 6000 for me and 4000 for Bob. To adjust for the 20% and 10% devaluation, I'll increase my share and decrease Bob's share accordingly. Here's my new offer:

  ""alice_gain"": 7200,
  ""bob_gain"": 2800

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The offers are getting more interesting. Given the significant inflation, I'll think carefully... My gain is worth 48.8% less, but Bob's gain is worth 27.1% less. Considering this, I think Bob's offer is a good opportunity to get a larger share of the remaining value. I'll accept this offer.
