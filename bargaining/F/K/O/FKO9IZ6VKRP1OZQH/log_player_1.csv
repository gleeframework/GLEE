I'm going for a very lopsided offer, but I'm banking on Bob's greed to get him to accept it in the first round.  There's a lot of money on the table and it's not worth risking getting nothing at all.  Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob is being greedy!  He's offering me a tiny fraction of the money, and I'm not going to give in.  I'll make my own proposal next round, and hopefully, he'll see reason."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a more equitable split this time. Bob's offer was ridiculous, and I think a 50/50 split is fair.  I'm hoping he'll accept this and we can both walk away with a decent amount of money."
