"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to do better in the next round.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000, which is a relatively small amount, to try to leave room for him to negotiate and make a better offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous, I'll take this deal! 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take advantage of my generosity!

I'll reject this offer. I'd rather wait for a better deal. My current gain is already worth 20% less due to inflation, and I don't want to settle for a smaller share.

```

  ""message"": ""I'm not as generous as before. You'll have to do better to get a bigger share.""

# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take advantage of my more aggressive offer!

I'll reject this offer as well. The inflation is already eating into my potential gains, and I'd rather not settle for a smaller share. I'll try to negotiate further.

```

I'm trying to be more conciliatory and meet Bob halfway, but I'm also making it clear that I'm not willing to give up without a fight. I'm hoping to see if Bob will take this offer and end the game, or if he'll try to push for an even better deal."
