"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

I'm starting with a very high offer for myself, hoping Bob will be tempted to accept early.  I'm aware of the inflation, but I want to secure as much as possible in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting this offer. While it's a significant amount, I believe I can do better. I'm willing to take the risk of another round to see if I can secure a larger portion."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm raising my offer from the previous round, but keeping it at a level that I think is fair.  Bob has shown he's willing to be aggressive, but I'm still confident I can secure a larger portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting this offer.  While it's better than the previous round, I believe I can still get a larger share.  I'm willing to take the risk of another round to see if I can negotiate a more favorable deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm increasing my offer again, aiming for a 70/30 split. The inflation is starting to bite, but I'm hoping Bob will see the value in securing a deal before it gets worse."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

The inflation is really starting to hurt now.  While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this 50/50 split is the most sensible option.  Any more rounds and I'll lose even more money.  It's time to cut my losses and secure at least something."
