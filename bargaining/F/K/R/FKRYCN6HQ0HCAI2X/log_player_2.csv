Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer is still a bit skewed towards her side. Considering the inflation effect, I'll try to adjust my calculation.

Since my gain is worth 19% less, I'll aim for a higher percentage of the original 100$. I'll propose a more balanced offer.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 19% less now, and my previous offer was rejected, I'll try to adjust my offer to account for the inflation and the fact that I'm making the next proposal.

I'll aim for a slightly higher share to account for the reduced value of the money.
