Round 3

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  Each round diminishes the value of the money, especially for me.  I need to apply pressure to get a deal done quickly.
* **Understanding Bob:** Bob's last offer was heavily skewed in his favor. He's likely trying to intimidate me. I need to stand firm and show I'm also willing to walk away.
* **Finality:** By stating this is my final offer, I'm increasing the seriousness of the negotiation. It pushes Bob to make a decision now."
