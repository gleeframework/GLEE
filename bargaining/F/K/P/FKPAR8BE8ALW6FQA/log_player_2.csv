"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob.  This gives you a sizable sum, and we can both enjoy our winnings sooner. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. While 300,000 is a decent sum, I know that with each round, the value of the money decreases for me. I'm hoping to get a larger share if I can hold out a few more rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'm confident I can get a better deal for myself in the future rounds, but I'm willing to compromise.  This offer is fair, and we can both get a decent share of the money.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear you're playing hardball.  This is my final offer - take it or leave it. Every round that passes hurts you more than it hurts me. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, Alice is right, each passing round hurts me more.  I'll accept this offer before the inflation eats away at my potential gains any further."
