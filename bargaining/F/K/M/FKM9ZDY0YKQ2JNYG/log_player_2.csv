Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offers are getting worse for her due to inflation, but they are still not addressing the disparity in how inflation is impacting us.  I need to push for a more favorable outcome before time runs out."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""This is getting ridiculous.  I'm offering a completely even split. Take it or leave it.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's time to play hardball. Alice needs to understand the urgency of the situation. Offering a 50/50 split highlights the unfairness of the inflation disparity while still being a reasonable proposal.  If she rejects this, she's likely overestimating her negotiating position."
