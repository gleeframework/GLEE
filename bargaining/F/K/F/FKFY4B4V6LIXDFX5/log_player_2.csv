"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I'll take most of the money this round, but you'll get a chance to even the score later. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nSince the money is worth 5% less for me with each passing round, I want to try to get a better deal than just $1000. I'm hoping that in future rounds, Alice will offer me a larger share of the money. Plus, her message implies that I'll have a chance to ""even the score later"", which suggests that she might be willing to make a more generous offer in the future. So, I'll reject this offer and see what happens next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Let's compromise, I'll take less than half, considering the inflation.""}\n\n###\n\nI've decided to offer a compromise, taking 40% of the money, which is less than half. This way, I'm showing that I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial solution. Considering the inflation, I'm hoping that Alice will see the value in accepting this offer, as the money will be worth less to me in future rounds."
