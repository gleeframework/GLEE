"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a very unequal offer to see if Bob is willing to accept anything. I'm hoping this encourages him to make a fairer offer in the future."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
 
I'm going to reject this offer.  While it's tempting to take $1, I think I can do better than that in the remaining rounds. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50} 
```

I'm going to propose a 50/50 split. This is a fair offer, and I think it's more likely to be accepted than my previous proposal."
