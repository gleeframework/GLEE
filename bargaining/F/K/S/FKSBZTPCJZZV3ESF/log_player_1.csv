"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, with each of us getting $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","My proposal from round 1 was rejected, and now Bob is making a new offer.

I'll consider his proposal. Since the money is worth 5% less due to inflation, the effective gains are $4,000 for me and $6,000 for Bob.

I'll reject this offer as well. It's not in my favor.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a new proposal. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

I'm offering a slightly weighted split, with me getting $5,500 and Bob getting $4,500."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value quickly due to inflation.

I'll consider Bob's new offer. Since the money is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, the effective gains are $4,800 for me and $5,200 for Bob.

I'll accept this offer. It's a slightly better deal for me than my previous offers, and it's a reasonable split considering the situation.
