Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm aiming for a fair deal. I'll take a slight hit from my initial offer, but this split makes sense. Let's close this out before inflation eats away at our potential gains.

# Alice gain: 58

Round 4
