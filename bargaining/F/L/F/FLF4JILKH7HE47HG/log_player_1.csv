Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: How about a 55/45 split?  It's still early, let's be reasonable and avoid letting the money shrink.

""alice_gain"": 58,

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this back and forth isn't helping anyone.  A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both get a decent share before inflation eats away at it further. Let's be logical. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
It's tempting to hold out for a slightly better deal, but Bob is right. The longer this goes on, the more we both lose to inflation. A 50/50 split is fair and ensures we both walk away with something reasonable."
