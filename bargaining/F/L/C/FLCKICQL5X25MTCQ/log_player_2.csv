**Reasoning:**

Even though the value is decreasing, it's important to hold my ground for a slightly better deal. Alice's offers are becoming more reasonable, but I think with the inflation working heavily against her, I can secure a slightly larger share in the coming rounds."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Okay, Alice.  Let's split this evenly and call it a day.  The clock is ticking.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I still believe I could get a slightly better deal, the diminishing returns due to inflation are becoming a significant factor. Offering a 50/50 split at this point guarantees a reasonable payout for both of us.  It's time to settle before the value deteriorates further."
