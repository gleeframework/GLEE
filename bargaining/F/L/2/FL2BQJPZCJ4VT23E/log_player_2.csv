Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 47 
# Alice gain: 53 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is using the inflation argument to her advantage, but she's still getting a significantly larger share. While the value of her share is decreasing, it's a risk I'm willing to take to negotiate a fairer split. We're past the halfway point, and I need to hold my ground."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 49,
""alice_gain"": 51,
""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time. I'm sticking to my previous offer - it's a fair compromise considering the inflation. Let's settle this now before we both lose out.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** It's time to stand firm. Alice is unlikely to accept anything less than 51 at this point, so repeating the previous offer is the best strategy. The message emphasizes the urgency and reinforces the fairness of the proposal."
