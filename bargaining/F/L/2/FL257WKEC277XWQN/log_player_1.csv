"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit one-sided, Alice. Let's be more realistic. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. It's a decent deal considering your share decreases in value each round. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
