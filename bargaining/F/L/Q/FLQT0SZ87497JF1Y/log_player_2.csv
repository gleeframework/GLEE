"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we divide the money 3:2 in my favor. This is fair considering the risk of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's proposal might seem ""fair"" based on the risk of inflation, it's important to remember that Bob doesn't know how inflation affects Alice.  Rejecting allows Bob to make a proposal in the next round, potentially securing a more favorable share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Let's split the money 60/40 in my favor.  It's a fairer split considering the risk of inflation, and it gives us both a good starting point.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I propose we divide the money 55:45 in my favor. This maintains a balance while acknowledging the risk for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still not favorable to Bob.  While the inflation is acknowledged, the split is still skewed significantly in her favor.  Bob has shown that he is willing to negotiate and might be able to secure a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Let's try a 55/45 split in my favor.  This takes inflation into account while still being a reasonable compromise for both of us.""
