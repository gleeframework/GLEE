"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a small portion to test the waters.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split, with me getting $8,000 and Bob getting $2,000. My message is a friendly one, trying to establish a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not accepting your lowball offer, I think I deserve more. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to negotiate a bit harder.

Since the money is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll adjust my proposal accordingly. I'll accept Bob's offer for now, as it's a slightly better split than my initial proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
