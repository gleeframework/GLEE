"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself, with the message suggesting a 60-40 split as a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'm starting low 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer for Round 2. Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think it's too low for me, considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation. I'll try to negotiate further!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 40% less for me now, I'll have to be more aggressive in my offer. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's compromise""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 550,000$ and keeping 450,000$ for myself, with the message suggesting a compromise and meeting in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Getting closer, but still too little for me 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is getting scarcer and scarcer! With the value of my potential gain decreasing rapidly, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll have to be more cautious.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because, although it's getting closer to my desired amount, I still think it's too low for me, given the continued erosion of the money's value due to inflation. I'll try to negotiate further!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly! With the money worth 61.6% less than in the first round, I'll have to make a bold move. Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Equal split, no more games""
}
```

I'm offering Bob an equal split of 500,000$, with the message suggesting that it's time to stop playing games and settle on a fair and equal division."
