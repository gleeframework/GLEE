Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000, ""message"": ""I think a 90/10 split is fairer, with me getting the bigger share this time.  Let's see if you agree.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise.  Let's do 81/19 this time.  I think it's a reasonable split considering the inflation we've already seen.  Let's end this game! 
# Bob gain: 190000 
# Alice gain: 810000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though the money is worth less, accepting this offer means I get a larger share than I would if we kept playing and risk losing even more money."
