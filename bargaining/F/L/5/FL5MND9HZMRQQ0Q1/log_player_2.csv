Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: Considering inflation, I deserve a bit more 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is taking its toll, I need a better deal 
# Bob gain: 49 
# Alice gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting desperate due to inflation and is now offering a worse deal than before (Round 3). We're past the halfway point, and she'll likely become more agreeable soon to avoid getting $0."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""We're running out of time, let's settle this. This offer considers the time pressure.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Time is running out, let's meet in the middle 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is finally acknowledging the time pressure.  While an even split isn't ideal considering the inflation working in my favor, accepting guarantees I get something. If I reject and we fail to agree, we both lose everything."
