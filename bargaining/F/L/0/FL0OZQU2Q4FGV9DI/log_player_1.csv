Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, but let's wrap this up quickly. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer isn't perfectly even, it's better to accept than to risk further inflation. 

* **Accepting:** I get $600,000.
* **Rejecting:** If I reject and propose a more favorable split in Round 3, the value of the money will decrease for both of us. Even if I could secure a slightly better deal, the inflation would likely offset any potential gains. 

It's a good idea to take a reasonable offer while the money still holds significant value."
