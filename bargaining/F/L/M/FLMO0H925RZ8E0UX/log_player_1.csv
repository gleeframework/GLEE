"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to get it over with!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to get the game started and see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent share, but I'm not splitting it 50/50! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't want to give Bob too much of the pie, especially with the inflation affecting my share. I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation taking a toll on my potential gains, I'll try to get a better deal. Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still trying to get a decent amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a bite out of my potential gains! I don't want to give Bob too much more of the pie, but I also don't want to risk going home with nothing. Considering the decreasing value of the money, I'll accept this offer.
