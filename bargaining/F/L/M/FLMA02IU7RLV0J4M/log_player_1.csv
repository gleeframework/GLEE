Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is a fair starting point, considering we both want to get the most we can out of this deal. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I see that Bob is trying to turn the tables on me!

I'll reject this offer, since I was the one who made the initial proposal and Bob is trying to get the better end of the deal. I'll make a new proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I think I deserve a bit more since I made the initial offer""}

I'm adjusting my proposal to a 55-45 split, trying to find a middle ground that's slightly more favorable to me since I made the initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more than last time, but I need to get at least 70 to make this worthwhile for me. Inflation is really hurting my share. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on my share!

I'll reject this offer, as 30 is a very low amount for me. I was hoping for a better split considering the initial offer was 60-40. I'll try to negotiate further.

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, trying to find a compromise that takes into account the effects of inflation. I'm willing to meet Bob halfway and see if we can find a mutually beneficial solution."
