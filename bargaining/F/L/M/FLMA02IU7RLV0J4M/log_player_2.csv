Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm still going to reject this offer.  Even though I'm losing value due to inflation, I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round. Alice is still offering a significant advantage to herself."

I'll accept this offer. The inflation is really hitting hard now, and getting a 50/50 split is a good outcome given the circumstances."
