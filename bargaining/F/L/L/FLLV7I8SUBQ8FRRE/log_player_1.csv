"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}

This is a fairly standard 60-40 split, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it quickly so we can move on to the next round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","A 50-50 split! That's a fair offer, but I'm hoping to get a better deal. I'll reject it for now.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob was willing to split it 50-50 last round, I'll try to get a slightly better deal this time. Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}"
