I'm starting with a generous offer to Bob, hoping to get the game over quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is better than his initial proposal, I believe I can still get a better deal.  I'm willing to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with a split that gives me a larger share while still being fair. I believe this offer will be more appealing to Bob given the inflation he's experiencing."
