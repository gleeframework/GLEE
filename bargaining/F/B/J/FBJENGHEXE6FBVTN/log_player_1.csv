"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more balanced split is better. Let's go with 51 for me and 49 for you.  It's still a fair deal, but more equitable. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","{
