"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 90-10, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share to see if he'll accept and we can end the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more careful with the inflation in mind. Since the money is worth less, I'll want to aim for a larger share. However, Bob's offer is still quite skewed towards him.

```

# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation taking a bigger hit, I'll have to be more cautious. Meeting in the middle sounds like a reasonable compromise, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the inflation is really taking a toll, I'll aim for an even larger share to compensate for the decreasing value of money. Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{

  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a bigger risk, but I need a bigger reward!""

# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more, but I'm willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really eating away at the value of the money! With my share worth almost 41% less than in the first round, I'll have to be even more aggressive to get a fair deal. Bob's offer is still a bit skewed towards him, but it's getting closer to a 50-50 split.

Round 7

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I need some stability in this inflationary environment! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really crippling the value of the money! With my share worth over 50% less than in the first round, I'll have to be extremely cautious. Bob's offer is still a bit skewed towards him, but it's getting closer to a 50-50 split.

However, I'm not sure if I can afford to be too greedy at this point. Considering the extreme inflation, I'll take a more conservative approach.
