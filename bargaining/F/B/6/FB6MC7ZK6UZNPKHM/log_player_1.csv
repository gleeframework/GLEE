"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going for a high stake in the first round.  I'll keep 90% of the money and give Bob 10%. This should encourage him to accept the offer, as the money will only depreciate in value with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get more, a 50/50 split is a fair outcome given the inflation and the fact that Bob is willing to share equally.  Accepting ensures I get something, and with the decreasing value of the money, it's not likely I can do much better in the following rounds."
