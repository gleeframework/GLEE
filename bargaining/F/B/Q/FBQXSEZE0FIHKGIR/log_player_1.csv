"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take 60% and you can take 40%""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more, but still a fair split 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth less due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not comfortable with a 75-25 split, especially since the money is already worth less due to inflation. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""I'll compromise and take a bit less, but I think this is a fair split considering the inflation""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent amount and being reasonable, given the effects of inflation. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take most of it, but I'm willing to give you a small share 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are taking a toll on the money's value!

Considering the significant decrease in the value of the money, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. However, I'm not thrilled with the 80-20 split, especially since the money is worth less than before.

I'll reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for a better offer from Bob, hoping he'll be more generous considering the inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 320000,
  ""bob_gain"": 680000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and take a bit less, but I think this is a fair split considering the inflation and the previous offers""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground that works for both of us, taking into account the decreasing value of the money due to inflation. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
