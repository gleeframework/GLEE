"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see what Alice proposes in the next round!  I'm not sure I want to accept a 20% cut of the money, especially when it's only round 1."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, Alice. It's a fair deal and avoids any further negotiation. ""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob. I'll take a smaller share, but I still think I deserve a bit more. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd still prefer a 50/50 split, with the inflation kicking in and Alice's willingness to compromise, accepting this offer seems like the best course of action."
