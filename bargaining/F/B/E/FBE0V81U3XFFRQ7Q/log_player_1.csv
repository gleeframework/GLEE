"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial 100$, leaving Bob with 20%. My message to Bob is a friendly one, suggesting that we start with a fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so I'll calculate my gain accordingly.

My gain would be 90% of 80, which is 72.

Bob's offer is to meet in the middle, which would give me 50 and him 50. Since I'm getting less value from the same amount due to inflation, I'm actually getting a better deal than I was in the first round.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
