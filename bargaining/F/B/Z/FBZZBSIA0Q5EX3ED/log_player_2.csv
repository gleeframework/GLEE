"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split the money. This offer is a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. I know Alice is trying to be ""fair"", but the offer significantly benefits her, and with inflation, the value of my share will keep declining with each round. I'll try to get a better deal for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is fair, considering the inflation rate. It's a good deal for both of us, and we can get this done before the value of the money drops too much.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the inflation is a factor, but your previous offer wasn't fair to me. This is my compromise - let's close the deal and avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice is still trying to get a bigger share, even with the inflation affecting her gains more. While this offer is better than her initial one, I'm still aiming for a larger share. I'm confident I can get a better deal in the coming rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""Alice, we're both losing money with each round. Let's be realistic. I'm offering a 70/30 split, which is still a fair compromise considering the inflation. Accept this and we can both walk away with a decent amount.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. The inflation is hurting both of us now. I'm offering a 50/50 split to end this. Let's be reasonable and take it. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I'd still prefer a bigger share, the inflation is becoming a serious factor.  With each round, the value of the money is shrinking significantly for both of us.  Accepting a 50/50 split at this point is the most logical choice to avoid losing more money."
