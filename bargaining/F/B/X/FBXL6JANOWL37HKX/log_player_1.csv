Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to be greedy in the first round and try to secure the majority of the money. I'll offer Bob $100,000. I'm hoping he'll accept, but if not, I'll adjust my strategy for the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It's better to take the 500,000 now than risk getting nothing in the next round. Even with the 20% inflation, 500,000 is a good amount, and there's no guarantee I'll get anything better if I reject."
