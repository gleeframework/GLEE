"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can split the million before it's too late!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $700,000 and Bob gets $300,000. I'm trying to appeal to Bob's sense of urgency by hinting that the value of the money will decrease with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous, now it's my turn to be kind 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of my initial generosity.

I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting Bob's offer, and I'll wait for him to make another proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Due to inflation, the money is now worth 20% less than in the first round. Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle and we can both walk away with a decent sum!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise that's more favorable to me, while still being reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving up too much 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a better deal.

I'll reject his offer again and try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting Bob's offer, and I'll wait for him to make another proposal. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer next time to counter his attempt to take advantage of the inflation."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Due to inflation, the money is now worth 36.9% less than in the first round. Here's my new offer:

  ""bob_gain"": 500000,

}
```
