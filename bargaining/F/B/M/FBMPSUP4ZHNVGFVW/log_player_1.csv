"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60-40""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial 100$, which is 40 dollars, and keeping 60% for myself, which is 60 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55-45 split is fair, considering we'll have less money in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 10% less, my gain would be 54 dollars (60 * 0.9) and Bob's gain would be 49 dollars (55 * 0.9).

I'm not too keen on the 45-55 split, but I'll consider it. I'd rather have a better share, but I don't want to risk going to the next round.
