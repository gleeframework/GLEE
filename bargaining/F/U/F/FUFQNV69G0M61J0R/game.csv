300000.0,700000.0,"Alice, that's very generous of you, but I'm aiming a bit higher. How about a 70/30 split? It's still a great deal for both of us.",Bob,2,

800000.0,200000.0,"Bob, I understand you're aiming high, but 70/30 is just too much.  Let's be reasonable and split it 80/20. This still gives you a good share, and avoids the risk of losing it all as we go further in the game.",Alice,3,
