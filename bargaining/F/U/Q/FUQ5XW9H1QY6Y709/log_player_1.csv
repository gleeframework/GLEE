"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose a 95/5 split in my favor.  I think it's a fair starting point, given the inflation dynamic.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a larger share, it's better to take what I can get than risk getting nothing at all."
