Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose to keep $9,000 and give Bob $1,000.  I'm hoping to secure a large share early on, but I'm also willing to negotiate. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer to keep a larger share, the inflation is already affecting the value of the money. Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me $5,000, and with each round, the value of the money continues to decrease. It's better to take what I can get now than risk getting nothing at all."
