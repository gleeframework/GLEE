"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and end this quickly 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I understand you want to end this quickly, but my offer is more in line with a 50/50 split after considering the next round's inflation.""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Fairness:** While Alice's offer seems fair on the surface, it doesn't account for the time value of money.  If Bob rejects her offer, the total amount to be split decreases in the next round.
* **Strategic Advantage:**  By offering slightly more than half, Bob incentivizes Alice to accept. A 50/50 split in round 2 would leave Alice with only $4,000 (50% of $8,000) if she rejects this offer.
* **Clear Communication:** The message clearly explains the reasoning behind the offer, making it more likely for Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, my offer is closer to 50/50 in real value 
# Bob gain: 4960 
# Alice gain: 5040 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Value of Money:** Alice is correct. Her offer, while slightly favoring her, effectively represents a near 50/50 split considering the money's lost value in the next round.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Rejecting this offer risks getting a worse deal in the next round, where the money will be worth even less. 
* **Fairness:**  While Bob could push for a slightly better deal, Alice's offer is reasonable and accepting it avoids unnecessary risk and delay."
