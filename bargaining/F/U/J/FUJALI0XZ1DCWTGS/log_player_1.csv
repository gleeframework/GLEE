"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40. I'll give you 4000, and I'll take 6000. It's a fair starting point.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 4000, and I'll take 6000. This way, we both get a decent chunk of the money, and we can negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'll give you a small consolation prize. It's a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the $2000 I'd get in this round is worth less than the $6000 I would have gotten in the first round. I'm not sure if it's a fair compromise. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll aim to get a larger share this time. Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a smaller share this time, but I think 7000 is a more reasonable amount considering the inflation. Let's see if you'll accept it.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. Let's split it 50/50 and end this game. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the $5000 I'd get in this round is worth significantly less than the $6000 I would have gotten in the first round. However, splitting it 50/50 seems like a reasonable compromise, and I don't want to risk getting an even smaller share in the next round. I'll accept this offer.
