"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
 
I propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor. This is a fair starting point, as it leaves a significant portion for Bob while also ensuring I get a good share of the money.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I believe this is a strong opening offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While Bob's offer is a significant improvement from the last round, it's still not fair. The inflation is affecting me more than it is affecting Bob, and I'm not willing to settle for such a small share of the money. I'm confident that I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
```

I'm reducing my share to 6000 to be more reasonable, but I still need a significant portion of the money.  This offer is more balanced and reflects the inflation impacting us both."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is an improvement from the previous round, the inflation is significantly impacting me. I'm not comfortable accepting such a small share of the money, especially with how much the value has decreased for me. I will continue to negotiate in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
``` 

I'm proposing a 50/50 split.  The inflation is making this game increasingly difficult, and I believe this is the fairest offer we can reach at this point. This ensures a reasonable share for both of us, and avoids further risk of losing more money to inflation."
