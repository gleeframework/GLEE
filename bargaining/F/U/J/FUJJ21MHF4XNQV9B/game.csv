75.0,25.0,I propose we split the money with a ratio of 3:1 in favor of Bob. This ensures a fair distribution considering the decreasing value of money over time.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
50.0,50.0,"A 50/50 split is a fair and simple way to divide the money, considering the value of the money will decrease with each passing round.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
61.25,38.75,"Considering the inflation, I propose a division where I receive $61.25 and Bob receives $38.75. This maintains a fair distribution while accounting for the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
60.0,40.0,"Considering the inflation, I'm willing to accept a slightly uneven split to ensure we can still divide the money fairly. I propose a 40/60 split, giving Alice a slightly larger share to account for the decreasing value of money.",Bob,4,
