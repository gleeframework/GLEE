"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 650000,
""bob_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Let's make a deal, Bob. I take $650,000, you take $350,000. It's better than waiting and getting less with each round due to inflation.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Value of Money:**  The longer the negotiation goes, the less the money is worth for both of us, but especially for Bob who faces a higher inflation rate.
* **First Mover Advantage:**  By making a strong offer upfront, I'm setting the tone for the negotiation. It's likely Bob will be more willing to settle to avoid further losses from inflation.
* **Not Too Greedy:** Offering Bob $350,000 is still a significant sum. Aiming for an overly aggressive split might make Bob more likely to reject the offer and prolong the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair deal, Alice. We both get a decent amount, and we don't have to worry about losing money to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is heavily skewed in his favor. While he claims it's fair, the impact of inflation is not equal for both of us. 

Here's why:

* **My Loss:** Accepting his offer means I lose $200,000 compared to my initial offer in Round 1 (even considering the 5% inflation). 
* **His Gain:** Bob, on the other hand, gains $200,000 compared to my initial offer, even with the 10% inflation he faces.

I believe I have a stronger negotiating position than what Bob is offering. By rejecting, I signal that I'm willing to wait for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. This is my final offer - it's a good deal considering the inflation we're both facing.  Take it now, or risk losing even more.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've reduced my demand slightly from $650,000 to $600,000. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise, but not by much.
* **Deadline Pressure:** By calling it my ""final offer,"" I'm introducing a sense of urgency. Bob knows that if he rejects this, I might be even tougher in the next round (assuming there is one).
* **Highlighting Shared Loss:**  I'm emphasizing the negative impact of inflation for both of us. This reinforces the idea that delaying a decision is detrimental to both parties.

By framing this offer strategically, I'm increasing the pressure on Bob to accept a deal that, while not ideal for him, is still better than further losses due to inflation."
