"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, which is a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. With the money worth 20% less, I'm effectively getting only $160,000 (200,000 x 0.8), which is a relatively small share. However, it's still more than I would get if I wait for the next round, where the money would be worth even less.

I'll decide to accept this offer.
