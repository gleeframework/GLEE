Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer was a tad unfair. Let's be reasonable: I'll take the 55% since I'm the one making the offer this round. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
