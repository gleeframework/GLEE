I'm proposing a 90/10 split, with me getting the larger share. I'm hoping this is a fair starting point, and that Bob will accept. Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best strategy. My share is significantly lower than the first round, but with the risk of getting nothing at all, it's better to take the 5000 now.  It's unclear how the inflation affects Bob's perspective, but it seems like he's willing to compromise, and it's likely he will continue to offer progressively less in the future."
