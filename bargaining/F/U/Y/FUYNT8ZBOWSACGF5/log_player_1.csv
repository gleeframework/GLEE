"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

As Alice, I want to maximize my share.  Since the money is worth 10% less each round, I want to secure a large share as early as possible. I'm offering Bob a small share to hopefully incentivize him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though Bob's offer is better than my previous one, I am still in a position of power. The money I gain is worth 10% less, but Bob's money is worth 20% less. This means that his offer is less attractive to him than it would have been in the previous round. I believe I can still push for a better deal in the next round, where I will be the one making the proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my share from the previous round, but still offering Bob a significant amount. The inflation has impacted Bob's offer more significantly than mine, so I'm aiming for a more balanced division, while still securing a larger portion for myself.  I'm confident that Bob will be more inclined to accept this offer than my previous one, as the value of his potential gain has decreased further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is not ideal, but the inflation has significantly impacted both of our potential gains. My offer has lost 27.1% of its value, while Bob's has lost 48.8%. This means that while his offer is less than I would like, it is still a relatively good deal for me in the current economic climate. Further rounds would likely result in even smaller gains for both of us. It's time to accept the offer and end the game."
