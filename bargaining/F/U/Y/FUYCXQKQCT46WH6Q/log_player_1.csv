Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a high offer for myself, as the money will lose value quickly. I'm hoping Bob will accept this in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting this offer. While the money is worth less, Bob is still offering a decent amount. It's better than risking losing everything in the later rounds."
