"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""A fair and generous start""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $800,000, and Bob gets the remaining 20%, which is $200,000. I think this is a fair and generous starting point, and I hope Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A more balanced split 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, but I'll consider it.

Since the money is worth 10% less for me this round, $300,000 is equivalent to $270,000 in the previous round. And since Bob's money is worth 5% less, $700,000 is equivalent to $735,000 in the previous round.

I'm not getting a great deal here, but I'll decide to...
