Let's see if Bob will agree to this deal.  I'm going for a high share, but I still want to make it somewhat appealing to him in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is very unfair.  Even though the money is worth less for me, 1000 is very little.  I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split this time.  This is a fair deal, and hopefully, Bob will realize that it's better than the risk of getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
