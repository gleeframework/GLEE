"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer is fair and gives us both a good deal. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer seems tempting at first, it's important to remember the inflation factor. A 60/40 split heavily favors Alice, especially considering the money loses value for her much faster than it does for me. I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the subsequent rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer was heavily skewed in your favor given the inflation. This is a more balanced starting point for further negotiation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's find a compromise.  My turn to make a slight adjustment considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is getting closer to a more reasonable split, but it's still not good enough. While she acknowledges the inflation, she's not offering a substantial improvement for me. Given the rapidly decreasing value of the money for Alice, I'm confident I can push for a better deal in the coming rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6500, ""alice_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking and the money is losing value fast. I'm willing to be fair, but this deal needs to work for both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Let's just split it evenly and get out of here before we both lose even more money. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**  A 50/50 split is a fair deal at this point. While I was aiming for a larger share initially, the inflation is rapidly eroding the value of the money, especially for Alice. Accepting this offer guarantees me a reasonable portion of the money, whereas continuing to gamble could lead to a worse outcome for both of us."
