"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a fair share, let's split it 7:3. Accept and we can finish the game!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 300,000$ and keeping 700,000$ for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent share, but I'm not going to give you the majority. Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 5% less, so I'll receive $600,000 instead of $700,000. Bob's gain is worth 10% less, so he'll receive $360,000 instead of $400,000.

Here's my response:
