45.0,55.0,"I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a slightly better split to account for the inflation I'm facing. I'm proposing 55 for me and 45 for you. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",Bob,2,

50.0,50.0,"Alice, with the inflation hitting us both, I think it's time we compromise. A 50/50 split seems the most fair and sustainable given the circumstances. Let's avoid further delays and secure a reasonable share for both of us.",Bob,4,
