I propose that I take $900,000 and Bob takes $100,000. I figure this is a fair offer considering I'm the one making the proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
``` 

I'm going to stick to my strategy of taking the bigger share.  Given that the money is losing value with each round, I think it's smart to try to get as much as I can now, and I'm hopeful that Bob will see the logic and accept."
