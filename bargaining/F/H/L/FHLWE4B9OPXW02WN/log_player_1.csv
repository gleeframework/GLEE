Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we divide the money 3:2, but I'll start with a slightly more generous offer. This way, we can avoid the risk of inflation and still get a decent share. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
