Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time.  Inflation is a factor, but fairness is more important to me. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

""alice_gain"": 5463,

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm sticking with my previous offer.  Let's be fair and split the money evenly. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is completely ignoring the impact of inflation on my gains. While I value fairness, accepting a deal where I effectively lose significant value due to a factor outside my control isn't rational. I need to incentivize Bob to move closer to my offers."

Round 5

{
""alice_gain"": 5686,
""bob_gain"": 4314,
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your commitment to a 50/50 split, but the reality is that inflation is eating away at my share with each round. This isn't sustainable. My offer is a compromise to offset the losses I face due to inflation. Let's be practical and close this deal.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concerns about inflation.  I'm willing to compromise a little, but I still believe a 50/50 split is the fairest outcome.  This offer is a slight concession on my part, let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's latest offer shows he's finally acknowledging the impact of inflation, his concession is still too small. Accepting a 52/48 split after six rounds means I'm taking a significant loss compared to the real value of the money at the start. I need to hold firm and push for a more substantial adjustment in my favor."

Round 7

{
""alice_gain"": 5809,
""bob_gain"": 4191,
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for recognizing the impact of inflation. However, your offer still doesn't fully account for the value I'm losing with each passing round. This offer is a more realistic reflection of the situation, and it's important we reach a deal soon. Time is running out.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm trying to be fair while recognizing the impact of inflation.  This offer is a compromise,  let's find a way to make this work before it's too late. 
# Alice gain: 5400 
# Bob gain: 4600 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, we are getting close to the deadline, and the value of the deal for me keeps diminishing.  Bob's offer is better than a 50/50 split, but I need to push for a more significant concession while it's still possible to get a deal that is minimally acceptable."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6033,
""bob_gain"": 3967,
""message"": ""Bob, we're running out of time! This is my final offer. It's crucial we reach an agreement now to avoid both losing out completely. My offer factors in the significant impact inflation has had over these rounds. Let's be pragmatic and close the deal.""

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close to the end. I'm making a significant concession here.  This is my final offer. Let's avoid losing everything. 
# Alice gain: 5600 
# Bob gain: 4400 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  We've reached a critical point. With only two rounds left, the risk of walking away with nothing is very high. While Bob's offer isn't ideal, it's the best I'm likely to get at this late stage. Accepting this offer ensures I receive something, which is better than the alternative of both of us getting nothing."
