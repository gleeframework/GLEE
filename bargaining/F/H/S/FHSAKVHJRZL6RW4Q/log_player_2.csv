"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6500, ""alice_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be real.  I know you're feeling the inflation more than me. This offer lets me get ahead, but you still get a decent share.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to maximize your gains, but this offer is too far off from what I think is fair. Let's try to find a more balanced solution that benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is more reasonable, it's still heavily skewed in her favor considering the faster rate of inflation on her end.  I need to push for a better deal, but I need to be careful not to push her too far."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm trying to find a middle ground here.  This offer recognizes the inflation difference while still giving you a significant portion.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding a balance:** I'm aiming for a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but won't accept an uneven deal.
* **Highlighting inflation:** I'm reiterating the inflation disadvantage Alice faces, justifying a larger share for me.
* **Urgency without being aggressive:** The tone remains firm but not desperate, urging a decision without pushing her away."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're both losing money with each passing round.  Let's split this evenly and avoid further losses.  It's the most rational solution at this point. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is right. While a 50/50 split isn't ideal given the inflation rates, it's the most logical choice at this point.  Continuing to negotiate risks even greater losses for both of us.  It's better to secure a guaranteed win now than gamble on getting a slightly better deal later and potentially ending up with nothing."
