"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. This is a relatively equal split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it to get something rather than risking a worse deal in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, given we both have to deal with inflation.  What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of $4,000 is now worth $3,800 (95% of $4,000), and Bob's gain of $6,000 is now worth $4,800 (80% of $6,000).

I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I think it's a reasonable proposal given the circumstances. I'll accept the offer to get $3,800.
