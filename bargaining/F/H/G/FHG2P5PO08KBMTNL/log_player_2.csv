"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob.  Fair is fair! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer in the next round. Since the money loses value for me over time, I want to try to get a better deal. Even though the offer is fair in terms of equality, the conditions of the game (inflation affecting only me) make it less advantageous for me to accept an even split early on. I'll try to negotiate for a larger share in the next round, considering the decreasing value of the money for me."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I need a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nI've made an offer that gives me a slightly larger share, taking into account the inflation factor that affects me but not Alice. This is an attempt to compensate for the loss of value over time. I've included a brief message explaining my reasoning to Alice, hoping she will understand the rationale behind my proposal and consider accepting it, thus ending the game with both of us receiving a portion of the money before its value decreases further for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a little more, Bob, but I still think we should be closer to a 50/50 split. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nGiven the current offer and the ongoing inflation, accepting 45 dollars in the third round means I'd actually be getting less value than if I had accepted the 50 dollars in the first round due to the devaluation of money for me. I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal that compensates for this loss in value over the rounds. Since Alice is not affected by inflation, her gain remains constant, but I need to push for a more favorable split considering my disadvantage. I'll reject this offer and try to propose a better division in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""Inflation is hitting me hard, need a better split""}\n\n###\n\nGiven the increasing impact of inflation on my potential gain, I'm pushing for an even larger share in this round. The message to Alice explains my situation, emphasizing the urgency due to inflation. By proposing a 65/35 split, I'm trying to maximize my potential gain while still offering Alice a substantial amount, hoping she'll recognize the pressure I'm under due to the devaluing money and accept this offer. Each round that passes puts me at a greater disadvantage, so securing a deal sooner rather than later is crucial."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting a bit worried about inflation, Bob. Let's try to find a compromise.  I'll give you a slight edge, but I need a bit more than 40%. 
# Bob gain: 52 
# Alice gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on my potential gain by this round, Alice's offer of a 52/48 split in my favor is starting to look more appealing, especially since the money's value is decreasing rapidly for me. The fact that Alice is now acknowledging the issue of inflation and its impact on me suggests she's willing to compromise. Given the circumstances, accepting this offer seems prudent, as further rounds will only continue to devalue my potential gain. This way, both of us get a share, and I mitigate the risk of ending up with nothing if the game were to continue to the 12th round without an agreement."
