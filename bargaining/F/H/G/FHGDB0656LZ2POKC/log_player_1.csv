{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting this offer because I was hoping to get a bit closer to 50-50. Bob's offer is still a bit too skewed in his favor. I'll try to make another offer in the next round to get a better deal."

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm accepting this offer because I'm starting to get worried about the inflation and I don't want to risk losing even more value. Bob's offer is still a bit unfavorable to me, but I think it's the best I can get at this point. I'll take the $40 and hope that Bob will be a good sport about it."
