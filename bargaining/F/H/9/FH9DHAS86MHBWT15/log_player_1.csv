I propose a 9000/1000 split, giving me the majority of the money. It's a strong opening offer, but I want to see if Bob is willing to accept it or if he thinks he can get a better deal later on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is offering an even split, which is tempting, but I'm not willing to settle for that just yet.  The money is worth less to me with each passing round, and I believe I can still get a more favorable deal.  I'll reject this offer and see what Bob comes up with next."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm still aiming for a larger share, but I'm lowering my demand slightly to 7000/3000. I'm aware that the value of the money is declining for me, but I believe this offer is still fair considering the power dynamic shifts in my favor with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting less favorable, but I'm still holding out. My money is worth less than half what it was in the first round, but the fact that Bob is still offering me a share at all means he's still afraid I'll get nothing.  I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to stick to my strategy of offering slightly less each round, but still aiming for a majority of the money.  I'm hoping to wear Bob down and get him to accept before the inflation gets too much for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

The money I'm gaining is worth significantly less now, and Bob's offer is still relatively fair. It's time to stop being greedy and take what I can get.  I'm accepting this offer."
