Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic.  The inflation hurts you more than me. I'm willing to take a small step back from my initial offer, but 57/43 is the best I can do. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700
