"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, 60-40 is a fair split. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nReasoning: I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can get a better deal in the next round. Since the money is worth 20% less in each subsequent round, Alice has an incentive to make a more generous offer to avoid losing value. I'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's split it more evenly, 55-45 is more reasonable.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle of our previous offers. 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nReasoning: Although the money is worth less now, I think I can still get a better deal. Alice's offer is closer to my previous proposal, but I'm willing to take the risk of waiting another round to see if she'll make an even more generous offer. Since the value of the money is decreasing rapidly, Alice may become more eager to reach an agreement soon."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bit more. 52-48 is a fair split.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: It's getting ridiculous, let's just split it 50-50 already! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nReasoning: Given the rapid decrease in value, I think it's best to accept the 50-50 split now rather than risking further loss. At this point, getting half of the remaining value is better than possibly getting a slightly better deal in a future round, but with significantly less purchasing power."
