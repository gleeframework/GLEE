"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. Let's get this over with! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject this offer. Even though it's a lot of money right now, I know that with each round, the value of the money decreases more for Alice than it does for me. I can likely get a better deal later on."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 9000, ""alice_gain"": 1000, ""message"": ""I'm sure you'll appreciate the value of this offer in the coming rounds, Alice.  Let's get this done.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob.  I'm willing to compromise, but we need to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still going to reject this offer. While it's a better deal for me than her first offer, I believe I can still get a better deal with more rounds of negotiation. The inflation is working in my favor more than it is for Alice."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 8000, ""alice_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking.  Let's find a solution before the value of the money diminishes too much for both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer, Bob.  I'm not willing to go lower, but I'm also not willing to let this all go to waste.  Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm going to accept this offer.  The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, and while I could potentially get a slightly better deal in the future, it's not worth the risk of getting nothing at all.  This offer is reasonable, and it's time to end the negotiation."
