"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the $1,000,000, and you get 30%. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping you'll agree to accept it and we can move on to the next round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fair, let's start with this. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less due to inflation, my gain of $700,000 in the first round is now equivalent to $630,000.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'm not impressed with the 40-60 split. I think I can do better than that.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 10% less due to inflation again, my gain of $630,000 from the previous round is now equivalent to $567,000.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting closer, Bob, but I'm still the one with the skills to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which I think is a more reasonable compromise given the current market conditions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's just split it evenly. No more back and forth, please. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 27.1% less due to inflation, my gain of $567,000 from the previous round is now equivalent to $413,190.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'm not thrilled with the 50-50 split, but I'm willing to accept it since it's a relatively fair compromise, and I don't want to continue negotiating.
