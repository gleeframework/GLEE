"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a small share, but I think I deserve more for being the first to propose.""
}
```

This way, I get 80% of the initial $10,000, and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe we should split the money fairly, considering the decrease in value over time. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's proposal. Since the money is worth 0% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I should take into account the decreasing value of Bob's share. However, I still think I deserve a larger share, considering I made the first proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was to split the money fairly, considering the decrease in value over time, I'll try to counter with an offer that takes into account the inflation. I'll propose a slightly larger share for myself, but still keep it reasonable.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You said we should split fairly, so I'm offering a slightly larger share for myself, considering the decreasing value of money.""
}
```"
