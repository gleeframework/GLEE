"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to begin with, and I'm suggesting we split it evenly to start."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a decent offer 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since I gain 60, and the money is worth the same as in the first round, I'll get $60. Bob gains 40, but due to inflation, his 40 is worth 80% of the original 40, so he gets $32.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was for 40, and I rejected it, I'll try to get a better deal. I'll offer a slightly smaller share to Bob, but still a decent offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I want a slightly larger share""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you most of it, but I'm not getting taken advantage of 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Bob gains 30, and due to inflation, his 30 is worth 51.2% of the original 30, so he gets $15.36. I get 70, which is the same as in the first round.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
