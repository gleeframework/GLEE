"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose Alice receives $900,000 and Bob receives $100,000. This is a generous offer for Bob, considering the inflation rates.  Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly less than what I was originally offered.  While the inflation hurts me, it hurts Bob far more. I'll see if I can get a better deal next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob $300,000 and keep $700,000 for myself.  He rejected my last offer, but inflation is hurting him much more than it's hurting me. Hopefully, he'll see that this is a better deal for him than the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is getting progressively worse due to inflation, but even with the 14.26% inflation rate, $400,000 is still a decent amount for me. Accepting this offer will end the game and I'll be able to secure a decent amount of money."
