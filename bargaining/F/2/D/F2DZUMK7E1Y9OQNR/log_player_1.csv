"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $400,000, and I'll take the remaining $600,000. I'm framing it as a fair split, but we'll see how Bob responds!"
