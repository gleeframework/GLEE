"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI'll offer Bob 40% of the money, which is a relatively generous offer. Since the money loses value for Bob in each round, he might be inclined to accept this proposal rather than risking a worse offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering the inflation you'll face. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer because I think I can get a better deal in the next round. Since the money doesn't lose value for me, I have no incentive to rush into an agreement. Additionally, Bob is under pressure to make a deal due to the 20% decrease in value for him each round, so I'll try to use this to my advantage."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nI'll make a slightly more generous offer than before, considering the inflation that's affecting Bob's potential gain. Since Bob's offer in the previous round was a 60/40 split in his favor, I'll try to find a middle ground that's closer to my original offer but still acknowledges the pressure Bob is under due to inflation.\n{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet halfway""}\n\n###\n\nThis offer gives Bob a bit more than my original proposal, showing that I'm willing to compromise, but it still favors me, as I'm not under the same pressure from inflation."
