I'm starting with a pretty generous offer. I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm also aware that inflation is a factor here. We'll see how it goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer.  It's a clear power play, and I'm not going to let him get away with it.  I'll make a counter-offer in the next round.  I'm confident I can get a better deal than this."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

I'm offering a more balanced split this time. I think it's fair, and I'm hoping Bob will see reason and accept it.  Inflation is starting to bite, and we both need to work together to get something out of this deal."
