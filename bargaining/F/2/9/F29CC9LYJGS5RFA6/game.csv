55.0,45.0,"Hi Bob, let's start with a fair offer. I take $55, you get $45. It's better to settle now than lose money to inflation.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,I think we can both do a bit better than that.  I'm willing to give you a slight edge to settle this quickly. Let's split it 55/45 in my favor.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
50.0,50.0,"Bob, it's clear we both want to maximize our gains.  Let's stop wasting time with inflated offers and split it evenly. 50/50 - a fair deal before inflation eats away at it further.",Alice,3,
