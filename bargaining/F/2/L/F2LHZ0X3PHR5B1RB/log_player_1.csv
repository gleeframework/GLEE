Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a generous split to start. I figure Bob might be hesitant to reject such a large offer, especially as his money is devalued faster than mine. Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much less favorable to me than my initial offer, and while the value of the money has decreased, I'm still getting a larger percentage.  I'll reject this offer and see what happens next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to stick with a more balanced approach, aiming for a 70/30 split in my favor. The inflation is starting to kick in, but I don't want to be too greedy and risk Bob rejecting this offer as well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still less than half of the initial offer.  Despite the inflation, I'm still getting more than 50% of the money in my offer, and he's getting less than half.  I'll reject this and try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

Inflation is really starting to bite now, so I'm going to offer a slightly lower split than my previous one. Hopefully, Bob sees that the money will be worth much less for him in the next round, and he'll accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This offer is much better for me than any offer I could realistically get in the next round. While the money is worth less than in the beginning, it's still a pretty good deal for me considering the inflation we're facing.  I'll take it!"
