I propose to take 990,000$ and leave 10,000$ for Bob. I'm hoping he'll accept, as it's better than getting nothing if we reach the 12th round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer. While it's better than nothing, the inflation is making the money worth less, and I can still try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'm lowering my offer slightly to 900,000 for myself and 100,000 for Bob. This is still a significant gain for both of us, and with inflation increasing, I think it's a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. While it's getting better for me, the inflation is still making the money worth less, and I believe I can still get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm offering 800,000 for myself and 200,000 for Bob.  I'm willing to give Bob a bigger share this time to try and get the deal done. The inflation is starting to bite, and we are both taking losses on the deal with each passing round."
