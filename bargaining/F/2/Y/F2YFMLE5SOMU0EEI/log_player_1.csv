"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a division of $55 for myself and $45 for Bob, with a message suggesting that this is a relatively fair split, but with me taking a slightly larger share. Since the value of money doesn't decrease for me but does for Bob with each round, I'm incentivized to try and reach an agreement sooner rather than later. By offering Bob a significant amount, I'm hoping he will accept this proposal in the first round to avoid further devaluation of his potential gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn to propose a fair split. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer because, although he suggests it's a fair split, the division of $45 for me and $55 for him is less favorable to me than my initial proposal. Given that the value of money remains constant for me but decreases for Bob with each round, I have no immediate incentive to accept an offer that gives me less than what I initially proposed. By rejecting, I'll wait for the next round, hoping to either get a better offer or make a new proposal that might be more in my favor."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, this is a generous offer""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I'll increase my proposed share to $60 and decrease Bob's share to $40. Given that the value of money decreases by 5% for Bob with each round, the actual value he would receive is less than the nominal amount. By framing this as a ""generous offer"" considering the inflation, I'm hoping to persuade Bob that accepting this deal now is better than risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds. This strategy takes into account the time pressure exerted by the inflation mechanism on Bob's decision-making."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is eating our profits! Let's split it evenly and end this. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI'll accept Bob's offer to split the $100 evenly, with each of us getting $50. Although I previously sought to maximize my gain, considering Bob's decreasing value due to inflation and his willingness to settle for an even split to end the game, I find this offer reasonable. It's also the first time Bob has offered a 50/50 split, indicating he's willing to compromise significantly due to the pressure from inflation. Accepting this offer ensures I receive a substantial amount without risking further negotiations that could lead to an impasse or less favorable terms."
