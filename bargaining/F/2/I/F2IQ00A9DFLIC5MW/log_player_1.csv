"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

Let's see if Bob takes my generous offer!  I'm hoping to get most of the money in the first round, as inflation will make the money worth less with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is pretty fair, but I'm still holding out for more!  I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round, even with the inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm going to try to push for a slightly better deal than Bob's offer, but still leaving something on the table to encourage him to accept.  I'm hoping that after rejecting my last offer, he'll be more willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even with the inflation, I'm still not happy with this offer. I'm confident that I can secure a better deal in the next round. I'll make another proposal and hopefully reach a more equitable agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to try a slightly higher offer than Bob's last one.  I'm getting a little worried about the inflation, but I still think I can get a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is getting pretty bad, but I'm still not willing to settle. I believe I can do better in the next round. I'll try to negotiate a more favorable split before the inflation takes away too much of my potential gain."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm going to offer an even split.  I'm getting a little concerned about how much money I'm losing to inflation, and I think this is the best way to ensure we both get something."
