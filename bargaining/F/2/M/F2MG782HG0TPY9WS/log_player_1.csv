I'm going to start with a generous offer, hoping to get this over with quickly.  900,000 for me and 100,000 for Bob.  Let's see if he's willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being greedy! I'll reject his offer and see if he's willing to negotiate more fairly in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000}
```

I'll propose a 450,000/550,000 split.  I'm still losing some value from inflation, but I'm hoping this is a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being ridiculously stubborn! I'll reject his offer again.  At this rate, I'll be lucky to get anything at all.  I'll see if he's finally willing to negotiate in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 300000, ""bob_gain"": 700000}
```

I'm getting desperate now, but I'm still holding out for something better than what Bob is offering. 300,000 for me, 700,000 for him. Hopefully, this is enough to get him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Okay, Bob is clearly not going to budge. This offer is way better than what I'd get if we keep going. I'm accepting it.  It's a shame I lost so much potential value due to the inflation, but at least I'm getting something."
