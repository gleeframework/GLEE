Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing a waiting game, counting on Bob's fear of inflation to force him to accept a bad deal. While the offer is slightly better, it's crucial for Bob to show strength and that he won't be bullied into an unfair agreement."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 48,
""alice_gain"": 52,
""message"": ""This is my final offer. Take it or leave it - a deal benefits us both more than nothing.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** With only 6 rounds remaining, the pressure is mounting.  Both players are losing potential gains with each passing round.
* **Show of Strength:** Offering 48% shows a willingness to compromise slightly from a 50/50 split, but also demonstrates firmness.
* **Ultimatum:**  The ""take it or leave it"" language signals that Bob is serious and won't be swayed by further negotiation tactics.  This can push Alice to accept a reasonable offer rather than risk getting nothing."
