"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, giving me the larger share, but still leaving Bob with a significant amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth less due to inflation, I'm not as eager to give up as much as I was in the first round. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate for a better deal.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the money is worth even less now due to inflation, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a better deal. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm aiming for a 55-45 split, trying to take a larger share of the remaining money."
