"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 3:1. This is fair considering the risk and value of money diminishing with each round. 
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While 2500 is something, I want more. I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think 6000 for me and 4000 for you is a fair split, considering the risk of losing value in the next round.  Let's settle this now.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I propose we split it evenly. This way, both of us get a fair share without risking more value in the next round. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While 50/50 isn't ideal, the risk of losing more value in the next round is too high. I'll take the 4000 and move on."
