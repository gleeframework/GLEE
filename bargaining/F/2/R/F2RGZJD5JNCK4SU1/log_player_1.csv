"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly, 60% for me, 40% for you.""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering Bob 40% of the money, which is a relatively generous offer, and I'm hoping he'll accept it to avoid further rounds and potential losses due to inflation. The message is brief and to the point, emphasizing the fairness of the split.\n\nPlease let me know Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your split is fair in principle Alice, but the value of the money decreases for both of us each round. I propose a slightly better split for me to account for this. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, although he claims the split is fair, it's actually less favorable to me than my initial proposal. Additionally, the inflation only affects me, not Bob, so his argument about the value of money decreasing for both of us is incorrect. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round.\n\nPlease let me know the outcome!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""I understand your concerns about inflation, but it only affects me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better split. 58% for me, 42% for you is my new offer.""}\n\nI'm making a slightly more generous offer than my initial one, but still trying to account for the fact that inflation only affects me. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and accept it.\n\nPlease let me know Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we are starting to waste rounds. This offer is a compromise that gives you a significantly larger share, but also takes into account that the value of the deal diminishes with every round, even if only for you. 
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, although he claims it's a compromise, the split is still less favorable to me than my previous proposals. Additionally, the inflation is indeed affecting me, but I'm not desperate yet. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round, trying to find a better balance between our gains.\n\nPlease let me know the outcome!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 560000, ""bob_gain"": 440000, ""message"": ""I understand we're running out of rounds, but I still need a better split. 56% for me, 44% for you is my new offer. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to account for the inflation affecting me.""}\n\nI'm making another slightly more generous offer than my previous one, trying to find a balance between our gains. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and accept it, considering we're running out of rounds.\n\nPlease let me know Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be real. This back and forth is pointless. I'm offering a perfectly even split to end this now before we both lose out. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI'm accepting Bob's offer because, considering the significant impact of inflation on my potential gain, a 50/50 split is a reasonable compromise at this point. Further rounds would only decrease my gain, and I'd risk losing out on a substantial amount. It's better to secure $500,000 now than to gamble on a potentially worse outcome in the remaining rounds.\n\nLet's conclude the game!"
