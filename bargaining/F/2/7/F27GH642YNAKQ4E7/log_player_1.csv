Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more than before, but I'm still looking for a fair share. Let's make this work! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is getting greedier, and the value of the money is dropping fast.  I need to hold out for a better deal, even if it means taking a risk in later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Let's just split it evenly and call it a day. It's not worth losing even more to inflation.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  

Time to play hardball. An even split is the fairest offer, and it avoids further losses for both of us. By now, Bob should realize that dragging this out only hurts us both."
