"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where each of us gets $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not happy with the offer, but I'll consider it.

Since the money is worth 20% less, I'll need to adjust my thinking. In this round, $4000 is equivalent to $5000 in the previous round, and $6000 is equivalent to $7500.

I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in Round 3.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500}

I'm proposing a slightly more favorable split, where I get $4,500 and Bob gets $5,500."
