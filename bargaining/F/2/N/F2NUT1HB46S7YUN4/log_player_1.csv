"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $100,000, and I'll take the rest.""
}
```

This way, I'm giving Bob a relatively small amount, but still a significant portion of the total. The message is a friendly one, trying to set a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent share, but I think I deserve more for being the one to make the next offer 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 400000 * 0.9 = 360000
* Bob gain: 600000

I'll decide to reject this offer, since I'm getting a smaller share than I did in the first round, and I think I can do better. 

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. I'll take a smaller share, but I think this is a fair split.""
}
```

This time, I'm offering Bob a smaller share, but still a significant portion of the total. The message is a friendly one, trying to convey that I'm willing to meet in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think I deserve more for holding out so far 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 27.1% less due to inflation, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 200000 * 0.7279 = 145380.8
* Bob gain: 800000

I'll decide to reject this offer, since the amount I'd get is relatively small and I think I can do better.

  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to give up much more. This is my final offer. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

This time, I'm offering Bob a smaller share, but still a significant portion of the total. The message is a bit more assertive, trying to convey that I'm not willing to negotiate further."
