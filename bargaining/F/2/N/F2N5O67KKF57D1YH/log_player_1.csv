"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering the inflation, my gain of 5000 is actually worth 4000 in the first round's terms.

I'll reject this offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation has already reduced the value of the money, I'll aim to get a larger share this time. Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}"
