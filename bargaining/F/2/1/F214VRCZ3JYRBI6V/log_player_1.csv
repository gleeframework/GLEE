"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Meet in the middle, no need to negotiate""
}
```

This is a fair and straightforward proposal, offering Bob a 50/50 split of the $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, let's be fair 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 5% less, the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: $400,000 x 0.95 = $380,000
Bob gain: $600,000 x 0.95 = $570,000

I don't think I'm being too greedy, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
