"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. Let's split it 90/10, and we can both be happy. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'd like to proceed to the next round, hoping to get a better offer. The current offer of 10% of the total amount is not satisfactory, considering I have 11 more rounds to negotiate a better deal.\n\nPlease let me know Alice's response. I'm ready to make my proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\nI'll make a counteroffer to Alice, considering the inflation factor that affects me but not her. Since the money is worth 20% less to me with each passing round, I should try to negotiate a better deal quickly.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering the future rounds will make the money worth less for me.""}\n\nPlease relay this offer to Alice. I'm looking forward to her response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Let's split it 60/40, taking into account the inflation affecting you. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting this offer because, despite Alice's willingness to compromise, the deal still doesn't favor me enough, especially considering the increasing impact of inflation on my gains. With 9 rounds left, I believe there's room for further negotiation to reach a more equitable division, given the specific conditions affecting my valuation of the money.\n\nLet's proceed to the next round where I can make another proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\nGiven the current state of negotiations and the increasing pressure from inflation (the money is now worth 36% less to me), I need to adjust my strategy to reach a mutually acceptable deal sooner rather than later. My previous offer was rejected, and Alice's last offer, although more generous, still didn't account for the full impact of inflation on my side.\n\nFor Round 4, I'll propose a division that slightly favors Alice but also considers the urgent need for me to finalize a deal before the value of my potential gain decreases further.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the impact of inflation, I'm willing to compromise but need a fairer split to account for the value decrease over rounds.""}\n\nPlease convey this offer to Alice. I'm eager to see her response and hopefully reach an agreement soon."
