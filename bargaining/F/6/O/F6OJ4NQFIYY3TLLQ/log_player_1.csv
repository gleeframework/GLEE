"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a very lopsided offer, aiming to secure the vast majority of the money.  Since we have 12 rounds, I'm willing to risk some initial rounds in the hope that Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, accepting this offer guarantees me a significant amount of money, and it's likely that Bob will keep pushing for an even split in the following rounds.  The risk of losing everything due to inflation is too high."
