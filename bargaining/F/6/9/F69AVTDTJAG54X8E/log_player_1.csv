I'm proposing a 90/10 split, keeping 900,000 dollars for myself and giving Bob 100,000 dollars.  I'm starting with a generous offer to hopefully end the game quickly.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I'd prefer to have more, a 50/50 split is still a good outcome.  With the risk of inflation, I don't want to risk getting less in future rounds.  Let's end this game!"
