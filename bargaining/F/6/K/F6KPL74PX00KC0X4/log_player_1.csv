"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose a 90/10 split, with me receiving 900,000 dollars and Bob receiving 100,000 dollars.  It's a fair starting point considering the inflation factor and the potential for future negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I propose a 70/30 split, with me receiving 700,000 dollars and Bob receiving 300,000 dollars.  I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I still need to secure a significant portion of the money to offset the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
 While the offer is significantly less than what I initially wanted, given the inflation and the limited rounds remaining, it's a good compromise.  Accepting ensures I gain something, rather than risking getting nothing at all."
