Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the bigger share, but you'll get something too. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm not going to accept a deal where I get only 100,000. I want a better deal, and I know Alice's offer is not going to get any better with inflation working against her.  Let's see what she offers next round."
