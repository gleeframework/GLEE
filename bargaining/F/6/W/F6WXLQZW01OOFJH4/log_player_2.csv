Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said 52/48 was your final offer, but I'm willing to compromise a bit more. Take it or leave it! 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Reasoning:

The value of waiting any longer is getting very low due to the steep inflation penalty.  While not ideal, taking Alice's offer results in a better outcome than waiting another round and likely getting a worse offer.
