I'm taking a very large share initially, as there's a high chance Bob will accept this in the first round to avoid the risk of getting nothing.  Let's see what Bob does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is a good deal for me! I'm getting half the money, which is far more than I would have gotten if we had kept playing and risked ending up with nothing."
