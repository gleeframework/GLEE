"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to offer Bob a small share, hoping he'll accept it quickly. This is a very risky strategy, but I need to maximize my gain before inflation kicks in."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While my gains are much lower than in round 1, it's still a significant amount, and the risk of inflation is high. I don't want to risk getting even less in the next round."
