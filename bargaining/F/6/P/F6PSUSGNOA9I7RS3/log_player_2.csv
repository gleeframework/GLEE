Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm losing money with every round, and we need to settle this soon. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting desperate, and her offers are getting worse for her. While the difference is only $200 from her last offer, the trend is in my favor. The longer the game goes, the more desperate she'll become, and the better my position.  I'm willing to push my luck a bit further."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm offering a significant increase from my last offer. We need to reach an agreement soon.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** With each round, the pressure on Alice increases due to the inflation affecting her share. 
* **Shifting Balance:** My rejections are signaling that I'm willing to risk it all, which should make Alice more willing to compromise. 
* **Appearing Reasonable:** By increasing my offer, I appear flexible and reasonable, which might nudge Alice towards accepting."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer. Take it or leave it. The clock is ticking and we both lose if this drags on. 
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:** Alice's language (""final offer"", ""take it or leave it"") indicates strong resolve and a high likelihood she won't budge further.
* **Diminishing Returns:** While not ideal, accepting guarantees me $4,600.  Rejecting and hoping for a better offer in later rounds carries significant risk. Alice's increasing losses make it more likely she'll stick to her guns, even if it means losing everything.
* **Time Pressure:** With only 5 rounds remaining, the risk of walking away with nothing is very real. It's better to secure a reasonable amount now than gamble on an uncertain future."
