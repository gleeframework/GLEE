Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to compromise. Let's do 70/30. This way, we both get a decent share, and we can avoid losing more money to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're losing money with each round. Let's be practical and split it 65/35.  It's a fair deal that ensures we both get something. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is getting closer to a more even split, time is on her side. Accepting this offer would mean losing a significant amount to inflation. Bob should hold out for a better deal in the next couple of rounds."
