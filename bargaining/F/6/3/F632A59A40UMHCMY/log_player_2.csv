Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the inflation. Let's start with that.""}

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, that's a tough deal for me. How about we meet in the middle a bit? This offer considers the inflation but is still fair for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
