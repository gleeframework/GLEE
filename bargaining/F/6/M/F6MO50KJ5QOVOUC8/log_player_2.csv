{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Your offer was a bit too much in your favor, Alice. How about a 55/45 split?  It's still in your favor considering the inflation, but closer to a fair deal.""}

# Alice's message: Let's try a 50/50 split this time. It's more fair and we can both get a decent amount even with the inflation.

# Alice gain: 50
