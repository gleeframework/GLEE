"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for Bob, I'll consider the offer in terms of the original amount. If Bob's 40 is worth 80% of the original amount, I'll consider it as 40/0.8 = 50.

My gain would be 60, which is more than the 50 I initially proposed. I'll accept this offer.
