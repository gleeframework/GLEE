{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take 60 and you can take 40.""}

# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about the 50/50 split, especially since I'm already getting less value due to inflation. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal. I'll reject this offer and hope to do better in the next round!"

# Alice gain: 65 
# Bob gain: 35 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about the 35-65 split, but I'm also not willing to accept it. I'm getting less value due to inflation, and I think I can do better. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate for a better deal in the next round."

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm getting a bit concerned about the inflation too, and I think Bob's offer is a decent compromise. I'm not thrilled about giving up 32, but I think it's a fairer split than previous offers. I'll accept this offer and hope that it's the best we can get."
