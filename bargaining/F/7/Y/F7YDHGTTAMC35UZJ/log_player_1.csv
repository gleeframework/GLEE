Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a very unfair split, but I believe Bob will accept it. Since I get almost all the money, and the money is worth nothing to Bob in the next round, it's in his best interest to take the single dollar."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I would prefer to keep more, a 50/50 split is fair and ensures I get a decent amount. With each round, Bob's money is worth less, so it is unlikely he will offer me a better split in the next round."
