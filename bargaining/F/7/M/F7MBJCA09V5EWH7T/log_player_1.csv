"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can both go home happy!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is still a significant amount, considering the money will be worth less with each passing round. My message is a gentle nudge to encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair to split the money evenly, given that I'm taking the risk of losing value in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to be fair, but I'm not convinced. My gain is still $600,000, which is more than I offered in the first round. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I think you're being a bit too generous, Bob. I'm not willing to accept an uneven split yet.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 20% less for Bob now, I'll try to make a more attractive offer. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""A slight adjustment to my previous offer. I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not getting any younger!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $450,000, which is still a decent amount, considering the decreasing value of the money. My message is a lighthearted way of saying that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not going to give away the entire fortune."
