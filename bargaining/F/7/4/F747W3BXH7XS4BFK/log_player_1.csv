"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000} 
```

I'm taking a large share, but leaving a small amount for Bob. This is to incentivize him to accept, knowing that if he rejects my offer, he'll have to make a proposal in the next round, where the money will be worth less for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 950000, ""bob_gain"": 50000} 
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share than before, but still keeping the majority for myself. This is because the money is worth less for me with each passing round, and I want to incentivize him to accept before the value decreases even further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While the offer is not ideal, the money I'm getting is worth significantly less than in the first round due to inflation. Accepting this offer is the best option to avoid further losses."
