Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is the best I can do. You're right, we're running out of time, and this is a fair deal considering the circumstances. Let's settle this now and both walk away with something.

**Reasoning:**

Although I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, it's the same offer I made in Round 1, and the value is decreasing rapidly for me. Accepting now guarantees me a reasonable share, whereas continuing to negotiate risks getting nothing at all if we don't reach an agreement in the next 6 rounds."
