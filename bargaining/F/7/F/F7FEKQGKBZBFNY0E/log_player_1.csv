"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a fair share, let's end it here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 ratio in my favor, which is a generous offer considering the initial amount is $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50 and move on! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The offer from Bob is a 50/50 split, which is a reasonable proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to make a counteroffer, as I think I can do better than a 50/50 split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting a bit desperate, aren't you?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 7:3 ratio in my favor, but I'm willing to give Bob a slightly larger share than in my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not desperate yet, but I'll give you a slightly better offer. Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth significantly less now, but I'll still try to negotiate.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better. I'll make a counteroffer, trying to take advantage of the fact that Bob is still giving me a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now, but I'll try to make the most of it.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""You're running out of time, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 6:4 ratio in my favor, trying to squeeze out a slightly better deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up yet! I'll give you a slightly better offer. It's now or never! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth significantly less now, and I'm starting to feel the pinch. However, I'll still try to squeeze out a bit more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do even better. I'll make a counteroffer, trying to take advantage of the fact that Bob is getting closer to the end of his rope."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is almost worthless at this point, but I'll try to make one last push.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""You've pushed me to the limit, Bob. This is my final offer.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, trying to end the game on a somewhat equal note."
