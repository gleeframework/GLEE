"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $400,000 and keep $600,000 for myself. The message ""Let's be reasonable"" is a hint to Bob that this is a fair offer, considering the inflation that will occur in subsequent rounds, and that he should accept it to avoid losing more value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the money is losing value each round. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer because, although the money is losing value for Bob, I think I can still get a better deal in the next round. Since the money doesn't lose value for me, I have more negotiating power. I'll try to make a counteroffer in the next round that is more favorable to me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll make an offer that takes into account the decreasing value of money for Bob. Since Bob is losing 10% of the value each round, I'll try to find a middle ground that is still favorable to me but also considers Bob's losses.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Considering your loss, this is a good deal""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $350,000 and keep $650,000 for myself. The message ""Considering your loss, this is a good deal"" acknowledges the fact that Bob is losing value each round and frames this offer as a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer.  I'm taking a significant loss with each round, and I need to make sure I get a decent share. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer because, despite Bob's message stating it's his final offer and the significant loss he's taking, I still believe I can negotiate a better deal. Since the money doesn't lose value for me, I have the upper hand in the negotiation. Bob's desperation might lead him to accept a less favorable offer in the next round rather than risk losing even more value. I'll try to make another counteroffer that benefits me more."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll make an offer that still favors me but acknowledges Bob's growing desperation due to the increasing loss of value. Since Bob is now facing a significant reduction in value, I'll offer him a slightly better deal than before but still prioritize my own gain.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""This is as good as it gets""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $300,000 and keep $700,000 for myself. The message ""This is as good as it gets"" is a firm stance, indicating that I'm not willing to compromise further, which might persuade Bob to accept this offer rather than risk losing even more value in subsequent rounds."
