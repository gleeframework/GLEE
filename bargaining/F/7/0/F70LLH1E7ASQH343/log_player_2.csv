{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think it's fair to take into account the inflation that's happening.  How about we split it 60/40?  That way we both get a little more than half.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, I think 55/45 is a fair split. It's not too far off from 50/50, but it gives me a bit more to account for the loss in value. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
