"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll start with 60-40""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me $6,000 and Bob $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started with 60-40, I'll counter with 80-20, let's see if you accept 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, the actual amount I'd get from Bob's offer is $1,900 (2000 x 0.95).

I'll reject Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the previous round, so it's worth 0.95^2 = 0.9025 of the original amount.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You went up to 80-20, I'll counter with 55-45, let's meet in the middle""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, giving me $5,500 and Bob $4,500."

# Bob's message: You went to 55-45, I'll meet you there, let's finalize the deal 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 14.26% less due to inflation, the actual amount I'd get from Bob's offer is $3,876.50 (4500 / 1.1426).
