"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing to split the $10,000 evenly between us, with each of us getting $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You got a better offer, now it's your turn to make a better one! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll need to adjust my thinking. Considering the new offer, I'm not thrilled about giving Bob a bigger share, but I'm also not sure if I can do better.

For now, I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer.

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but don't expect it to last!""}

I'm offering Bob a slightly bigger share, but still trying to keep a bit more for myself. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I can see it! Make a better offer or I'll take this one! 
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on me!

Considering the new offer, I'm not thrilled about giving Bob such a big share, but I'm also worried that if I reject it, the next offer might be even worse.

For now, I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
