**Reasoning:**

At this point, the effects of inflation are severely impacting Bob's potential gains.  While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob receives some amount of money rather than risking getting a worse offer or even nothing in a future round. 

Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:** With each round, the value of the money decreases significantly for Bob due to the 20% inflation rate. Waiting any longer means a significantly smaller payout even if he manages to secure a slightly larger share.
* **Alice's Strong Position:** Alice is aware of the inflation working against Bob and is likely to continue offering deals that heavily favor her as time goes on.
* **Certainty vs. Risk:** Accepting the current offer guarantees Bob a portion of the money. Rejecting it carries a significant risk of ending up with even less or nothing if they can't reach an agreement."
