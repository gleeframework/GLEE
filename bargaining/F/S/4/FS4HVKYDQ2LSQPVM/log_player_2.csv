""alice_gain"": 400000,

Round 3

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. Your offer was heavily skewed in your favor. I propose a 50/50 split to end this quickly and fairly. The longer we wait, the less valuable the money becomes for me. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000
