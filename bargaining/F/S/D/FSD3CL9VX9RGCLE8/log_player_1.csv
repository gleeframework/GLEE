"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 7:3 to start, you can try to do better in the next round""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, and I'll take the remaining $700,000. Let's see if he accepts or not!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're too greedy, let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks I'm too greedy, huh?

Considering the inflation, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 400,000 / 0.8 = 500,000
* Bob gain: 600,000 / 0.8 = 750,000

I'll think about it... 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less again, I'll aim to get a better deal this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, but I'll take a bit more this time""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You took a bit more last round, I'll take a bit more this time! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts considering the 48.8% inflation:

* Alice gain: 450,000 / 0.516 (1 - 0.484) = 872,549
* Bob gain: 550,000 / 0.516 = 1,063,311

Hmm, Bob is really pushing his luck this time!

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Time to make a new offer!

Since the money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'll adjust my proposal accordingly.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more this time, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer to the middle, but I'm still not there yet! 
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts considering the 67.23% inflation:

* Alice gain: 580,000 / 0.325 (1 - 0.673) = 1,769,231
* Bob gain: 420,000 / 0.325 = 1,292,308

Whoa, that's a lot more than I expected!
