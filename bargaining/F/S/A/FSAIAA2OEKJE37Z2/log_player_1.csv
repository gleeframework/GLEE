I'm going for a slightly uneven split, hoping to get a good chunk of the money while still being fair enough to entice Bob into accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. It's not fair, and I believe I can do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
``` 

This time I'm offering a more balanced split, hoping to find a middle ground and reach an agreement."
