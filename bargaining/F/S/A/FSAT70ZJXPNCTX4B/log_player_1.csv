This is a tough one! While I'd ideally like a bit more, accepting Bob's offer is the safest play now. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The longer this goes on, the less my potential gains are worth. Waiting any longer is getting risky.
* **Bob's Stance:** Bob seems to be sticking close to the 50/50 split. There's no guarantee he'll offer anything better, and I risk getting a worse deal later."
