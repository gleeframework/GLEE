Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You got a good one last time, now it's my turn to get a better deal! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, let's split it 80/20, it's a fair deal! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While it's a significantly worse deal than what I initially offered,  the inflation is making it much less appealing to keep rejecting offers.  I'm taking the 20% now to avoid further losses."
