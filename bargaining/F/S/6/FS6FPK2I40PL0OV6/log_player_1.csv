I'm going for a bold strategy here, Alice. I'm confident Bob will accept, but if he doesn't, I'll adjust my offer in the next round."

This offer is still ridiculous. I'm losing more and more each round due to inflation, but I'm not giving up. I'm holding out for a fair deal.  The longer this goes on, the more pressure will be on Bob."

Okay, I'm accepting the offer.  I'm losing a huge amount due to inflation, and I'm not sure how much longer I can keep rejecting offers.  It's better to take something than nothing at this point.  This was a bad strategy on my part."
