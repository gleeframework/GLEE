"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'm willing to compromise.""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leave $4,000 for Bob. I'm framing it as a fair split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were willing to compromise, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's split it down the middle. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is affecting me more than Bob, it seems!

Considering the offer, I think Bob is trying to take advantage of the situation. Splitting it down the middle might not be the best deal for me, considering the decreasing value of money.

# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll on me now!

Considering Bob's message, it seems he's trying to be more generous, but still wants to take advantage of the situation. I'm not sure if I'm willing to accept a smaller share, especially since the money is worth less and less with each round.

However, I don't want to give up too much more, so I'll think carefully before making a decision.

Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to make a final stand. Considering the massive inflation and the decreasing value of money, I'm not sure if I can afford to reject this offer.

However, I still think I can get a better deal. The money is worth less and less with each round, and I'm not sure if I can trust Bob's ""last offer"".
