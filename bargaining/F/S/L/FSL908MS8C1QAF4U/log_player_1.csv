Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a pretty standard offer. Since I'm the first to propose, I'm going to try to get the majority of the money. But, I don't want to be too greedy and risk Bob rejecting my offer.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though the money is worth less to me now, Bob's offer is significantly more favorable than what I proposed in the first round. It's better to accept and secure at least something than risk getting nothing in the next round."
