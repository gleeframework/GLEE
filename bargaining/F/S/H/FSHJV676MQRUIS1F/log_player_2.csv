I'll reject this offer. I want to see if I can get a better deal!"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than an even split. How about I take $6000, and you get $4000?""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, let's aim for a more balanced distribution. I propose we each take $5000. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll accept this offer. Even with inflation, I'm still getting a decent amount, and I'm not sure I can get a better deal in the next round."
