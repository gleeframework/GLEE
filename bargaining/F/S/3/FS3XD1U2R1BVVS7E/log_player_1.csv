"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, seems fair to me!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 40% share, which is a relatively generous offer considering the game is just starting. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can wrap up the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 7,000 is a fair share for me, but I'm willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is already taking a bite!

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about giving him 70% of the remaining amount, but I'm willing to compromise. Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer, hoping it'll be more favorable for me!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Time for my next move!

Considering the effects of inflation, my offer is now worth 10% less than in the previous round. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need a better share for myself to make it worth my while!""
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive this time, but still leaving room for negotiation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a reasonable compromise 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is really taking a toll on my gains!

Considering Bob's offer, I'm still not thrilled about giving him a larger share, but I'm willing to accept it since it's getting late in the game and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a smaller share due to further inflation. Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the 35% share and hope it's enough to cover my losses from the inflation!"
