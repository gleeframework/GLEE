"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, Bob, but considering the inflation affecting you more, I propose taking a slightly larger share. 
# Bob gain: 4500

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5400,
""alice_gain"": 4600,
""message"": ""Alice, I understand the inflation puts me at a disadvantage. However, your offer was quite far from an even split. Let's be a bit more realistic. This is my counter-offer.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want a reasonable deal. I'm adjusting my offer closer to the middle ground, acknowledging the inflation impact on your share. This seems like a fair compromise. 
# Bob gain: 4900 
# Alice gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
