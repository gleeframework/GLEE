"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to negotiate if you want more.""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leaving $4,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly larger share since I'm the one making the proposal this time. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my $6,000 gain from the first round is now worth 90% of its original value, so I'd actually get $5,400 if I accepted the original offer.

Considering Bob's offer, I'd get $5,000, which is slightly less than the adjusted value of my original offer. However, I'd rather not risk going to the next round and losing even more value due to inflation. I'll accept Bob's offer.
