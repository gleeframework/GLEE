"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering a fair split, with a slight advantage for me.  Let's start things off right! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's too early to accept such a lopsided offer. Let's see what Alice offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I'm offering a more balanced split, recognizing that the money will depreciate with each round. Let's find a solution that benefits us both.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a larger share to account for the inflation affecting me more than you. Let's work towards a solution that's fair to both of us. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still not ideal, but the inflation is a real concern. Accepting this offer ensures some gains for me and limits the potential losses from further rounds."
