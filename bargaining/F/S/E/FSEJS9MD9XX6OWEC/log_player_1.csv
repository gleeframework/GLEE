# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not concerned about the inflation effect. However, I'm not thrilled about the 40/60 split either.

I'll reject this offer for now and try to negotiate further. Here's my response:
