"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is a fair starting point. Let's see if we can find a better deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While the offer isn't terrible,  I know I can negotiate a better deal.  It's worth seeing if Alice is willing to budge.  Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 40, ""alice_gain"": 60, ""message"": ""I think this is a more fair split.  We both get a good share, and we don't have to worry about the money depreciating further.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still think we can find a better split for both of us. Let's keep talking. 
# Bob gain: 20 
# Alice gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While I appreciate Alice's willingness to compromise, the offer is still too lopsided. I'm still holding out for a better deal for myself, and I'm confident I can get it."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, Alice.  Let's meet in the middle and both walk away with a good amount of money. Time is running out, and the money is losing value.""}
