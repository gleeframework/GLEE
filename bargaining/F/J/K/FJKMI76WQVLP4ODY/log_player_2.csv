Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bit more. 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm rejecting because I think I can get a better deal than 43% after further rounds of negotiation. Alice is showing she's willing to compromise, and the shrinking pot will make her more amenable to a fairer split.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still willing to compromise, but I won't go below 55. Inflation is hurting both of us. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a tough one, but I think it's time to accept. Here's why:

* **Shrinking Pie:** With each round, the value of the money decreases significantly. Waiting longer means we're both getting less. 
* **Alice's Stance:**  Alice seems firm on getting at least 55%. Accepting now guarantees I get something, while continuing to push risks getting even less if she remains stubborn. 

It's not ideal, but in this situation, cutting my losses and securing 45% of the (shrinking) pie is the most logical choice."
