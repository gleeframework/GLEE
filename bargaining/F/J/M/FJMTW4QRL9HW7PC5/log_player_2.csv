Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire for a better deal, but I believe a more equitable split is in our best interest. Let's aim for 60/40, where I get 60 and you get 40. This allows us both to benefit while acknowledging the value inflation.

# Alice gain: 60
