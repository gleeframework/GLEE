"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the $100 and Bob gets 40%. This seems like a fair starting point, but I'm open to negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of 70 is actually worth 70 * 0.95 = 66.5 in the first round's value, and Bob's gain of 30 is worth 30 * 0.8 = 24 in the first round's value.

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, considering the value of my gain is actually less than in the previous round. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the $100, which is a slightly more aggressive offer than before."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the effective values considering the inflation:

My gain of 75 is worth 75 * (1 - 0.1426) = 64.695 in the first round's value.
Bob's gain of 25 is worth 25 * (1 - 0.488) = 12.9 in the first round's value.

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, considering the value of my gain is still lower than in the previous round. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 85,
  ""bob_gain"": 15
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 85% of the $100, which is an even more aggressive offer than before."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 78 
# Bob gain: 22 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the effective values considering the inflation:

My gain of 78 is worth 78 * (1 - 0.2262) = 58.2318 in the first round's value.
Bob's gain of 22 is worth 22 * (1 - 0.6723) = 6.9566 in the first round's value.

Considering the values, I think this offer is slightly more favorable to me than the previous one, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll accept this offer.
