"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonably fair split. I get slightly more to account for potential future losses due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 5% less for me in each subsequent round, I'd like to try to get a better deal before the value decreases further. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'd like a slightly larger share to compensate for the loss in value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. I'm taking a risk with inflation each round. I need a better deal than that to accept. 
# Bob gain: 4900 
# Alice gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlthough Alice's offer is slightly better than the previous one, I still think I can get a more favorable deal. Since the money is worth 9.75% less for me now, I want to try to maximize my gain before the value decreases further. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""With the increasing inflation, I need a larger share to offset the loss in value. This is my most generous offer so far.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Let's just split it evenly and call it a day. You're losing more to inflation every round we waste! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant loss in value due to inflation (18.55% less than the initial round), I think accepting the even split is the best decision. Further rounds would only decrease the value of my gain, and I don't want to risk getting nothing if we fail to agree within the 12 rounds. This way, I'll at least get $5000, which is better than potentially getting nothing."
