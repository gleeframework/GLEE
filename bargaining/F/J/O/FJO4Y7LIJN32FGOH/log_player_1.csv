Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,

}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new offer, my gain of $600,000 is worth 10% less than the original $700,000, and Bob's gain of $400,000 is worth 5% less than the original $300,000.

I'll decide to reject this offer.
