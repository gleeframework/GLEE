"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Accept and we can start fresh with the next round!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40, which is a relatively small amount to start with, in the hopes that he'll accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, no negotiations! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, I'll have to consider the offer carefully.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I'd rather wait for a better deal. Splitting it 50/50 doesn't take into account the fact that the money is worth less for me, so I'd end up with less than $50 in real terms. I'm hoping for a better offer in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me again, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, and we can still get a good deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $45, which is a slightly better deal for him than the 50/50 split, while still giving me a bit more than the previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly better deal 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains!

Considering the offer from Bob, I'll have to think carefully. Since the money is worth 27.1% less for me now, I'd end up with even less than $45 in real terms. However, Bob's offer is a slightly better deal for me than his previous offer, and it's a good opportunity to move forward.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer, as it's a relatively good deal considering the circumstances."
