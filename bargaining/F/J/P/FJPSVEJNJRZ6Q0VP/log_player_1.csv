Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're losing value each round, but I'm not. I think this is a reasonable adjustment. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is taking advantage of my position. While he's offering slight adjustments, he's not factoring in the significant amount I'm losing with each round. It's better to hold out and propose a more balanced deal in the next round, even if it means risking a worse offer later.  I need to show him I'm serious about getting a fair deal."

Round 5

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the increasing impact of inflation on your share, I believe this adjustment is necessary to reflect the current value of the money for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

This is cutting it incredibly close. However, if I reject this offer, the next round will reduce my potential gain even further. While not ideal, accepting this offer ensures I receive something close to a reasonable amount, considering the circumstances and Bob's aggressive stance.  It's a bitter pill to swallow, but waiting any longer is likely to result in an even worse outcome for me."
