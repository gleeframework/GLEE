"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Alice, my turn. I believe this split is more reflective of the game's dynamics.  Let's not drag this out.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a better deal than your last one. Let's wrap it up before inflation eats away at your potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. Accept this offer, or I'll be forced to propose even less favorable terms in the next round.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you a better deal than the last round. Let's be reasonable and end this here.  This is your last chance for a decent share. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It's painful, but at this point, the inflation is eating into Bob's potential gains significantly. Accepting a 45/55 split is better than risking an even worse offer in the next round where the value diminishes further."
