Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can be more fair. This offer is closer to an even split. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. The money is losing value fast, and this is the best option for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 
 
Even though I would prefer a slightly larger share, the money is losing value quickly. Accepting a 50/50 split now is the safest option to ensure we both get a reasonable amount.  It's better than risking getting nothing if we can't agree in later rounds."
