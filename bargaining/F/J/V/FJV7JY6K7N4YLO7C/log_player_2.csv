Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.

# Alice's message: We're running out of time, let's compromise. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to a more even split, time is working in my favor.  Her losses to inflation are significant each round, making her need to make a deal more urgent. I'm willing to push my luck a bit further to try and secure a better deal."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""This is my final offer, Alice. Take it or leave it.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Time pressure is mounting for both of us, but especially for Alice.  By taking a firm stance with a ""final offer,"" I'm hoping to push her to accept a less favorable deal to avoid walking away with nothing."
