400000.0,600000.0,"I think we can both do better than a 50/50 split.  Inflation is going to hurt us both, and this way we can still get a decent chunk of the money while it's still worth something.",Bob,2,

450000.0,550000.0,I'm willing to compromise.  Let's split the difference from my last offer and try to get this done before the inflation eats away any more of our money.,Bob,4,
