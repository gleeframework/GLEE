Let's see if we can get a better deal!"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think we can find a more equitable split. I propose 55/45 in my favor, as I'm taking on the risk of this offer being rejected.""}

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation and previous offers, I propose a 55/45 split in favor of Bob. This acknowledges the risk and previous rejection. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would love to see a 60/40 split, the risk of getting nothing is too high. Let's take the deal!"
