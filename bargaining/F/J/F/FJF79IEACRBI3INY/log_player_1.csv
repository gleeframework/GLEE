"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```
I'm offering you $20, and I'll take $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less, I'll have to consider that in my decision.

I'll accept Bob's offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```
I'll take $50 and Bob will take $50."
