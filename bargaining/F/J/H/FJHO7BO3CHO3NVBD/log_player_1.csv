"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my first offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```
I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less now, the actual amounts I would gain are:

* 500,000 / 0.8 = 625,000
* 500,000 / 0.8 = 625,000

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, as it's still a 50-50 split, but the value of the money is less. I'll reject it and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my next offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```
I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which is a bit more favorable to me, but still a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts I would gain in this round:

* 520,000 / 0.516 (1 - 0.484) = 1,008,163.46 (approximately)
* 480,000 / 0.516 = 929,708.16 (approximately)

These amounts are actually more than my original proposal in round 1, but less than my original proposal in round 3. I'll accept this offer.
