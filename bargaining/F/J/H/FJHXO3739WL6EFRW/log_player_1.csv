I'm going to offer a pretty lopsided deal in my favor.  I figure I can get away with it since I have the first offer.  I'll give Bob a small amount to encourage him to accept, but hopefully he'll think he can get more if he rejects.  Let's see how this plays out!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much fairer than my first offer, but I'm going to reject it.  I'm still convinced that I can do better by taking the next round.  The inflation is making things tougher, but I think I can still get a bigger share if I make a counter-offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with a slightly better deal for myself.  The inflation is biting, but I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a compromise and accept.  If not, I'm going to have to get creative with my next offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting more favorable to him with each round, it's still not enough for me to accept. I'm going to keep rejecting and see if I can squeeze out a better deal for myself.  The inflation is making this game tougher, but I'm not giving up yet."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm going to offer a 50/50 split.  I'm feeling the pressure from inflation, and I think Bob is starting to realize that he can't get too greedy.  This is the fairest offer I can make, and I'm hoping that Bob will see it as a good compromise.  Let's see if this finally works!"
