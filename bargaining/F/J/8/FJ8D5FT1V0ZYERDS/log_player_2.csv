"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I think this is a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's tempting to start fair, but remember the inflation rate!  I want to see if I can get a better deal, since I'm losing value faster."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I understand you want a fair split, but the inflation rates are different for us. I'm offering you a bit less, but it's still a good deal considering the shrinking value of our money."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable and split it evenly.  Inflation is hurting us both, so we need to find a compromise. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd love to get more, the inflation is taking a big toll.  A 50/50 split is a reasonable compromise given the circumstances."
