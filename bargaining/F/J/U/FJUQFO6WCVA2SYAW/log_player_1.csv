"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, fair and square?""
}
```

I'm proposing that we split the $100 60/40 in my favor, which means I'd get $60 and Bob would get $40. The message is a friendly one, inviting Bob to accept the offer and end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, since I'm taking a bigger hit on the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to negotiate a better deal for himself, considering the impact of inflation.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to give up 60. I think 55/45 is a more reasonable split, considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and making a counter-proposal, suggesting a 55/45 split in my favor."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is taking its toll! The money is worth even less now. Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 52.5,
  ""bob_gain"": 47.5,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least 52.5 to make it worth my while.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 52.5/47.5 split, taking into account the reduced value of the money due to inflation."
