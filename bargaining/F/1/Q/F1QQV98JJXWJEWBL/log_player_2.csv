# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm still aiming for a better deal, but I appreciate Alice's willingness to negotiate. Let's see what happens next!"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try a 50/50 split, Bob. It's only fair! 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While a 50/50 split isn't ideal, the inflation is really starting to hurt.  It's better to take this offer and ensure we get something than risk getting nothing at all."
