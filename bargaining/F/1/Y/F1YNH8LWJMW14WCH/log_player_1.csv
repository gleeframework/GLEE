"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 20% of the initial amount. You can do better or worse in the next round.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, the value of my gain is 9% of the original amount, which is $9.

I'm not thrilled about the 50-50 split, but I'll consider it. Since the inflation effect on Bob's gain is less severe than mine, I'm inclined to accept this offer to avoid further negotiations.
