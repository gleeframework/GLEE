Round 5

**Reasoning:**

Alice is stubbornly sticking close to her original offer, even though the value of the money is decreasing.  I'm betting she'll become more reasonable as we get closer to the deadline and the risk of getting nothing increases."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and we both lose if this goes on.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to go for a strong play. A 50/50 split is perfectly fair and emphasizes the risk of continued delay.  It also puts the ball firmly in Alice's court - does she value spite more than a guaranteed (and shrinking) sum of money?"
