"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's share fairly 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While it's a fair offer, I'm going to reject. The money is worth less with each round, so it's better to try to get a better deal in the next round, when I get to make the offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""This time I'm going to propose a slightly more favorable deal for myself, but I hope you'll still accept it. It's still a decent amount of money for both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
While I'd prefer to get a bit more, inflation is starting to hurt and this is a decent offer. It's better than what I'd get if we keep going."
