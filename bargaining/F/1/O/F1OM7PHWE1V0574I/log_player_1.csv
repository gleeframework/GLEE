"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. The message is a friendly one, inviting him to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair split, but I want a slightly bigger share 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less, the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: $5,000 * 0.95 = $4,750
Bob gain: $5,000 * 0.95 = $4,750

I'll accept this offer, as it's a fair split and we're making progress.
