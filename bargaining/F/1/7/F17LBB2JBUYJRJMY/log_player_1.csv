Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle, Alice. That way we both get a fair share, even with inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While a 50/50 split seems fair on the surface, the inflation disparity means Bob is getting a better deal over time. I need to push for a better share while the money is still worth something."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6500,
""bob_gain"": 3500,
""message"": ""The longer this goes on, the less we both get, Bob. I'm taking the hit from inflation here, meet me halfway?""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to find a compromise, Alice. I'm willing to give you a bit more to avoid further losses from inflation. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is the same offer I made in Round 1, and while it's not ideal after three rounds of inflation, it's better than risking further losses with a rejection.  The longer this goes on, the less favorable the outcome will be for me.  It's time to cut my losses and accept."
