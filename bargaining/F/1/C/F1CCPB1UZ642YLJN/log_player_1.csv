"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $20, which is 20% of the original amount, and keeping $80 for myself, which is 80% of the original amount. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more balanced split is fair. Let's be reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 16% of the original amount ($80 x 0.8 = $64).

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with Bob's offer, as it seems quite one-sided in his favor. I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With another round of inflation, my gain is now worth 12.8% of the original amount ($64 x 0.8 = $51.20).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 30,
  ""bob_gain"": 70,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $70, which is 70% of the original amount, and keeping $30 for myself, which is 30% of the original amount."
