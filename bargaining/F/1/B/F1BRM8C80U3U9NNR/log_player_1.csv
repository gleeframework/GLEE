"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to find a more balanced split 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the $500,000 I would gain in this round is worth 95% of what I would have gained in the first round, so it's a bit less valuable than my original proposal.

However, I think Bob's proposal is a good one, and a 50-50 split is a fair compromise. I'm willing to accept it.

{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
