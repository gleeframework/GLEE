"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, but I'll give you a bit more to start.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split, giving me $8,000 and Bob $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but still a fair deal 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth 5% less for me, $7,000 is equivalent to $6,850 in the original amount, and $3,000 is equivalent to $2,400 in the original amount.

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me. I was hoping for a bit more, considering the initial offer I made was already a 80-20 split. But I don't want to risk going to the next round, as the money will continue to lose value.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the continued inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money.

Since the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, I'll aim for a slightly higher share to compensate for the loss in value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need a fair share too.""
}
```

In this offer, I'm proposing a 75-25 split, giving me $7,500 and Bob $2,500."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not willing to give up too much 
# Alice gain: 7800 
# Bob gain: 2200 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the accelerated inflation, the money is losing value rapidly. To calculate the equivalent value in the original amount, I'll need to account for the 14.26% reduction for me and the 48.8% reduction for Bob.

For me, $7,800 is equivalent to $6,732 in the original amount, and $2,200 is equivalent to $1,144 in the original amount.

While this offer is better than the previous one, I'm not sure if it's good enough, considering the rapid loss of value. However, I don't want to risk going to the next round, as the money will continue to lose value.
