"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Let's see how the game unfolds. While Alice's offer seems enticing now, the value of the money will decrease quickly for her. I'm willing to bet I can get a better deal in the later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""I'm feeling generous! This offer is better for you than it will be next round.""
}
``` 

Let's see if Alice bites. This offer is still slightly in my favor, but the decreasing value of the money for Alice adds pressure for her to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, let's end this before the money is worthless! 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is feeling the pressure, but I can still hold out for a better deal.  She's losing value faster than I am."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""The clock is ticking, Alice.  This is a pretty good deal considering."" 
}
```

I'm pushing my luck a bit here, but the time pressure is working in my favor.  Let's see if Alice cracks."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still want the bigger share 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is as good as it's going to get for me. Accepting now secures me a reasonable amount before inflation eats away at the value further."
