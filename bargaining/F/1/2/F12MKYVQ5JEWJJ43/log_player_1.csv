"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 90, you get 10. Accept and we're done!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 90-10 split, which is a relatively fair starting point. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, I'll take 60 and you get 40. Accept now! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, my gain of 40 is actually 40 * 0.9 = 36 in real value.

I don't think 36 is a bad deal, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll reject this offer for now and try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to see if Bob will accept.

Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, my gain of 70 is actually 70 * 0.9^2 = 58.1 in real value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 58,
  ""bob_gain"": 42,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 42, but I'm taking 58. It's a good deal, accept now!""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will bite!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not giving me enough, I'll take 55 and you get 45. It's a fair compromise! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, my gain of 45 is actually 45 * 0.723 = 32.53 in real value.

I'm not sure if 32.53 is a good deal, but I'm getting a bit desperate since we're running out of rounds. I'll accept this offer.
