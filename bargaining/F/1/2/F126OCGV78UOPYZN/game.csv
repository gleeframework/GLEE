6000.0,4000.0,"Let's start with a simple split, Bob. I get $6,000, you get $4,000. It's a good deal for you in the early rounds.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Your offer was a bit too skewed in your favor, Alice.  How about we meet a bit closer to the middle? This deal gets us both a good chunk of change.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5600.0,4400.0,"Okay, Bob, let's find a middle ground. I'll come down a bit to $5,600, and you get $4,400.  Every round counts with inflation!",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
5200.0,4800.0,"Alice, we're getting close, but we need to factor in the inflation. This offer is fair considering the value decrease.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5300.0,4700.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm adjusting again for inflation, but we're losing money every round!  Take the $4,700 while it's still worth something!",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
4900.0,5100.0,"Alice, I understand the urgency of inflation, but the deal has to be fair. I'm taking on more risk with the longer we wait, so this split is more reflective of that.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Bob, this is insane! We're running out of time.  Let's split this 50/50 and get out of here before inflation eats all our money!",Alice,7,
