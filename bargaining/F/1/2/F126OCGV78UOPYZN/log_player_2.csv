Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's find a middle ground. I'll come down a bit to $5,600, and you get $4,400.  Every round counts with inflation! 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm adjusting again for inflation, but we're losing money every round!  Take the $4,700 while it's still worth something! 
# Bob gain: 4700 
# Alice gain: 5300 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is right about the impact of inflation, she's still getting the better end of the deal. I need to push for a more significant shift in my favor before we run out of rounds."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5100, ""alice_gain"": 4900, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand the urgency of inflation, but the deal has to be fair. I'm taking on more risk with the longer we wait, so this split is more reflective of that.""}

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is insane! We're running out of time.  Let's split this 50/50 and get out of here before inflation eats all our money! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is finally agreeing to a fair split. While I might have been able to squeeze out a tiny bit more in earlier rounds, the inflation is working strongly against us now. Accepting a 50/50 split at this point ensures we both walk away with something instead of risking getting nothing at all."
