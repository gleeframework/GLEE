"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I'll take most of the money this round, but I'm open to a more even split in the future. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is tempting in the short term, rejecting and going to the next round makes more sense.  By rejecting, Bob can force Alice to make a more equitable offer in the future. He'll also gain leverage as the value of the money decreases for him with each passing round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split the money evenly. This is a better deal for both of us in the long run.""}
