"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

I propose taking $9,000 and leaving $1,000 for Bob. This is a fair starting point, and I hope Bob will accept.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

Bob's offer:

# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}

I propose a compromise.  Let's split the money 8000 for me and 2000 for Bob.  I'm willing to give up some of my initial gain to reach a solution that's more equitable."

# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is still a very lopsided offer. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept such a drastic difference in the division. Let's try to find a more balanced agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm making another concession, offering $7000 to me and $3000 to Bob. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair proposal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement this time."

# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm lowering my offer to $6000 for me and $4000 for Bob. This is a big compromise, but I'm hoping we can finally come to an agreement.  We're running out of time!"
