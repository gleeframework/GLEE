"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, considering the inflation! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is ""fair"" in terms of the initial split, it's not considering the inflation impact.  Bob stands to lose a lot more with each passing round due to the higher inflation rate.  Let's see if we can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm taking a risk here, but with the inflation hitting us harder, I need a larger share to make this worthwhile. Let's work together and avoid losing everything!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my offer is more generous than before. Don't risk losing everything! 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Alice's message might sound tempting, her offer is still heavily weighted towards her. Even with the inflation, I can still do better by continuing to negotiate.  Let's see if we can get a more balanced split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. We both need to agree on a split that benefits both of us.  This offer is fair given the inflation, and we can still both walk away with a significant amount of money.  What do you say?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're running out of time! Inflation is eating away our gains. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is still not reflecting the reality of our situation.  While the time is running out, my loss due to inflation is much greater than hers.  I need to push for a larger share to make this worthwhile."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Alice, we're both losing money with each passing round. We need to come to an agreement quickly.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need a share that reflects my greater losses due to inflation. Let's settle on this offer to avoid ending up with nothing.""}
