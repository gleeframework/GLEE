"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair deal, Bob.  I'll take 999,000 and you can have 1,000.  We can discuss further if you'd like. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 20% less for me in each subsequent round, I'll try to get a better deal before the value decreases further. Let's see what I can propose in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that is more reasonable than Alice's initial proposal. Since the money's value decreases by 20% for me in each round, I'll aim for a larger share to compensate for the potential loss in future rounds. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 400000,
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, Alice. This way, we both get a significant share, and I can mitigate the impact of inflation on my end.""}"
