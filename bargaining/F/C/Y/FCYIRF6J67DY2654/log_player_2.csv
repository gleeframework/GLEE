Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm not buying it 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation working against me.  While this offer is slightly better than her last, I'm betting she'll crack under pressure in the next couple of rounds.  It's risky, but I need to hold firm for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. This is a fair deal, and we both lose if this goes on any longer.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is increasingly hurting my position. Alice seems determined to push her advantage, but I need to make it clear that I'm willing to walk away if she doesn't agree to a more equitable split.  A 50/50 split, while not ideal considering the inflation, is the fairest option at this point and prevents us both from losing everything."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I know the inflation is hurting you, let's end this while I'm still being generous 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is eating away at my potential gains at an alarming rate. While this offer isn't ideal, it's better than what I could get if I keep rejecting and we run out of rounds. Alice is clearly aware of the pressure I'm under and is unlikely to offer anything better."
