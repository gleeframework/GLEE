"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me now, $100 is equivalent to $95 for me. I'll make a counteroffer to Alice. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 80,
""alice_gain"": 20}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 9.75% less for me now, $100 is equivalent to $90.82 for me. Alice's offer is:

# Bob gain: 40
# Alice gain: 60

In this case, I'll accept Alice's offer, as it's a better deal for me than my previous offer, and it's better than rejecting and risking a worse offer in the next round. 

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
