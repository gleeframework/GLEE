"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. I'll take 60, you take 40. No need for haggling.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal. You can have 45, and I'll take 55. It's a good compromise. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to be more cautious. Bob's offer is still a bit too skewed towards him, but it's a better deal than my initial offer. I'll consider it, but I'd like to negotiate a bit more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 45-55, I'll try to counter with a 50-50 split. This way, I'm not giving him a better deal than my initial 60-40, but I'm also not getting a better deal than his 45-55.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, Bob. 50-50 seems fair to me.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal. You can have 42, and I'll take 58. It's a good compromise. 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth even less now, so I need to be even more careful. Bob's offer is still not very favorable to me, but it's a slightly better deal than his previous one. I'll consider it, but I'd like to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 42-58, I'll try to counter with a 48-52 split. This way, I'm getting a slightly better deal than his previous offer, and I'm not giving him a better deal than my previous 50-50 offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 48,
  ""bob_gain"": 52,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more. 48-52 seems fair to me.""
}
