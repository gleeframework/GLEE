Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 425000 
# Alice gain: 575000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, accepting is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:** With each round, Bob's potential gains decrease significantly due to inflation. Waiting any longer will only result in a worse deal for him.
* **Alice's Unlikely Shift:** Alice has consistently aimed for a larger share and is unlikely to suddenly offer a significantly better deal for Bob.
* **Something is Better than Nothing:** While $425,000 is far from an ideal split for Bob, it's better than reaching a point where inflation makes even lower offers more appealing to Alice. 

Delaying further significantly risks Bob's position, making accepting the current offer the most pragmatic choice."
