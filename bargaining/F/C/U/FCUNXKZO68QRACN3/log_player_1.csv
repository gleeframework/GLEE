"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

I'm going to start with a very lopsided offer. I figure Bob is likely to reject this, but it sets a clear precedent for who's in control and how much I'm willing to give up.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

A fair split is a good outcome for me.  Let's end this now!"
