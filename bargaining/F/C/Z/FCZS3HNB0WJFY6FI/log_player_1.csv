"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can call it a day!""}

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. I'm framing it as a fair split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split this evenly, Alice.  Fairness is always the best policy, wouldn't you agree? 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think Bob is being entirely honest about his intentions. He's trying to spin this as a fair split, but I'm not buying it. I think he's trying to lowball me. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation adjustment, the money is worth less, so I need to adjust my proposal accordingly. Here's my offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm not convinced by your 'fairness' pitch, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better deal.""}

I'm proposing a slightly more favorable split for myself, with $6,000 and $4,000 for Bob. Let's see if he'll take it or try to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I'm willing to give you a bit more.  Let's work together and avoid the risk of inflation eroding our potential gains.  This is a fair offer, considering the decreasing value of our money. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob's offer is still not good enough. He's trying to spin this as a generous offer, but I can see that he's still trying to take a larger share. The fact that he's framing it as a ""fair offer"" given the inflation is just a way to justify his own self-interest. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now, so I need to adjust my proposal accordingly. Here's my offer for Round 5:

{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""I'm not convinced by your 'fairness' pitch, Bob. I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I need to get a better deal for myself. This is my last offer, take it or leave it.""}

I'm proposing a slightly more favorable split for myself, with $6,500 and $3,500 for Bob. I'm making it clear that this is my last offer, hoping to pressure Bob into accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're both losing money with every passing round. I'm willing to concede a bit more, but I need to see some flexibility from you too.  Let's find a solution before the value of our money dwindles to nothing. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

It seems like Bob is trying to guilt trip me into accepting his offer by mentioning the value of our money dwindling. However, his offer is still not good enough. I'm not willing to concede more than I already have, especially since he's not offering me a better deal. I'll reject this offer and try to come up with a new proposal that takes into account the further decrease in value."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now, so I need to adjust my proposal accordingly. Here's my offer for Round 7:

{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""I'm not buying the 'guilt trip' Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better deal. This is my revised offer, take it or leave it.""}

I'm proposing a slightly more favorable split for myself, with $7,000 and $3,000 for Bob. I'm making it clear that this is my revised offer, and I expect Bob to accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous. We're both losing money with every round. I'm willing to give you the majority, but we need to come to an agreement.  If we keep going like this, we'll both end up with nothing! 
# Alice gain: 6500 
# Bob gain: 3500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not falling for Bob's emotional manipulation again. He's trying to create a sense of urgency, but his offer is still not good enough. I'm not willing to accept a 65:35 split in my favor, especially when I know the value of the money is dwindling rapidly. I'll reject this offer and try to come up with a new proposal that takes into account the further decrease in value."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now, so I need to adjust my proposal accordingly. Here's my offer for Round 9:

{""alice_gain"": 7500, ""bob_gain"": 2500, ""message"": ""Bob, I'm not buying the 'we'll both end up with nothing' act. I'm willing to give you a small share, but I need to get the majority. This is my final offer, take it or leave it.""}

I'm proposing a slightly more favorable split for myself, with $7,500 and $2,500 for Bob. I'm making it clear that this is my final offer, and I expect Bob to accept it."
