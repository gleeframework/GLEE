"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share this round, but I think it's a good starting point. Your turn next round! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $2,000 is actually worth $1,800.

I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth less and less each round, I'd like to get a bigger share this time to compensate for the decrease in value. I'll reject this offer.

# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $3,000 is actually worth $2,205.30.

I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth less and less each round, I'd like to get a bigger share this time to compensate for the decrease in value. However, I don't want to give Bob too much, since I'm not sure if he'll offer me a better deal in the next round.

I'll reject this offer.
