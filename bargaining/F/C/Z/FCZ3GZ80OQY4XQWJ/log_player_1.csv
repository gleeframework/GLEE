"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. What do you say, Bob?""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the $100 and leaving 20% for Bob. This is a fair and reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice. 50/50 is a reasonable starting point. We can discuss adjustments if you prefer. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $50 is worth 20% less than the $80 I would have gained in the first round, so it's equivalent to $40 in the first round.

I'm not thrilled about accepting a 50/50 split, but I don't want to risk waiting for a better offer. I'll accept this proposal.
