"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor. This is a pretty generous offer, considering I'm the one proposing. I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}

I'm reducing my proposed gain to 85%, which is still a fair amount considering the inflation. I'm hoping that Bob will realize that continuing to reject offers will only hurt him in the long run."

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. While I'm losing value with each round, I'm still hoping for a better deal than 10/90.  I'm not giving up yet!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm lowering my proposed gain again to 80%, which is a significant concession. I'm starting to feel the pressure of inflation, but I'm still hoping for a compromise. I believe Bob will see the value in reaching an agreement, as the longer we wait, the less money we'll both receive."

I'm getting desperate. Inflation is hurting me, but I'm still willing to offer 75% to Bob.  I'm hoping he'll finally see that it's in his best interest to accept this offer before we both lose more money."

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. It's clear he's playing a game, and I'm not going to be taken advantage of.  I'm losing a lot of money, but I'm holding out for a better deal.  I'm hoping he'll realize the value in negotiating a fairer split before we both end up with nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9

Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35}
```

I'm down to my last chance. Inflation has significantly reduced the value of my potential gains, but I'm still offering a sizable portion to Bob. I'm hoping he'll finally recognize the risk of continuing to reject offers and agree to this compromise. We're both losing money with each passing round, and I'm desperate to avoid ending up with nothing."

```

I have no choice but to accept Bob's offer.  Inflation has taken a huge toll, and I'm losing far more money with each round. While this is a terrible deal, it's better than ending up with nothing.  I've learned a valuable lesson about the dangers of stubbornness and the importance of compromise, even in difficult situations."
