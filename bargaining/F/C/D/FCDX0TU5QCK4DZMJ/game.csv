45.0,55.0,"I think a 55/45 split is fairer. It's closer to even, but still gives you a slight advantage. Let's finish this and get the money.",Bob,2,

55.0,45.0,"Bob, I understand you want a more even split. How about we meet in the middle at 55/45? It's closer to my initial offer but still gives you a larger share than your proposal.  Let's settle this before inflation eats away at our gains.",Alice,3,
