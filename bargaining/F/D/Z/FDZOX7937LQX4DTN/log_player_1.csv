"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 3:1, I'll take the smaller share if you agree""
}
```

I'm proposing a 3:1 split in my favor, but I'm willing to take the smaller share to get the game started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I want a bigger one for myself 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than a 2:3 split. I'll wait for the next round to make a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, I'll give you a slightly smaller share""
}
```

I'm trying to find a more balanced split, and I think 55:45 is a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a tiny share, but I'll take most of the money 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than a 1:7 split. The money is worth less and less with each round, so I need to be more aggressive in my proposals. I'll wait for the next round to make a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
 ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to haggle""
}
```

I'm going for a 50/50 split this time, trying to find a more equitable solution."
