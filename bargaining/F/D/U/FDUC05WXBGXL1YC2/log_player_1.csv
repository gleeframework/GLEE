Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor.  Consider the depreciation - it hurts you more than me to wait. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
