"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This is a classic bargaining scenario. Since I'm playing as Alice, I want to get as much of the money as possible. This offer essentially gives Bob a tiny portion while maximizing Alice's share. It's highly unlikely Bob will accept, but it sets the stage for future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer to get more, the inflation factor makes this a good deal. My gain is worth 5% less than the initial round, so accepting this offer is the best strategy to maximize my take home, considering the risk of getting a worse offer in the next round."
