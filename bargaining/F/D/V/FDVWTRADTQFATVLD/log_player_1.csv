"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, it's a good starting point""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the total amount, which is $6,000, and Bob gets 40%, which is $4,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and we can adjust as needed in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, it's a fair starting point 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the reduced value of my potential gain due to inflation, but I'll consider Bob's offer.

I think meeting in the middle is a reasonable approach, and Bob's proposal is a decent one. I'll accept his offer for now.
