Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is stubbornly sticking close to her original offer, while I'm losing money due to inflation each round. It's time to show I'm serious about getting a better deal, even if it means risking a few more rounds.  I'll hold out for a larger increase from her in the next round."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 510000,
""alice_gain"": 490000,
""message"": ""This is getting ridiculous.  Accept this offer, or I'm aiming for a much larger share in the next round.  The clock is ticking, and we both lose if this falls through.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Resolve:** By slightly increasing my demand from the even split, I am demonstrating that I'm serious about getting a better deal and that her stalling tactics aren't working.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  The message emphasizes the time pressure and the fact that we both lose if we don't reach an agreement. This might push Alice to be more agreeable.
* **Strategic Retreat (Slight):** While my demand increased, it's still a relatively small shift from the 50/50 split, signaling that I'm willing to negotiate but not to be walked over."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting desperate, I can see. But I'm still not budging much 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough call, but the risk of losing everything is becoming too high. Here's why it's time to accept, even though it's not ideal:

* **Diminishing Returns:** The inflation is eating significantly into my potential gains. Each round I reject an offer, the value I lose increases.
* **Alice's Stubbornness:** It's clear Alice is comfortable dragging this out and unlikely to drastically change her offer. Holding out for much more might result in a worse outcome if she keeps increasing her share at this slow pace. 
* **Something is Better than Nothing:**  While 440,000 is much less than I aimed for, it's still a significant amount of money. Getting zero after holding out for a slightly better deal would be a devastating loss."
