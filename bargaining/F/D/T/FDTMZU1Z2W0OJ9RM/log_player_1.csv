Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out, Alice. This is my final offer, let's close the deal and avoid losing more to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** With each round, the value of the money decreases significantly due to inflation.  We're already at round 4 out of 12, and further delays hurt both of us.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better outcome for me, especially considering Bob seems to be pushing for a larger share.
* **Certainty:** Accepting now guarantees a payout, even if it's slightly less than I hoped for initially. Rejecting this offer risks walking away with nothing if we can't reach an agreement in the remaining rounds. 

While I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, accepting now cuts my losses and ensures I get something out of this deal."
