"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, Bob. I take a bit more considering the money loses value for me with each round. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. Since the money loses 20% of its value for Alice each round, I might be able to get a better deal later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a fair offer. The money is worth the same to me, but it's losing value for you, so I took a bit more.""}\n\n###\n\nI'm trying to take advantage of the fact that the money loses value for Alice each round, so I'm making a slightly more aggressive offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm taking a significant loss with each round, and you're just trying to take advantage. My last offer is a 55/45 split in my favor.  Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering Alice's message, it seems like she's getting frustrated and is less likely to make a better offer in the future. Additionally, the money is still worth the same to me, but it's losing value rapidly for Alice. I think accepting this offer is the best decision, as I might not get a better deal in the next rounds."
