"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $100,000. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount, hoping that he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest solution, and we can both get a good amount. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 10% less, so the $500,000 I would get is actually worth $450,000 to me.

I'm not sure if this is the fairest solution, but it's a significant amount, and I don't want to risk going to the next round and losing more value due to inflation.

I'll accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
