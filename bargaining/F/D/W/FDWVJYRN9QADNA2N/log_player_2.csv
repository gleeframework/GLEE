"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take the bigger share but you still get a good portion. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

 While this offer seems tempting at first, it's important to remember the inflation factor.  Rejecting allows me to make a counter-offer and potentially get a larger share, as the money Alice gains will be worth less in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I think this is a fair split, considering the inflation factor. Let's end this game and get our money."" 
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time, considering the inflation. No need to keep playing this game. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
