"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 20% of the total.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial $10,000, which is $2,000, and keeping the remaining $8,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle, a fair and simple solution. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation has already taken a bite out of my potential gains.

Considering Bob's proposal, I'll decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure if splitting it down the middle is truly fair, considering the initial proposal I made was a 80:20 split. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation taking a 20% toll on my potential gains, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm still the one taking on the risk of negotiating.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share, hoping to get a better deal before the next round of inflation hits."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll now. My potential gains are dwindling rapidly.

Considering Bob's proposal, I'll decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that this is a fair compromise, especially considering my initial offer was a 80:20 split. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round, but I'm starting to get worried that I'll be left with a tiny fraction of the original amount."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation taking a significant bite out of my potential gains, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a smaller share, but I'm not going to let you get the better deal. It's now or never!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share, but I'm trying to squeeze as much as I can out of the remaining amount. It's getting desperate, and I'm not sure how much more I can afford to give away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going to settle for a bad deal, I'm going to take a chance and try to get a better share. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really crippling my potential gains now. I'm starting to lose hope.

Considering Bob's proposal, I'll decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I don't have much choice at this point. The value of my potential gains is dwindling rapidly, and I'm not sure I can afford to reject this offer. I'll take the $2,000 and hope it's enough to make it worth my while."
