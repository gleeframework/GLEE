"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can shake on it.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. The message is a friendly invitation to accept the offer and end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You offered 60/40, I'm offering 70/30. Accept and we can finish this. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

Considering the new offer, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of 70/30, as I think I can do better than that. I'll wait for the next round to make a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Time to make a new offer!

Considering the inflation, my offer is now worth 5% less than the previous round, so I'll aim for a better split.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000,
  ""message"": ""You went from 60/40 to 70/30, I'll meet you halfway at 55/45. Accept and we can finish this.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $460,000 and keeping $540,000 for myself. The message is a counter-proposal to meet him halfway between his 70/30 and the original 60/40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You met me at 55/45, I'll go back to 60/40. Accept and we can finish this. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my gains!

Considering the new offer, I'll have to weigh the benefits of accepting a 60/40 split against the possibility of waiting for a better offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer of 60/40, as the inflation is making my gains decrease rapidly, and this is a relatively fair split considering the circumstances. I'll take the $400,000 and call it a day."
