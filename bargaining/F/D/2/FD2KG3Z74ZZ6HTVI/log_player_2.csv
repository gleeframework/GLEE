""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer was too lopsided. Let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a 65/35 split in my favor.  This accounts for the fact that the value of the money decreases faster for me with each round.""}

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to concede some of my share, but I'm still the one bearing more of the loss from inflation.  60/40 feels like a fair compromise. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000
