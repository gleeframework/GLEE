Round 5

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly aiming to take the majority of the money and is relying on my fear of inflation to wear me down. However, even with the increasing inflation, accepting an offer below 50% in round 5 is too much of a loss.  I'm betting she'll start getting nervous soon and propose a more reasonable offer."
