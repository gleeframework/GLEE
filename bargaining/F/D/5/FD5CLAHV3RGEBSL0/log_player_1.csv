"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject my offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but still willing to compromise! 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not a bad offer, but I'm still looking for a more even split.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but 75% is a bit steep. Let's meet in the middle!""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will be willing to compromise further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Let's find a sweet spot, Bob! This way, we both get a good chunk.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance that works for both of us. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject my offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give a bit more to you, but I'm still looking for a better deal! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money losing value due to inflation, I'm getting a bit more cautious. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's still a bit too skewed towards your favor, Bob. I'm willing to give you a bit more, but 80% is too much. Let's meet in the middle!""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will be willing to compromise further and give me a fairer share."
