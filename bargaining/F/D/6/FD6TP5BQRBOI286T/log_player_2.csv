Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation rate, I propose we divide the money in such a way that you receive less than your share in previous rounds. This might seem fair given the decreasing value of our currency.

# Alice gain: 81 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
