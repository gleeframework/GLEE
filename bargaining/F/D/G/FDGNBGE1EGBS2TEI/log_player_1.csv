"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take the majority, but you'll get a decent chunk.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 80% of the initial $10,000, and Bob will get 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split, considering the inflation we need to account for.  Let's be reasonable and end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the $4500 I would gain in this round is actually worth $4050 in the previous round's money.

I'm not convinced by Bob's offer. I think I can do better than this. I'll reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more due to my initial proposal. This is my best offer.""
}
```

I'm trying to be more generous, but I'm still aiming to get a slight majority of the money."
