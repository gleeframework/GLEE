"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

This way, I get 80% of the original amount, and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll consider the effective gains in terms of the original amount.

For me, the effective gain is 600,000 / 0.9 = 666,667 (original amount)
For Bob, the effective gain is 400,000 / 0.8 = 500,000 (original amount)

I'll accept Bob's offer.
