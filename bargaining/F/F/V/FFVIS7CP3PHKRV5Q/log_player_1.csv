"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a clean slate!""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting 60 dollars and Bob getting 40 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle and start with a fair split 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

I'm not sure if meeting in the middle is the best strategy, considering the inflation rate. However, I do want to make some progress and avoid getting nothing.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
