"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $60 and Bob getting $40. My message to Bob is that I think this is a fair starting point for the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $40 is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to $36 in the first round's value.

I'm not thrilled with the 40-60 split, but I'll consider it. Since I was initially looking for a 60-40 split, I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept Bob's offer.
