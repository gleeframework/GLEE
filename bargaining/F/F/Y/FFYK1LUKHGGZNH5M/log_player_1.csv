"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept and we can split the money fairly. If you reject, I'll make a better offer next round.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. The message is a gentle nudge to accept the offer and avoid further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money evenly. It's the fairest way to divide it, and we can both walk away happy. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'm not as eager to give up as much as I was in the first round. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm willing to split it evenly. I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money.""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer, taking into account the reduced value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. This offer is a good balance between giving you a decent share and keeping a significant amount for myself.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, which is still a significant amount, but I'm keeping $700,000 for myself to account for the decreasing value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share this time, but it's still a fair offer.  Let's end this before we both lose money. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the increased inflation, the money is becoming less valuable by the minute. Considering my reduced gain, I'll think carefully about this offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to accept such a small share. I need a better offer to make it worth my while.""
}
```

I'm not convinced that this offer is good enough, especially considering the reduced value of the money. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is becoming increasingly worthless! With the reduced value of the money, I'll make a new offer that's even more aggressive. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, but I still think I deserve a larger share. This is my best offer so far.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a smaller share than before, but I'm keeping $600,000 for myself to try to maximize my gain."
