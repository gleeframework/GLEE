Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try a 50/50 split this time. I'm willing to compromise to avoid further rounds of negotiation and the effects of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

A 50/50 split is a fair outcome considering the effects of inflation.  Let's move on."
