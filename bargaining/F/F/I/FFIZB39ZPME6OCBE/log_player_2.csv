Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

``` 

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer of a 57-43 split in round 5 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:** The value of Bob's potential gain is decreasing significantly with each round.  Waiting any longer will only result in a worse deal for him.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Bob's attempts to negotiate a more favorable split have been unsuccessful. It's unlikely Alice will move much further from her position. 
* **Guaranteed Return:** Accepting the current offer guarantees Bob a significant sum of money. Holding out for a slightly better split in later rounds carries a high risk of ending up with even less. 

While accepting a 43% share isn't ideal, it's the most rational decision considering the circumstances and the impact of inflation on Bob's potential earnings.
