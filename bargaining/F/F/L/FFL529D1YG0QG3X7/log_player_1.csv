"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but it's a generous offer considering we have 12 rounds to negotiate. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can split the money quickly!"

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Considering the inflation, my potential gain of 4000$ is actually worth 3600$ in real value (80% of 4000$). Bob's gain of 6000$ is worth 5400$ in real value (90% of 6000$).

It's a decent offer, but I'm not sure if I want to settle for a smaller share. I'll reject it and try to negotiate further.
