Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  Let's finish quickly, time is money!""
}
``` 

This offer is designed to be enticing enough for Bob to accept, knowing that the value of the money decreases over time, but also gives me a significant advantage.  I'm hoping Bob is risk-averse and will prefer to settle now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split in my favor is fairer, considering the inflation will hurt you more than me. Let's settle this now. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is trying to exploit the situation and take advantage of the faster inflation impacting me. While a 60/40 split in his favor might seem appealing considering the decreasing value, I need to hold out for a better deal.  I'm willing to gamble that he'll be more open to compromise as the game progresses and the value of the money continues to shrink."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but a 50/50 split isn't fair with the inflation rates.  How about 55/45?  We should settle before this money loses too much value.""
}
``` 

This offer represents a compromise, acknowledging the impact of inflation without completely giving in to Bob's demands. It's still a favorable split for me while being closer to the middle ground, hopefully encouraging Bob to accept before the value drops further."
