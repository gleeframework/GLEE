```

  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly, slightly in my favor""

I'm offering Bob $4,500 and taking $5,500 for myself, with a message hoping to persuade him that this is a reasonable split. Waiting for Bob's response!"

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a slight advantage, how about we switch it up this round? 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer, as I still think I can get a better deal, and I'm not willing to give up the advantage that easily. Let's see what the next round brings!"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 3:

}\n\nI'm trying to compromise and find a middle ground between our previous offers, hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable proposal and accept it. Fingers crossed!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer again, as I still think I can get a slightly better deal, and I'm not willing to give up too much due to inflation. The gap between our offers is narrowing, so I'm hoping we can reach an agreement soon!"

  ""alice_gain"": 5050,
  ""bob_gain"": 4950,
  ""message"": ""Inflation is hitting me harder, let's balance it out""
}\n\nI'm trying to take into account the fact that inflation is affecting me more than Bob, so I'm adjusting my offer to balance out the loss in value. Hopefully, this will be the round where we can reach an agreement!"
