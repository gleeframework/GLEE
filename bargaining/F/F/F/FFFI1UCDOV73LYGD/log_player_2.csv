Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** We are now past the halfway point of the rounds. Accepting a less-than-ideal offer is better than risking getting $0. 
* **Alice's Losses:** Alice is experiencing a much steeper inflation rate. Her willingness to accept slightly less than half indicates she's feeling the pressure. 
* **Minimal Difference:**  The difference between this offer and my previous one is only $150 in Alice's favor after accounting for my lower inflation rate. 

It's a tough decision, but taking the guaranteed money at this point seems like the most logical choice."
