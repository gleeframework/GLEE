Alice's offer:

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Since my money isn't losing value, I'm willing to take a bit more. 65-35 seems reasonable now. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly. Inflation is hitting us hard, and a 50-50 split seems fair considering the circumstances.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to take a bigger share, considering my money isn't losing value and yours is. 70-30 seems like a good compromise. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
At this point, accepting Alice's offer is the best option for Bob. Even though the share is significantly less than in the first round, the continuous devaluation of Bob's money due to inflation makes it impossible to hold out for a better deal. Accepting the offer allows Bob to at least secure some value before it diminishes further."
