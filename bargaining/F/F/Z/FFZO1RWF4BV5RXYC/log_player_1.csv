Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more, since the money is worth less to you in each round.

# Bob gain: 600000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The money is worth even less to you now. I'm taking a bigger share. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While the decreasing value due to inflation is putting pressure on me, accepting this offer would mean a significant loss compared to even a 50/50 split. Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the situation. It's a risk, but I need to push for a better deal."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. I'm willing to accept a slight loss due to the circumstances, but I won't be taken advantage of. This is my final offer. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I need to make a move that balances countering Bob's aggressive strategy while acknowledging the shrinking value of the money due to inflation.  This offer:

* **Shows flexibility:** It concedes that a 50/50 split is likely off the table.
* **Sets a firm boundary:** It makes it clear I won't accept anything significantly less. 
* **Introduces time pressure:** By framing it as a ""final offer,"" I increase the pressure on Bob to settle before inflation erodes the deal further.

It's a gamble, but at this point, standing firm is crucial to avoid getting a drastically reduced share."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm not buying it. The money is worth even less to you now. I'll take an even bigger share. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly trying to exploit the situation and is not negotiating in good faith.  He's calling my bluff, but accepting this offer would be disastrous. I need to hold my ground and make it clear that I'm willing to walk away from the table if he doesn't start negotiating reasonably. The inflation is hurting, but getting a paltry sum is worse than getting nothing and demonstrating my strength in future negotiations."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""message"": ""Bob, it's clear you're not interested in a fair deal. This is my final concession. Accept this, and we'll end this now.  If not, I'm walking away, and we both get nothing. Don't let your greed ruin this opportunity.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time for a bold move. Bob has shown he's willing to push me to the edge. This offer is a calculated risk:

* **Significant Compromise:** It's a substantial drop from my previous offer, acknowledging the pressure of inflation.
* **Ultimatum:**  By framing it as a ""take it or leave it"" scenario with a clear consequence (walking away), I'm forcing Bob to seriously consider the potential losses if he continues his hardball tactics.

He might be tempted to gamble on another round, but the threat of getting zero should make him reconsider.  This strategy is a balance between minimizing further losses from inflation and maximizing the chance of securing a reasonable, albeit reduced, share."
