Alice's offer:

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my offer is still the best on the table.  I'm feeling the inflation pinch, so let's wrap this up!

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  The clock is ticking and we're both losing out.  Meet me in the middle - take it or leave it! 
# Bob gain: 4700 
# Alice gain: 5300

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in Round 5 makes the most sense given the circumstances:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is steadily decreasing for Alice, making her more motivated to settle. However, this doesn't directly impact me.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Holding out for a slightly better offer in later rounds isn't worth the risk of Alice further devaluing the deal. 
* **Certainty:** Accepting now guarantees a reasonable share, whereas continuing the game offers no guaranteed outcome. 

It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $4700."
