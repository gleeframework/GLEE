"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 

I'm going for a high initial offer, aiming to secure a large share of the money before inflation starts to take its toll."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best strategy. Inflation will reduce the value of the money in future rounds, making it less beneficial to keep rejecting offers. A 50/50 split is a fair outcome considering the inflation factor."
