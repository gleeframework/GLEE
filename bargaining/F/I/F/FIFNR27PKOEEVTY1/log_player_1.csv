"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm offering you 40% of the initial $100, which is $40. I'm keeping the remaining 60%, which is $60."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less, I'll have to reassess the offer.

Since the total amount is now $95 (due to inflation), Bob's offer would give me $47.50 and him $47.50.

I'll accept this offer.
