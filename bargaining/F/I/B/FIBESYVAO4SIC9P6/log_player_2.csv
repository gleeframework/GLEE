"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal, Bob. I believe this is a fair starting point for us. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. The current proposal doesn't seem fair to me, and I believe we can find a better division. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that I think is more reasonable. Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Alice in each round, I'll try to find a balance that takes this into account.\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, let's aim for a more balanced split.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out and inflation is eating our potential gains. I'm offering a compromise - let's settle this before it's too late. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer as well. Although Alice is trying to convey a sense of urgency due to inflation, her offer doesn't significantly improve upon the initial proposal. Given the devaluing of money, especially for Alice, I believe there's still room for a more favorable division. Let's continue to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make another offer, taking into account the increased impact of inflation on both our gains. Since Alice is losing more value over time, I'll try to find a balance that might be more appealing to her while still being reasonable for me.\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Inflation is hitting us both, but I'm willing to find a middle ground. Let's settle before it gets worse.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm serious about reaching a deal. This is my final compromise. We need to act before inflation makes this whole thing pointless. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer again. Although Alice claims this is her final compromise, the offer still doesn't significantly shift the balance in my favor, considering the increasing impact of inflation on her gains. With each round, the pressure mounts on Alice due to the higher devaluation of her potential gains. I'll push for another round, aiming for a more substantial concession from her side."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make another offer, considering the significant impact of inflation on Alice's potential gains. Given that her share is now worth nearly 60% less than in the first round, I'll try to find a division that reflects this substantial loss of value while still being somewhat reasonable.\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 62, ""alice_gain"": 38, ""message"": ""Considering the heavy impact of inflation on your share, I'm willing to make a deal, but it needs to reflect the current value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  Inflation is hurting us both.  Meet me in the middle or this will be my last offer. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer. Despite Alice's assertion that this might be her last offer and the call to meet in the middle, the proposed division still doesn't adequately reflect the significantly higher impact of inflation on her share. Her gains are now worth nearly 74% less than in the first round, which puts substantial pressure on her to settle for a less favorable division. I'll push for another round, hoping the mounting pressure due to inflation will prompt a more significant concession from Alice."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make another offer, taking into account the severe impact of inflation on Alice's potential gains. With her share now worth nearly 74% less than in the first round, I'll propose a division that reflects this drastic reduction in value while still leaving some room for negotiation.\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Given the extreme devaluation of your share, I'm willing to make a deal, but it must account for the current value disparity.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 83.22% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is insane.  We are both getting completely fleeced by this inflation.  It's 50/50 or nothing.  Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer. Although Alice frames this as a final, take-it-or-leave-it proposal and highlights the significant impact of inflation on both our gains, accepting a 50/50 split at this point would not be advantageous for me. Given that her share is now worth over 83% less than in the first round, compared to my share being worth about 33.66% less, the real value we're negotiating over is significantly skewed in my favor. I'll push for another round, hoping to capitalize on the extreme devaluation of her potential gains to secure a more favorable division."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make another offer, considering the extremely high impact of inflation on Alice's potential gains. With her share now worth over 83% less than in the first round, I'll propose a division that reflects this drastic reduction in value and aims to maximize my gains, given the significant disparity in the real value we're negotiating over.\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 80, ""alice_gain"": 20, ""message"": ""Given the extreme difference in how inflation has affected our shares, I believe this division is more reflective of the current situation.""}"
