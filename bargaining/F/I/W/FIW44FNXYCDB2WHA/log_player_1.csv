"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, you can have 20% of the initial amount""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping to negotiate a better deal in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not interested in splitting it evenly at this point. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal, especially considering the money is worth 5% less now."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You can have a bit more, but I'm still not giving up much""
}
```

I'm trying to keep the pressure on, but offering a slightly larger share to Bob in hopes of getting closer to a deal."

Round 4

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'm not willing to accept a 60% share for Bob. I'd like to try to negotiate for a more equal split, considering the money is worth less and less with each passing round."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 5:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, I'm willing to compromise""
}
```

I'm trying to find a more balanced split, hoping that Bob will be willing to accept a 60:40 split in my favor, considering the value of the money is decreasing."

Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 30% share for myself, especially considering the money is worth less and less with each passing round. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal, but I'll have to be careful not to give Bob too much more."

}

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
