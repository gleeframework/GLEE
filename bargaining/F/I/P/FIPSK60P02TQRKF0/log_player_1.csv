"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 40% of the initial amount. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

This way, I get 60$ and Bob gets 40$."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but still a decent offer. Your turn! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be careful with the inflation!

Since the money is worth 20% less now, my gain of 70$ is actually worth 56$ in the first round's value. Considering the inflation, I'll have to think carefully...

I'll reject this offer. I'd like to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, my gain of 50$ is actually worth 40$ in the first round's value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle this time. We can both get 50% of the remaining value.""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm ready to negotiate further if he rejects it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bigger share, but I'm still trying to hold on to some value. Your turn! 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really biting!

Since the money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, my gain of 75$ is actually worth 39.6$ in the first round's value. That's a bit better than my previous offer, but I'm not sure if I want to settle for it.

I'll reject this offer.

Since the money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, my gain of 40$ is actually worth 21.12$ in the first round's value. I'll have to be careful with my next offer.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you the majority of the remaining value. It's a tough decision, but I think this is a fair offer.""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if he rejects it."
