"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with this""}

I'm proposing a 60:40 split, where I get $60 and Bob gets $40. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a larger share, but I'm willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'm willing to negotiate. Since Bob is taking a larger share, I'll have to think carefully about whether to accept or reject.

After considering the offer, I've decided to:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm hoping Bob will make a more balanced offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was quite lopsided, I'll make a counteroffer that's more balanced. Here it is:

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, this is a fair compromise""}

I'm proposing a 45:55 split, where I get $45 and Bob gets $55. I think this is a more reasonable compromise, and I hope Bob will consider it."
