"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose that I receive $900,000 and Bob receives $100,000. This gives me the majority, but it's a fair starting point. I'm hoping he'll accept it to avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I would have preferred to get more, inflation is a serious threat.  I'd rather take the $100,000 now and avoid the risk of getting nothing in later rounds."
