"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $10 and keeping $90 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest.  Let's end this quickly and avoid any further inflation! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less in the second round, my gain of $50 is actually worth $45.

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 50/50 split just yet. I'll make a new proposal for Round 3."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Consider this offer!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40 and keeping $60 for myself."
