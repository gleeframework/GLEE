"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This offer is designed to be generous enough to potentially entice Bob to accept, while still leaving you with the majority of the money.  Let's see what Bob decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial proposal, accepting is the best strategy here.  Considering inflation, I would only receive 8,100 (9,000 * 0.9) if I reject and propose again. Accepting Bob's offer ensures I get at least 6,000, even with the inflation factored in."
