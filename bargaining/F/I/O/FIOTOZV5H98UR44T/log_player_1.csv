Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm taking a greedy approach! I want to maximize my share in the first round, knowing the value will decrease in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

Even though I get much less than before, accepting is the best option. My share will be worth less if I reject and it's likely Bob will continue to be greedy in future rounds."
