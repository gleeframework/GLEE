"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing to split the $1,000,000 equally between us, with each of us getting $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering I'm the one making the offer now.  What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

{""alice_gain"": 420000, ""bob_gain"": 580000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I still think 60/40 is too extreme. Let's try 42/58 instead.""}

I'm willing to give Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still trying to protect my own interests."
