"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make the first offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is a generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 5% less, but Bob's gain is still the same as before.

I'll think about it... I'm not sure if I want to give up 50% of the money, but I don't want to risk going to the next round and potentially getting an even worse deal.

I'll accept this offer.
