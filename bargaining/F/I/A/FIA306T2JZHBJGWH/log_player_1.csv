"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}

I propose a very unequal split, with me taking almost all the money. Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I'm not worried about inflation, and I'm betting that Bob will accept this offer to avoid the risk of getting nothing in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred a larger share, accepting this offer is the best option.  Even though I'm not affected by inflation, there's a risk that if I reject this offer, Bob might offer me a worse deal in the next round. A 600,000$ gain is still very good."
