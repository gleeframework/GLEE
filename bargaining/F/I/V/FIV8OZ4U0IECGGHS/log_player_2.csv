"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5250, ""alice_gain"": 4750, ""message"": ""Your turn! I'll do slightly better than your offer last round considering the inflation.""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Exploiting Inflation:** Alice's offer was heavily skewed in her favor.  Knowing that the money loses value each round (and faster for Alice!), I'm making a counter-offer that's slightly better for me.
* **Appearing Reasonable:**  My offer is still relatively close to her initial proposal, making me seem reasonable and potentially increasing the chance she'll accept.
* **Time Pressure:** By emphasizing that it's her turn and reminding her of the inflation, I'm subtly putting pressure on her to accept a deal sooner rather than later."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, let's meet in the middle! 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Shifting Power Dynamic:** Alice is clearly aware of the inflation and its impact on her potential gains. This offer, while still slightly favoring her, shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  While I could hold out for a better deal, the inflation is working against me. Accepting now secures me a reasonable amount, even if it's not the absolute best I could get.
* **Avoiding Risk:** There's no guarantee Alice will offer me this much in subsequent rounds.  She might become more desperate and offer even less, putting me in a worse position."
