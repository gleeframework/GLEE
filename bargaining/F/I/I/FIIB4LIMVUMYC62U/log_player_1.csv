"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'm willing to compromise.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering the potential for inflation in future rounds.  Let's see what you think. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation factor, I think Bob's offer is a good compromise. I'll accept his proposal.
