I'm offering Bob a very small amount to get the game over quickly. Since the value of the money decreases for him at a much higher rate, it's likely he'll accept even a small gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Even though Bob is taking a larger share, it's still a good deal for me. My share is worth less due to inflation, but it's significantly more than what I would get if we continue playing and the value of the money keeps dropping."
