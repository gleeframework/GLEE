"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  This gives Bob a small share but sets up a strong starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject this offer. While Bob's offer is generous, it is far too small for me, considering the 5% inflation. I will counter with a more equitable proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}
```

I'm proposing a 45/55 split in my favor. While I'm still feeling the effects of inflation, I'm willing to compromise to avoid further rounds and ensure we both get something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept this offer. While the inflation has significantly impacted my share, I'm not sure if I can negotiate a better deal.  At this point, it's better to secure something than risk getting nothing."
