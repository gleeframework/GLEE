"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
``` 

I'm going to propose a relatively even split. I think this is a good starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will see it as a fair offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's a significant amount, it's a huge step down from my initial proposal, and I think I can still get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm going to propose an even split again.  Bob rejected my first offer and then offered me a much lower amount. I think a 50/50 split is the fairest solution and is likely the only way to get a deal done before the money continues to devalue."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm going to accept this offer.  While the inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money, I'm not confident that I can get a better deal.  This offer is fairly close to my initial proposal, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all."
