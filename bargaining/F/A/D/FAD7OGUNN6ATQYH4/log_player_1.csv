"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a pretty generous offer, giving Bob 10% of the money.  This should make it likely he accepts, but I'm still getting the majority share. Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a much worse deal than my initial offer, and I'm not going to accept it.  Bob is being greedy, but I'm not going to let him take advantage of me. I'm going to see what he'll do in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to stick with my original strategy of offering a generous amount to Bob while still securing the majority share.  Since he rejected my offer last round, I'm reducing my own share slightly to see if he'll come around."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still being greedy and trying to squeeze more out of me.  Even though inflation is hitting me harder, I'm not going to cave in. I'm holding out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm sticking to my strategy of offering a good deal to Bob, but I'm reducing my own share again to make it clear that I won't accept his lowball offers.  Hopefully, he'll see that we both need to be more reasonable to get anything at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still being unreasonable, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of inflation. I'm not going to accept this offer, but I'm starting to think I need to be more flexible. Maybe I should try a different approach."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

Okay, I'm going to try a different approach. Bob is clearly trying to maximize his gains, but I'm also running out of time. I'm going to offer him a more even split this time, hoping that he'll be more inclined to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Inflation is hitting me hard, and I don't want to risk getting nothing.  While Bob is still getting a good deal, at least we're both getting something. Time to cut my losses and move on."
