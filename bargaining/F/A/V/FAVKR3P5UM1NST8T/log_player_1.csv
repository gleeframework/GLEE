Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair to split the money evenly. I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share this time since you didn't accept my offer last round. This way, we can both walk away with something. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic.  The value is dropping fast. I'm offering you $4,500, which is more than you'd get if you stall and win in round 4. Take the deal now, it's a win-win!""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  It's Round 3, and the value is decreasing rapidly. Bob needs to understand that delaying further hurts both of us.
* **Strategic Calculation:** Bob's offer in Round 2 was heavily in his favor. By Round 4, even if he gets his way, the inflation will have eaten into his gains significantly.  My offer of $4,500 now is more valuable than a potential $6,000 in Round 4 for him.
* **Appearing Reasonable:** While I could aim for a higher share, a slightly more ""generous"" offer might entice Bob to accept and avoid the risk of further devaluation."
