**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:**  The value of the money is decreasing significantly for us with each round. Waiting any longer will only result in a worse deal for us, even if Bob were to offer slightly more.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Bob is unlikely to offer a drastically better deal in future rounds. His offers have been consistently in his favor, and he knows the pressure is on us due to inflation. 
* **Certainty vs. Risk:** Accepting this offer guarantees a reasonable amount now. Rejecting it risks getting a worse deal later, potentially leaving us with even less than what's currently on the table."
