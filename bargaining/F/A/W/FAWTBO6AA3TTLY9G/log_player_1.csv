"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a small portion this round""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80$ and leaving 20$ for Bob. I'm framing it as a fair split, hoping to set a good tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but still a bit more for me this round 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of 60$ is actually worth 60 * 0.9 = 54$ (since I'm 10% worse off).

I'm not thrilled with this offer, as it's still a bit more skewed towards Bob. However, I don't want to risk getting an even worse deal in the next round.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
