Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm Bob, and I want a better deal.  100,000 is too low, especially given the potential for inflation. I'm going to try and negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a fair deal, and I'm willing to give Alice a good portion of the money.  Let's see if she's reasonable."
