Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the inflation is hurting you, but I think 58/42 is a more suitable split given the current situation. 
# Alice gain: 420000 
# Bob gain: 580000

""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob acknowledges the inflation, his offer is getting worse for me with each round. It's clear he's trying to exploit the situation.  I need to hold firm and make him realize that dragging this out won't get him a drastically better deal.  I'm willing to accept a slightly less favorable split due to the inflation, but not this much."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 480000,
""bob_gain"": 520000,
""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to be flexible, but this needs to end.  This is my final offer, take it or leave it.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** Every round significantly reduces the value of the potential gain for me due to inflation. A deal needs to be reached quickly. 
* **Show Flexibility:**  By increasing my offer to a 52/48 split in Bob's favor, I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise.  
* **Finality:**  By stating this is my final offer, I'm hoping to force Bob to seriously consider the immediate gain versus the risk of continued stalemate.  

If Bob continues to push, I will be forced to drastically lower my expectations in later rounds to salvage any worthwhile portion of the deal before inflation erodes its value completely."
