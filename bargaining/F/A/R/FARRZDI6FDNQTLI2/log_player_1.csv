"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a fair offer, but giving myself a slight advantage. I'm hoping Bob will accept, but if not, I'll adjust my strategy for the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While it's not ideal, accepting this offer is the best option. After the 5% inflation, I would be getting only 42.5% of the money if I were to reject this offer and make a counter proposal. It's better to secure half now than risk losing a larger share later."
