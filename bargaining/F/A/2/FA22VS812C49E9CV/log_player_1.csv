"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start with!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

I'm not thrilled about accepting an offer that gives me a smaller share, but I don't want to risk going to the next round and losing more value due to inflation. Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll accept Bob's offer this time.
