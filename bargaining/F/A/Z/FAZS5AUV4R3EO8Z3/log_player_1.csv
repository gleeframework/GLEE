Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a fairly even split, but heavily in my favor. I figure Bob will be eager to get something rather than risk getting nothing at all in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, this is a much fairer split than the previous round. Accepting ensures I get a significant amount of money, and with the inflation rate, I risk getting nothing if I reject and the game continues."
