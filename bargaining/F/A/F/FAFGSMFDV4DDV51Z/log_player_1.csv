Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. We can both do better than Alice's offer, even with the inflation 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split in Round 2 is better than risking further inflation. Here's why:

* **Inflation Hurts Bob More:** Bob's share loses value much faster than mine. This means he's more incentivized to reach a deal quickly.
* **Future Uncertainty:** There's no guarantee I'll get a better offer from Bob in subsequent rounds. He might propose something even worse, and the value will continue to decrease.
* **Fair Compromise:**  A 50/50 split, even with some inflation, is a fair compromise and ensures I don't walk away empty-handed."
