"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take 60% and you take 40%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me taking $600,000 and Bob taking $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You took 60% last round, I'll take 70% this time 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 5% decrease in value due to inflation, I'll have to accept a lower amount this time.

I'll decide to reject this offer. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""You took 70% last round, I'll take 42% this time to balance it out""
}
