"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you a good deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40, which is a 40% share of the original $100. This way, I'll get $60, which is a 60% share. I'm hoping Bob will accept this generous offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a good chunk, but I'm not giving up too much 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $70 is now worth 5% less than the $60 I would have gotten in the first round, which is $57. And Bob's gain of $30 is now worth 10% less than the $40 he would have gotten in the first round, which is $28.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. I'm getting a bit less than I would have gotten in the first round, but Bob is also getting less than he would have gotten. I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a small share, but I need more for myself!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share this time, but I'm hoping he'll accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm still not giving up too much 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values:

My gain of $75 is worth 14.26% less than the $60 I would have gotten in the first round, which is approximately $51.67.

Bob's gain of $25 is worth 27.1% less than the $40 he would have gotten in the first round, which is approximately $29.09.

I'm getting a bit more than I would have gotten in the previous round, but Bob is also getting a bit more. I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 85,
  ""bob_gain"": 15,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a tiny share, but I'm taking most of the cake!""
}
```

I'm being a bit more aggressive this time, trying to get a larger share of the remaining money."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you most of it, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of 
# Alice gain: 90 
# Bob gain: 10 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values:

My gain of $90 is worth 22.62% less than the $60 I would have gotten in the first round, which is approximately $46.38.

Bob's gain of $10 is worth 40.95% less than the $40 he would have gotten in the first round, which is approximately $23.8.

This is a pretty generous offer from Bob, considering the inflation. I'm getting a significant share of the remaining money, and Bob is getting a relatively small share. I think I should accept this offer.
