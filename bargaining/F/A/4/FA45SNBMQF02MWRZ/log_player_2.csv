"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, I'll make a new proposal. Considering the 20% inflation, my proposal is to take 6,667 and leave 3,333 for Alice. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 6667,
""alice_gain"": 3333}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of 4000 in this round is equivalent to 6000 in the first round. I'm not sure if Alice's gain is equivalent to 6000 in the first round, but since it's the same as the first round, I'll assume it's equivalent to 6000 in this round as well.

Given that my gain is 4000 in this round, which is 36% less than my proposed 6667 in the second round, I think this offer is a better deal for me. I accept Alice's offer.
