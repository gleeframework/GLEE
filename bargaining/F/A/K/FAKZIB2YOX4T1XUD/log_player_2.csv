Alice's offer:

Round 2

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Alice, your offer was too low. Let's be reasonable. I'll take $60, you take $40. This is a fair deal considering the inflation.""}

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. Inflation is hurting both of us. I'll take $60, leaving you with $40. It's better than dragging this out further and losing even more. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
