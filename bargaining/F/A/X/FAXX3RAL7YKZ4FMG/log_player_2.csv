Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation working against me. While her offer is getting closer to a ""fair"" split in her eyes, it's becoming increasingly worse for me as time passes.  I need to show her I'm serious about not getting pushed around by these dwindling returns."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 470000,
""alice_gain"": 530000,
""message"": ""This offer reflects the time pressure and acknowledges the inflation disadvantage. It's crucial we settle now.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time for a strategic shift.  I need to make a concession that acknowledges the shrinking pot from my side but still maintains a position of strength.  By offering a slight majority to Alice, I'm hoping to convey:

* **Understanding of the Situation:** I'm not oblivious to her advantage.
* **Urgency:**  We're running out of time, and further delays only hurt me.
* **Willingness to Compromise (Slightly):**  A 53/47 split is not ideal, but it's better than the trend Alice is trying to establish.

This offer attempts to find a balance between accepting a less-than-ideal deal and risking a total loss as the rounds progress."

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is really hurting you, I'm willing to take a bit less than before 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a tough one! Let's analyze:

**Pros of Accepting:**

* **Something is better than nothing:** If we don't settle now, we risk walking away with nothing.
* **Alice is acknowledging the inflation:** Her offer is slightly better than her previous one, suggesting she understands the time pressure.

**Cons of Accepting:**

* **Still a significant loss:**  A 45/55 split is far from ideal, and the inflation makes it even worse for you in real terms.
* **Setting a precedent:** Accepting this could signal to Alice that you're desperate and willing to take a bad deal in later rounds.

**Decision:**

This is a gamble. I'm leaning towards **{""decision"": ""reject""}** one last time.  

**Reasoning:**

We're entering the final stages, and Alice knows it. There's a chance she might panic and offer a more reasonable deal in the next round to avoid getting nothing at all. This is a calculated risk, but the potential loss from accepting her current offer outweighs the potential gain in my opinion."

Round 10
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 460000,
""alice_gain"": 540000,
""message"": ""This is my final offer.  Take it or leave it.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is it, the endgame.  I'm sticking close to my previous offer while injecting a sense of urgency and finality. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:**  We have only two rounds left. Alice knows the deal has to be made now or never.
* **Conveying Strength:**  By saying ""final offer,"" I'm communicating that I'm not desperate enough to cave further. 
* **Slight Improvement:** Offering 460,000 is a small improvement for Alice, potentially enough to tip the scales without giving away too much more.

There's a significant risk Alice might reject this, but the potential reward of securing a deal now outweighs the potential loss of chasing an even worse outcome in the final round."
