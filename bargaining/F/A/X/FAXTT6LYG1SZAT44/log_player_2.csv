Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want a larger share, but consider the inflation. This 55/45 split is a compromise, giving me a bit more to offset the decreasing value. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
