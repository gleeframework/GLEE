I propose a 5500/4500 split in my favor. This is a fair and balanced division, allowing us both to receive a significant portion of the money.  Let's get this game started!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I propose a 50/50 split.  Given the inflation and Bob's previous rejection, I believe this is a fair and equitable solution. Let's end this game on a mutually beneficial note."
