"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a split of 900,000 for me and 100,000 for Bob.  It's a pretty big advantage for me, but I want to see if he'll accept it in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, I'm accepting Bob's offer. With the inflation, my share is worth less, and if I reject, I risk getting even less in the next round."
