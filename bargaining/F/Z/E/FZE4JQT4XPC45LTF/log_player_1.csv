"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $4,000, and I'll take $6,000. What do you think?""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll match your fairness, but I'd like to propose a 50/50 split. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the numbers are:

* Alice gain: 5000
* Bob gain: 4750

I'm not sure I like the 50/50 split as much as my original offer, but it's a good compromise. I'll accept Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
