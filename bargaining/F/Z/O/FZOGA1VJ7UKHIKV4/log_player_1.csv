"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a more reasonable split, considering the risk of rejection and the inflation rate. Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
