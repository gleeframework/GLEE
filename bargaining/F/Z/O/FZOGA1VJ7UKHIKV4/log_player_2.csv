"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my first offer, I believe it's fair to take most of the money since I'm the one taking the risk of you rejecting it.  But feel free to counter-propose if you'd like. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counter-proposal. Please let me know when it's my turn!\n\n###\n\n(Bob's aside: I think Alice is being a bit too greedy, and I believe I can get a better deal. Plus, the inflation rate is in my favor - the money is worth 20% less for me with each passing round, so I'm not losing as much value as Alice is.)\n\n###\n\nPlease relay my decision to Alice!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'd like to make a counter-proposal. Here's my offer:\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""I think this is a more reasonable split, considering the risk of rejection and the inflation rate. Let's meet in the middle!""}\n\n###\n\nPlease relay my offer to Alice!\n\n###\n\n(Bob's aside: I'm hoping Alice will see that I'm willing to compromise and meet her halfway. The inflation rate is still in my favor, but I don't want to push my luck too far.)\n\n###\n\nLet me know what Alice thinks!"
