"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take the first turn.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor, which is a relatively generous offer considering I get to make the first move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly more optimistic approach this time, hoping you'll accept! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is starting to bite!

Considering the reduced value of my potential gain, I'll have to be more cautious. Bob's offer is a bit more generous than my previous one, but I'm not sure if I'm ready to accept it yet.

I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll aim for a slightly higher share to compensate for the reduced value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, considering the inflation. Let's try to find a mutually beneficial solution! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain! Considering the reduced value of my potential gain, I'm starting to get a bit desperate.

However, Bob's offer is actually a slight improvement over my previous offer, and meeting halfway seems like a reasonable compromise. I'll accept the offer.
