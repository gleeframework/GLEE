Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable.  We're both losing money with each passing round. A 50/50 split is the fairest solution, and it allows us to walk away with something. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 
 
Even with inflation, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is not in Alice's best interest.  While it seems fair on the surface, Bob is losing money at a slower rate. Alice needs to push for a better deal in the next round."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're both losing more and more money with each passing round. This offer is a compromise,  but it's getting increasingly risky to keep rejecting proposals. Let's make a decision that benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the situation. While the offer is slightly better than a 50/50 split, it's still heavily skewed in Bob's favor considering the faster rate of inflation on Alice's side.  Alice needs to hold firm and make it clear she won't accept an unfair deal."

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we are both losing a significant amount of money with every passing round. This offer is a compromise, and it allows us to both walk away with something.  Let's not risk getting nothing at all. 
# Alice gain: 5400 
# Bob gain: 4600 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

This is a tough decision, but time is running out.  While the deal still favors Bob, accepting ensures Alice gets something. Rejecting carries significant risk. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** Only 4 rounds remain.  Inflation will drastically erode any potential gains if an agreement isn't reached soon.
* **Bob's Stance:** Bob has consistently aimed for a larger share.  It's unlikely he'll offer significantly more in subsequent rounds. 
* **Certainty vs. Risk:** Accepting now guarantees a payout, even if not ideal. Rejecting gambles on Bob becoming more generous under pressure, a risky bet. 

While disappointing, taking the $5400 (heavily impacted by inflation) is the most rational decision at this late stage to avoid walking away with nothing."
