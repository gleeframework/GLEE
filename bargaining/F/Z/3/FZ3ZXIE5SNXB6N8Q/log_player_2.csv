"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects the urgency for both of us to reach an agreement. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

It's a bit unfair for Alice to get 6000 while Bob only gets 4000. Even though the money is worth less in later rounds, it's worth trying to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better.  I'm willing to give you a slightly higher share, but I need a little more for myself.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic.  This offer is better than what we'll both get if this drags on. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is slightly better than her initial proposal, it's still not a fair split considering the inflation and the fact that we both get nothing if we don't reach an agreement. I'll try to negotiate a more even split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be reasonable.  We're both losing money with each passing round. A 50/50 split is the fairest solution, and it allows us to walk away with something.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time.  This offer is a compromise, and it's the best you'll get at this point. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While I'm running out of time, I still think we can get a more fair deal. I'm willing to continue negotiating to find a more balanced split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""Alice, we're both losing more and more money with each passing round. This offer is a compromise,  but it's getting increasingly risky to keep rejecting proposals. Let's make a decision that benefits us both.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm offering you a deal where you still get more than 40% after inflation. Accept this now, or the next offer will be even less appealing for you. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Although Alice's offer is slightly better than the last round, I'm still holding out for a more equitable split. While time is running out, I believe we can reach a more balanced agreement in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4600, ""alice_gain"": 5400, ""message"": ""Alice, we are both losing a significant amount of money with every passing round. This offer is a compromise, and it allows us to both walk away with something.  Let's not risk getting nothing at all.""}
