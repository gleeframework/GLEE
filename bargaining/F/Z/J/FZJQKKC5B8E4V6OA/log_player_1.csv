"Round 1

{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I propose that I get $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000. This is a generous starting offer that allows for potential negotiation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm reducing my offer slightly to 700,000 for myself and 300,000 for Bob. This is still a fair offer, given that Bob's share is worth less due to inflation. I hope this encourages him to accept."

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
Bob's offer is still too low. While his offer is worth less due to inflation, I still have the advantage in this round. I will continue to propose an offer that is more favorable to me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
``` 

I'm offering 600,000 for myself and 400,000 for Bob. This is a slight decrease from my previous offer, but I'm still willing to compromise. As the rounds progress, it is increasingly important to secure a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
Bob's offer is getting closer, but I believe I can still get a better deal. I'm sticking with my strategy of making slightly lower offers each round, hoping to eventually find a compromise that Bob will accept."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
``` 

I'm offering 550,000 for myself and 450,000 for Bob. With each passing round, the pressure mounts. This offer is my attempt to bridge the gap and find a mutually agreeable solution before the time runs out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

It's getting late, and the value of Bob's share keeps decreasing.  While I'd prefer a larger share, a 50/50 split is the most favorable outcome I can secure at this point."
