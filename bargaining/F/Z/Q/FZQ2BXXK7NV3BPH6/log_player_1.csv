"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

This offer gives me $600,000 and Bob $400,000, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly bigger share 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth less after inflation, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

I'll consider Bob's offer, but I think I can do better. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think I deserve a bit more. Let's try again.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 20% less than in Round 2, so I'll have to be even more careful with my proposal.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give away too much. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

This offer gives me $480,000 and Bob $520,000, which is a slightly more favorable split for me, but still a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet in the middle, but I think I deserve a slight edge. Let's try to find a compromise 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth significantly less after inflation, I'll have to be more cautious with my decisions.

Considering Bob's offer, I think this is a reasonable compromise. The split is 50/50, which is a fair middle ground. I'll accept this offer.
