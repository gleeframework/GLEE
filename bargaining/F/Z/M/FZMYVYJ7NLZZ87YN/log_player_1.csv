Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. This is a fair starting point.

# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. We both get a decent share before the value continues to decline. Let's reach an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting better, but it's still heavily skewed in his favor.  The declining value significantly impacts him, making him more amenable to a fairer deal as time goes on. By rejecting this offer, I'm betting he'll be forced to offer a much larger share in the next round to avoid losing out on even more value."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 700000,
""bob_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Bob, the pot is shrinking rapidly for you. Let's be realistic - this is my final offer. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time pressure:**  We're reaching a critical point where Bob's share is eroding quickly.  This puts significant pressure on him to accept a less favorable deal.
* **Strong stance:** By framing this as my ""final offer"", I'm communicating that I'm unwilling to budge further. This might push Bob to accept before his position weakens further. 
* **Significant but not unreasonable:** While 70/30 is a strong split in my favor, it's not so extreme that Bob wouldn't consider it, especially given the circumstances."
