Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, it's a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%."

# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it.
