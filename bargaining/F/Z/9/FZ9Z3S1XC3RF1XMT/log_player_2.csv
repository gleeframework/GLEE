**Reasoning:**

While Alice is offering a slightly better deal, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. The longer this goes on, the less Bob's potential earnings are worth due to inflation. It's a gamble, but holding out for a better offer in the next few rounds might be necessary, even if it means risking a worse outcome later."
