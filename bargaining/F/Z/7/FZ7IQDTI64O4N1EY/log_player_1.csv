Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair to me!"

# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain remains the same in value, I'd rather aim for a higher amount. I'll reject this offer.
