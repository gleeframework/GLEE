"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair!""}\n\n###\n\nI am offering Bob 45% of the money and keeping 55% for myself. I believe this is a reasonable and fair offer, considering the decreasing value of money over time.\n\nPlease respond with Bob's decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, but let's wrap this up. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting this offer. Although Bob is being generous, I believe I can get a better deal considering the inflation rate is higher for me. Let's proceed to the next round.\n\nPlease send my next proposal to Bob. 

### 
My next offer:
{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Consider the inflation!""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nActually, I've already sent my next offer:
{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Consider the inflation!""}\n\nPlease proceed with Bob's decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a fair deal. Take it or leave it, the clock is ticking. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on my potential gain, I believe accepting this 50/50 split is the best decision. The decreasing value of money over time has reduced the value of my potential gain, and further rounds may lead to an even less desirable outcome. It's time to accept this fair deal and conclude the game."
