I'm going to start with a relatively high offer for myself, hoping Bob will accept it in the first round.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer more, it's better to take a 50/50 split than risk getting nothing in the later rounds."
