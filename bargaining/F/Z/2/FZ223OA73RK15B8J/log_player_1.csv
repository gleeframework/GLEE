"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle. What do you say, Bob?""
}
```

This offer gives me $600,000 and Bob $400,000, which is a 60-40 split. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take advantage of me in the second round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not interested in giving up 70% of the remaining $1,000,000. I'd like to make my own offer in the next round."
