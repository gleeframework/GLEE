"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take a slightly smaller share this time 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting that Bob thinks I was being too generous!

I'll think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but the money Bob gains is worth 20% less, I'm effectively losing 20% of the value of the money I gain compared to the first round.

Considering this, I'll reject Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a bit too generous for him, I'll try to make a more balanced offer this time. I'll take a slightly smaller share, but still a bit more than Bob's previous offer.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's make a deal!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'm not giving up yet! 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a better deal.

Considering the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth significantly less due to inflation, I'll reject this offer.

However, I'll have to be careful not to get too greedy, as the value of the money is decreasing rapidly.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","It's time for me to make another offer. Given the rapid inflation, I'll try to get a better deal while still being reasonable.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""Let's compromise, before it's too late!""
}
```

I'm taking a slightly smaller share, but still trying to get a good deal before the value of the money drops too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not backing down, I want more! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is becoming more aggressive in his demands.

Considering the massive inflation that has occurred, I'm starting to get worried that the value of the money will drop to almost nothing if we don't make a deal soon. However, I'm not willing to give in to Bob's demands just yet.

I'll reject this offer and try to make another proposal:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The value of the money is dropping rapidly, and I need to make a decision soon. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time, hoping to get a better deal before it's too late.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3800,
  ""bob_gain"": 6200,
  ""message"": ""Last chance, let's make a deal before it's worthless!""
}
```

I'm taking a slightly smaller share, but I'm trying to get as much as I can before the value of the money drops to almost nothing."
