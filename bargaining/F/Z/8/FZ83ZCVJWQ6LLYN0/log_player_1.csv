"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Accept and we can split the bills!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 30$ and keeping 70$ for myself. The message is a friendly suggestion to accept the offer and end the game."
