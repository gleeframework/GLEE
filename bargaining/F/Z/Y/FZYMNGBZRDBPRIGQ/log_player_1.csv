"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly, considering the inflation risk""}\n\n###\n\nI'll offer Bob $4000 and keep $6000 for myself, considering that with each passing round, the money loses value for me due to inflation. This way, we both get a significant amount, and it's fair given the circumstances."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split considering the inflation risk, and it gives us both a good starting point. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI will reject this offer because, although the money's value decreases for me with each round, accepting $4500 now (which is effectively less due to inflation) seems less favorable compared to trying to negotiate for a better split in the next round, considering Bob's gain remains unaffected by inflation.\n\n###\n\nLet's proceed and see if we can reach a more favorable agreement in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering the increasing inflation impact on me, this seems like a reasonable adjustment""}\n\n###\n\nGiven the ongoing inflation, I'll slightly adjust my initial offer to give Bob a bit more, hoping this compromise will be acceptable to him. Since the money's value decreases for me with each round, finding a middle ground is essential to avoid further devaluation of my potential gain.\n\n###\n\nLet's see if Bob is willing to accept this adjusted proposal."
