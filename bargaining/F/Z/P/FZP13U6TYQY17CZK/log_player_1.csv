Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a pretty generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a quick deal.  Let's see if he's feeling cooperative!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. Bob is being very greedy. While he's benefiting from inflation, I still have 11 rounds to try and get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm going to reduce my offer slightly, but still offer Bob a decent share. It's risky, but I hope it's enough to convince him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too greedy. I'm losing a lot to inflation and have only 8 rounds left, but I need to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm going to keep lowering my offer gradually, hoping to find a compromise point.  Inflation is really starting to hurt, but I still believe there's room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While the offer is better than previous rounds, I'm losing a lot of value due to inflation. I have 6 rounds left, and I'm still hopeful for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

Inflation is getting serious, but I need to keep trying. I'm going to make one last compromise, but if Bob rejects this, I might have to accept a worse deal just to avoid getting nothing."
