"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair and reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'm keeping most of the pie 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to get the better end of the deal!

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I'm not willing to accept such a low share, especially considering the inflation effect that's reducing the value of the money I gain. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm still willing to compromise""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and being willing to compromise, while also considering the ongoing inflation. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I'm still trying to get the better end of the deal 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to squeeze out a better deal!

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer again because, although Bob is giving me a slightly bigger share, it's still not enough considering the inflation effect that's reducing the value of the money I gain. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I need a better deal to make it worth my while""
}
```

I'm trying to push for a slightly better share for myself, considering the ongoing inflation. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not giving away the whole farm 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is still trying to get the better end of the deal!

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting this offer because, although it's not ideal, it's getting close to the 50/50 split I initially proposed, and the inflation effect is making it harder for me to wait for a better offer. I'll take what I can get!"
