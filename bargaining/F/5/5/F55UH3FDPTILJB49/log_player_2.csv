"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I'll take the majority but leave you something.  We can negotiate further if you'd like.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit. This offer is closer to your suggestion, but I still need a larger share to make it worthwhile for me.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, the deal still heavily favors her, especially considering her money is decreasing in value each round. I'm aiming for a more equitable outcome and believe I can achieve that in the remaining rounds."
