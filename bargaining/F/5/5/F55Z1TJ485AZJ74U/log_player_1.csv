  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll evaluate the offer based on the same value.

Bob's offer is:
Alice gain: $4,000 (worth the same as $4,000 in the first round)
Bob gain: $6,000 (worth 95% of $6,333 in the first round, due to 5% inflation)

I'll reject this offer because it's not favorable to me. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob.
