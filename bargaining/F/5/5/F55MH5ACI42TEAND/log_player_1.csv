Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose an equal split of $5,000 each. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more money, accepting this offer is the best option.  The inflation will continue to erode the value of any future offers I might get, so it's better to take what I can now."
