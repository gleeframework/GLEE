"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I, Alice, propose to take $55, which is a bit more than half of the total amount, and Bob will receive $45. The message attached is a brief explanation of the reasoning behind the proposal, aiming to persuade Bob to accept the offer. The game has just started, and considering the impact of inflation, it might be beneficial for Bob to accept this offer rather than proceeding to the next round where the money's value decreases significantly for him. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your turn to be fair, how about this? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nConsidering the effects of inflation, the current offer values are actually 5% less for me and 20% less for Bob compared to the original amounts. This means the offer is effectively $42.75 for me (45 * 0.95) and $44 for Bob (55 * 0.80). Given this, and the fact that Bob is offering me less than what I initially proposed, I will reject this offer. The game is now moving to the next round where I will make a new proposal. The strategy here is to wait for a better offer or to make a counteroffer that might be more favorable considering the decreasing value of money for both of us, especially the steeper decrease for Bob.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nIn this round, considering the effects of inflation, the total value for both of us has decreased again. For me, the value is 5% less than the previous round, and for Bob, it's 20% less. Strategically, I should propose an offer that seems fair given the current circumstances but still leans in my favor, as the pressure of decreasing value, especially for Bob, might encourage him to accept a reasonable offer rather than risking further loss in value. This time, I'll propose a division that gives me slightly more than before, considering Bob's rejection and the decreasing value of money for both of us.

{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is more than fair now.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's just split it evenly before inflation eats up all the gains. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","At this point, the effects of inflation have significantly reduced the value of the money for both of us, but much more so for Bob. Bob's offer to split the money evenly might seem fair at face value, but considering the inflation, the actual value I would receive is $42.87 (50 * 0.8574, since the value has decreased by 14.26% for me from the original), and Bob would get $25.60 (50 * 0.512, as the value has decreased by 48.8% for him). Given this significant disparity in the value we'd actually receive and considering my goal to maximize my gain, I should reject this offer. The decreasing value of money, especially for Bob, puts pressure on him, and I might be able to propose a more favorable offer in the next round or wait for a better offer from him.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In this round, the effects of inflation have further decreased the value of money for both of us, but the impact on Bob's potential gain is much more severe. Given this scenario, I should make an offer that reflects the current state of affairs, where Bob is under more pressure due to the significant decrease in value on his side. My strategy is to offer Bob a smaller share, considering that the actual value he would receive is drastically reduced, while I aim to maximize my gain from the remaining value.
