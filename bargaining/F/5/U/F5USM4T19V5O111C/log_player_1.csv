"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to offer Bob a small share to start with.  I'm hoping he'll accept, but I'm also aware that the money will be worth less in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred a larger share, accepting this offer ensures that I receive a significant portion of the money.  The inflation rate means that the value of my share will continue to decrease with each round, making this a reasonable offer to accept."
