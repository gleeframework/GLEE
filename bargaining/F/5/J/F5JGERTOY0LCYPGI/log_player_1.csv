"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 40, you can try to negotiate""
}
```

This way, I'm giving Bob 40 dollars, and keeping 60 for myself, with the hope that he'll think it's a fair starting point and we can negotiate from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll try to get a better deal, but I'll start with a fair split 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation, my gain of 50 dollars is now worth 40 dollars. Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, which is a fair offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll reject this offer to try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain of 50 dollars is now worth 40 dollars. I'll try to make a slightly more aggressive offer to see if Bob will accept.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit less, but I'm still willing to compromise""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll try to get a better deal, but I'll give you a bit more 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 48.8% inflation, my gain of 55 dollars is now worth 28.34 dollars. Bob's offer is a 45-55 split, which is a bit more in his favor than my previous offer. Considering the inflation, I'm not sure if I can do better. I'll accept this offer.
