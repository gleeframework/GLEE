"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a small amount to keep you engaged.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $10,000, and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fairer, considering the inflation affecting us both. Let's start with this and see how the game goes. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation factor, I'll have to adjust my decision.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to accept a 45% gain for myself, considering the inflation affects me more severely than you.""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and would like to make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation factor, the money is now worth less than before. I'll make a new offer:

  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more due to the initial proposal I made.""
}
```"
