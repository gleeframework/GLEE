"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take the higher share, but it's a fair start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I receive $700,000 and Bob receives $300,000. I'm framing it as a fair start, but I'm really trying to get the higher share to set the tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slight adjustment to make it more balanced. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

In terms of the actual amount, I'd be getting $600,000, which is equivalent to $600,000 / 0.9 = $666,667 in the first round's money. That's a decent amount, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to do better in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll aim to get a higher share to compensate for the decrease in value.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly lower share, but I'm still looking for a better deal.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I receive $750,000 and Bob receives $250,000. I'm trying to convey that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still looking for a better deal."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better deal. 
# Alice gain: 680000 
# Bob gain: 320000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

In terms of the actual amount, I'd be getting $680,000, which is equivalent to $680,000 / 0.727 = $933,333 in the first round's money. That's a decent amount, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'll aim to get a higher share to compensate for the decrease in value.

  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit impatient, but I'm willing to give you a slightly lower share. Meet me in the middle?""
}
```

I'm proposing that I receive $800,000 and Bob receives $200,000. I'm trying to convey that I'm getting a bit frustrated, but I'm still willing to compromise and meet Bob in the middle."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still hoping for a better deal, but I'm willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 720000 
# Bob gain: 280000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 40.95% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

In terms of the actual amount, I'd be getting $720,000, which is equivalent to $720,000 / 0.5915 = $1,216,333 in the first round's money. That's a significant amount, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

Considering the decreasing value of money and the fact that Bob is getting a relatively high share, I'll accept this offer. It's not the best deal, but it's a decent compromise.
