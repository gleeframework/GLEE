"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my offer for Round 1:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```
This way, I get the majority of the money, but still leave Bob with a decent amount. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to adjust my strategy.

I'll accept Bob's offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```
This way, we can finalize the division and split the money evenly."
