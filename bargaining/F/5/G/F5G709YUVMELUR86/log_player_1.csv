"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
This offer gives me the majority of the money, but it leaves Bob with something to consider.  I'll see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. Even though my share is smaller, it's still worth more to me than what Bob is offering.  I'll wait for my turn to make a counter-proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I'm going to offer a slight decrease from my initial offer, hoping to encourage Bob to accept before the inflation kicks in again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial offer, the inflation is hitting him harder than me.  It's better to take this offer than risk getting less in the next round."
