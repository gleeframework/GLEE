Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm serious about getting this deal done, but it has to be fair. 62/38 is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the pressure is on, accepting this offer means losing a significant amount of money due to inflation. Alice is clearly trying to anchor the negotiations in her favor.  I'll make one more strong counter-offer before considering less favorable terms."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but you're leaving me no choice. This is a final compromise - take it or leave it.  
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

The game has reached a critical point. While the offer is far from ideal, with the increasing inflation, rejecting it carries the risk of ending up with even less or nothing at all. Accepting secures a reasonable amount, even with the inflation factored in. It's better to secure something than risk losing everything in the hopes of a better deal."
