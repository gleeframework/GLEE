"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I'm offering you 400,000$. This way, I'll get 60% of the original 1,000,000$. It's a decent split, and I'm hoping you'll accept it to avoid further negotiations."
