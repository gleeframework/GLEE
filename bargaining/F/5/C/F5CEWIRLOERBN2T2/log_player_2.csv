Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

``` 

Reasoning:

While not ideal, Alice's offer in Round 5 is the best I'm likely to get at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is rapidly decreasing for Alice, making her more likely to accept a lower amount as time goes on. However, this also means that if I reject this offer and make my own in the next round, Alice might be willing to accept even less than $400,000. 
* **Final offer:** Alice has stated this is her final offer. There's no guarantee she'll offer anything close to this amount in subsequent rounds.
* **Certainty:** Accepting this offer guarantees I receive $400,000. Rejecting it carries the risk of getting an even lower amount later or, in the worst-case scenario, reaching a stalemate where we both get nothing.

Therefore, accepting the $400,000 offer in Round 5 is the most logical decision to maximize my gains, even though it's less than what I aimed for initially."
