"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, a fair starting point""}

I'm proposing that I receive 80% of the total amount, and Bob receives 20%. I think this is a good starting point, and it gives me a decent buffer in case things get tough later on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, let's try a more balanced split! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with Bob's offer. I was expecting a more substantial gain, especially considering the inflation has reduced the value of the money. I think I can do better than 10% of the total amount. I'll reject this offer and hope to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, let's try a 3:2 split""}

I'm reducing my gain by 20% from the previous round, hoping to find a more acceptable middle ground. I'm still hoping to get a decent share of the money, but I'm willing to compromise to move the negotiation forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not giving up much more 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with Bob's offer again. The inflation has reduced the value of the money significantly, and I'm still not getting a fair share. I was hoping for a more substantial gain, especially considering Bob's gain is still relatively high. I'll reject this offer and try to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give a bit more, but I need a better deal""}

I'm increasing my gain by 50% from the previous round, trying to find a more acceptable middle ground. I'm still hoping to get a decent share of the money, and I'm willing to compromise to move the negotiation forward."
