"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, it's a fair start""}

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55-45 split is a bit more equitable, considering the inflation we'll face if we keep going. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not satisfied with the 55-45 split, especially considering that the money is already worth 5% less than it was in the first round. I think I can do better than that."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 52-48 is a more reasonable split given the inflation. Let's try to find a middle ground""}

I'm proposing a 52-48 split, which is closer to my initial offer, but still takes into account the inflation."
