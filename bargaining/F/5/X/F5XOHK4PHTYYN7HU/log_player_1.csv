"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a proposal that gives me a decent amount while still leaving room for negotiation. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

This gives me $60 and leaves $40 for Bob. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, I'll have to adjust my expectations due to the 5% decrease in value of the money I gain. Considering Bob's offer, I'll think for a moment...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a new offer that takes into account the continued inflation. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

This is a 50/50 split, which is a relatively fair offer considering the decreasing value of the money. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
