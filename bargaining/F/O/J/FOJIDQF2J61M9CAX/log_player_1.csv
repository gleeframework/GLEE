Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a pretty aggressive offer. Since we have 12 rounds, I figure I can be a little greedy in the early stages and still leave room for negotiation later if necessary.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is still pretty generous, considering the inflation.  Since I don't know how inflation is affecting him, it's best to accept this and secure a good portion of the money.  There's always a chance we could reach a better agreement later, but it's risky to keep rejecting offers."
