"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it to avoid further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous in the first round. I'll take a bigger share this time. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is looking to take a bigger share now.

I'll have to adjust my expectations due to the 5% inflation. My $900,000 from the first round is now worth $855,000 in terms of purchasing power. So, if I accept Bob's offer, I'll be getting $300,000, which is a significant decrease from my initial offer.

I'll think carefully about this...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the 5% inflation from the previous round. Since my previous offer of $900,000 is now worth $855,000, I'll aim to keep a similar share, but adjust for the inflation.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself. This should be a more balanced proposal, considering the effects of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting greedy, Alice. I'll take the lion's share this time. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, it seems Bob is getting more aggressive!

Let's calculate the value of my money after the 3rd round of inflation. My previous offer of $900,000 is now worth $855,000, and after the 4th round of inflation, it's worth approximately $732,000 (a 14.26% decrease).

Considering Bob's offer, I'd be getting $100,000, which is a significant decrease from my previous offers. I'm not sure if it's worth accepting, but I'll think carefully about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the 14.26% inflation from the previous round. Since my previous offer of $900,000 is now worth $732,000, I'll aim to keep a similar share, but adjust for the inflation.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to compromise.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. This should be a more reasonable proposal, considering the effects of inflation."
