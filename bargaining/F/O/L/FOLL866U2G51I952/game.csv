65.0,35.0,"Bob, I'm willing to compromise. Let's try a 65/35 split in my favor this round. It's a fairer split than your proposal, and it gives you a chance to get something before inflation eats away at your share even more.",Alice,3,

45.0,55.0,"Alice, let's be reasonable.  I'm proposing a 55/45 split.  It's closer to even and gives us both a decent share while we still have time.",Bob,4,

70.0,30.0,"Bob, we're running out of time. I'm willing to go up to a 70/30 split in my favor, but we need to reach an agreement soon.  Inflation is hurting us both, and if we don't settle, we'll both end up with nothing.",Alice,5,
