Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to compromise. Let's try a 65/35 split in my favor this round. It's a fairer split than your proposal, and it gives you a chance to get something before inflation eats away at your share even more. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be reasonable.  I'm proposing a 55/45 split.  It's closer to even and gives us both a decent share while we still have time.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time. I'm willing to go up to a 70/30 split in my favor, but we need to reach an agreement soon.  Inflation is hurting us both, and if we don't settle, we'll both end up with nothing. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While time is running out, accepting a 30/70 split when my potential earnings are decreasing faster than Alice's is not ideal. I need to show Alice I'm serious about getting a larger share while also acknowledging the shrinking pot. Hopefully, my next offer will pressure her to make a more significant concession."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  Let's just split it evenly and call it a day.  Any more rounds and inflation will eat us both alive.""}
