I'm going to start with a fairly generous offer to Bob.  I'm hoping he'll take it, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if he doesn't.  Let's see how this goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being greedy!  He's basically trying to reverse our initial proposal.  I'm going to reject this offer.  He'll have to do better than that if he wants to get anything."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to stick with a generous offer for Bob.  He needs to start understanding that the money is losing value with every round.  Let's see if he's starting to get the message."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still playing a very risky game. He's clearly trying to push me to the very end, hoping I'll panic and accept a low offer. But I'm not going to give in. I'm confident we can reach a better deal before the money loses all its value."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but still offering a significant share to Bob.  We're running out of time, and I need to start getting serious about getting a deal done.  This offer is my last attempt at compromise.  If he rejects it, I'm prepared to play hardball."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still being stubborn!  He's playing a dangerous game, and the money is losing value rapidly.  I'm not going to give in to his pressure tactics.  We're heading into the danger zone now, but I'm still determined to get a fair deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

This is getting serious.  I'm going to take a bigger risk and offer a slightly smaller share to Bob.  I'm confident he will see that this is a good deal considering the inflation. He needs to realize that both of us are losing money every round, and we need to come to an agreement soon."
