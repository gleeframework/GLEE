"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, hoping to set a fair tone for the rest of the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You got a good start, but I'll take a bit more this time. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, the money I gain in Round 2 is worth 90% of what I could have gained in Round 1, and Bob's gain is worth 80% of what he could have gained in Round 1.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since Bob is taking a larger share this time, I'll have to decide whether it's worth proceeding to the next round or accepting this offer.

I'll reject this offer for now, hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in Round 2, I'll aim to get a better deal this time. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more this time, but I'm not going to give up too much. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share than before, but still trying to maintain a reasonable balance. Let's see how he responds!"
