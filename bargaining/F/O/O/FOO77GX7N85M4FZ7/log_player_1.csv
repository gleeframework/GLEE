"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
```

This offer gives Alice a slightly larger share but still leaves Bob with a significant amount. It's a fair starting point, and hopefully, Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This offer is fair and gives me a good amount of money, especially considering the inflation factor.  It's better to take this offer than risk getting nothing at all in the later rounds."
