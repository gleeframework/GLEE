**Reasoning:**

Alice is inching closer, but it's still important to hold out a little longer. The rate of inflation is hurting me more with each round, but accepting a deal where I get significantly less isn't ideal. There's a chance Alice will offer a more agreeable split in the next round or two to avoid getting nothing."
