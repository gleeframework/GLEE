"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 30, you can't do better than that!""
}
```

I'm starting with a generous offer, but I'm not giving away too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split the money evenly, each receiving $50. It's fair and reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept an even split just yet. I'll try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Time to make a new offer!

Considering the inflation, my offer is now worth less than before, so I'll adjust accordingly:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""You can have 40, but I'm still the smart one!""
}
```

I'm still trying to get a better deal, but I'm willing to compromise a bit."
