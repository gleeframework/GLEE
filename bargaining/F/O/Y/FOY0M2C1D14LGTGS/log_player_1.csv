"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 

I propose a near-equal split, with Bob receiving a single dollar. This demonstrates my fairness while securing the vast majority of the money for myself.  Let's see if Bob is content with a very small share or wants to risk getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
 
Bob's offer is unfair, and I refuse to settle for such a paltry sum. I'll continue to fight for a more equitable division."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999990, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm willing to compromise a bit more, increasing Bob's share to $10.  I hope this shows good faith and encourages a more reasonable discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 999990 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is still unfair, and I refuse to settle for such a small share.  I believe we can find a more equitable outcome if we continue to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm proposing an even split.  It's time to put an end to this back-and-forth and simply divide the money fairly."
