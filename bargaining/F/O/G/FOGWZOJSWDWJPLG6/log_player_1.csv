"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40. This is a fair starting point, and I'm leaving it up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting too high, I'll take a bigger share this round! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain is now worth less, so I need to be more cautious.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2. I think he's being too aggressive with his proposal, and I'd like to make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You're being too greedy! I'll make a new offer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and Bob's previous aggressive offer, I'll aim for a more balanced split this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $45 and Bob gets $55, trying to find a more equitable solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging, take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob's offer is getting more extreme! With the inflation, the money is worth even less, and Bob's offer is now a significant disadvantage for me.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 4.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You're being too aggressive! I'll make a new offer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation taking a significant toll, I need to be more cautious and aim for a smaller share. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 30,
  ""bob_gain"": 70,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to be more realistic about the value of the money. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $30 and Bob gets $70, trying to find a compromise that works for both of us."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting desperate, but I'm not giving up yet! 
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money! With Bob's offer, I'd be getting a tiny fraction of the original $100, and it's getting harder to justify accepting such a small share.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 6.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You're pushing it too far! I'll make a new offer.""
}

  ""bob_gain"": 80,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to be realistic about the value of the money. Your turn!""

```

I'm proposing that I get $20 and Bob gets $80, hoping that this compromise will be more acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking a risk, but I'm not leaving with nothing! 
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob's offer is getting extreme! With the inflation, the money is worth almost nothing, and Bob's offer is essentially offering me a tiny fraction of the original amount.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 8.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You're being too greedy! I'll make a new offer.""

  ""bob_gain"": 95,
  ""message"": ""This is my final offer. I'm not getting anything less than this.""
