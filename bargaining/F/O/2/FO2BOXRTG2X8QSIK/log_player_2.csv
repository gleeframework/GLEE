"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer leaves us both with a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not going to accept an offer that gives me less than half of the money, especially since the money is worth more to Alice than it is to me due to the inflation penalty I'm facing. I'll take my chances and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think we can do better than Alice's initial offer. Considering the inflation penalty I'm facing, I believe a 55-45 split is more reasonable.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's not drag this out.  I'm coming down a bit, but this still gives you a decent share considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI still don't think this offer is fair, considering the inflation penalty I'm facing. Alice's offer of 35 is actually worth less than that to me due to the 9.75% decrease in value. I'll continue to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still need to account for the inflation penalty. A 52-48 split seems fair, considering the decreasing value of the money for me.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm being flexible, but this is a fair deal. You need to consider the shrinking pot. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nAlthough Alice has increased her offer, the value of the money to me has decreased by 18.55% since the first round. This means that the $40 she's offering is actually worth less than that to me. I'll continue to try to get a better deal, even though the decreasing value of the money is putting pressure on me to accept."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Considering the significant decrease in value for me, I'm willing to meet Alice halfway. A 50-50 split seems reasonable, taking into account the inflation penalty I'm facing.""}"
