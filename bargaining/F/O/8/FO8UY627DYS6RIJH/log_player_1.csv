"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This is a pretty standard starting offer, giving me a slight majority of the money, but not too greedy. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this new offer from Bob.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not too keen on giving up a larger share of the money, especially since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation. I'll try to do better in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","In Round 3, my offer is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, offering a 50/50 split. This way, I'm not giving up too much, but I'm also not being too greedy."
