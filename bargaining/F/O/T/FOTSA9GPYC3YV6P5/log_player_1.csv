"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer, Bob. Accept and we can split the remaining rounds.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small portion of the total, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share this round, but I'm willing to negotiate 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $200,000 is worth 90% of the original $200,000, so it's actually $180,000. Bob's gain of $800,000 is worth 80% of the original $100,000, so it's actually $80,000.

I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept this offer for now, hoping to do better in the next round.
