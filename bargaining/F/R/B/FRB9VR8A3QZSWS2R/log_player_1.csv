"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $5,000 is worth 20% less than the $8,000 I proposed in the first round, which is $4,000.

I'm not sure if Bob's gain of $5,000 is worth 10% less than his $2,000 gain in the first round, but I'll assume it is.

I'm not convinced that meeting in the middle is the best option for me, considering the inflation. I'd like to try to negotiate further.
