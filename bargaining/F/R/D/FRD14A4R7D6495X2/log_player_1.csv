"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take 60% and you take 40%""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount of money right off the bat, and we can negotiate from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small chunk, but I think I deserve more for being the one who makes the next offer 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","That's a pretty generous offer from Bob, but I'm not willing to give up too much. I'll try to negotiate a bit more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a bit too lopsided. I'd like to counter with a more balanced split.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"

  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it roughly 55/45, and we can call it a day.""
}
```

I'm trying to get a bit more than my previous offer, but still being reasonable. Your turn, Bob!"

Round 4

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is biting! Bob's offer is still quite lopsided, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of time running out.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's still too much in your favor, Bob. I'm not giving up yet!""
}
```

I'll try to hold out for a better deal, but I'm getting a bit worried about the time running out..."

I'm trying to be more aggressive and take a larger share, but I'm also willing to meet Bob halfway and split it evenly. Your turn, Bob!"
