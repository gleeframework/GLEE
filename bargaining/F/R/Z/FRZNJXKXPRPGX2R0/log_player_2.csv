"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money 70/30.  This is a generous offer for you given the inflation we're facing.  It's best to take a decent offer early, Bob! 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

It's tempting to accept, but I'm hoping for a better deal. Inflation hurts me, but I'm confident I can negotiate a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I still need a fair deal given the inflation.  Let's split it 60/40 this time. It's a good deal for both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you offering me a larger share last time, but your offer still doesn't reflect the rapid inflation we're dealing with.  Let's compromise - 65 for me, 35 for you.  This is a fair deal considering time is running out. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd like to see a better split, time is running out and the inflation is making each round worse for me. Accepting this offer is the best way to secure some gain."
