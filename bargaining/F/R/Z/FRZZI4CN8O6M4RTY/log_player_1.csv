"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering a split of $5500 for myself and $4500 for Bob, with the message ""Let's split fairly"". This is a reasonable starting point, as it gives me a slight advantage but still offers Bob a significant share. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can conclude the game quickly, minimizing the impact of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a fair split, so I propose we switch amounts from the previous round. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, although it's a straightforward swap of the amounts from the previous round, the impact of inflation means I'd be getting 10% less value out of the $4500 than I would have in the first round. Meanwhile, Bob's share is only reduced by 5%. Given this, I'd like to proceed to the next round and try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's adjust""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I'm offering $5800 for myself and $4200 for Bob, with the message ""Considering inflation, let's adjust"". Given that the value of the money decreases with each round, I'm trying to factor this into the offer while still presenting Bob with a reasonable share, hoping he'll accept before the value drops further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but the split needs to reflect the impact of inflation on both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4400 
# Bob gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer in round 4 because, despite his message about compromising and accounting for inflation, the offer doesn't sufficiently address the disproportionate impact of inflation on my share. The value of my potential gain has decreased by 27.1% since the first round, while Bob's has only decreased by 14.26%. Given this, accepting $4400, which is also subject to this significant devaluation, isn't appealing. I'll proceed to the next round, aiming to find a more balanced agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Reflecting the true cost of waiting""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I'm offering $6000 for myself and $4000 for Bob, with the message ""Reflecting the true cost of waiting"". Given the increasing impact of inflation, particularly how it disproportionately affects my potential gains, I'm adjusting my offer to reflect the urgency of reaching an agreement. By this point, the value of the money has decreased significantly, especially for me, so I'm trying to compensate for this loss in my proposal while still offering Bob a substantial amount, albeit less than in previous rounds. The message aims to convey the pressure of inflation and the benefit of accepting this offer rather than waiting further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This offer considers the inflation while still allowing us both a reasonable share.  Let's be realistic and close this deal. 
# Alice gain: 4300 
# Bob gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer in round 6 because, despite his message about being realistic and considering inflation, the offer doesn't adequately address the severe impact of inflation on my potential gains. By this point, the value of my share has decreased by nearly 41% since the first round, a significantly greater reduction than Bob's share, which has decreased by about 22.6%. Accepting $4300 under these conditions would mean I'm taking on the bulk of the loss due to inflation. Given the significant disparity in how inflation affects us, I believe there's room for a more equitable offer, so I'll proceed to the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6200, ""bob_gain"": 3800, ""message"": ""Inflation hurts me more; let's balance this""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I'm offering $6200 for myself and $3800 for Bob, with the message ""Inflation hurts me more; let's balance this"". Given that inflation continues to disproportionately affect my potential gains, I'm adjusting my offer to try and compensate for this loss. The value of the money has decreased significantly for me, by almost 41% since the first round, compared to Bob's 22.6% decrease. This offer and message aim to convey the urgency and fairness of balancing out the impact of inflation on our shares, hoping Bob will recognize the need for a more equitable division at this stage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time. This offer is more than fair considering the lost value, and it ensures we both walk away with something.  Don't let greed cloud your judgment. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer in round 8 because, despite his message about the offer being more than fair and warning against greed, it doesn't sufficiently account for the stark difference in how inflation has affected our potential gains. By this point, the value of my share has decreased by over 52% since the first round, significantly more than Bob's share, which has decreased by about 30.2%. Accepting $4200 under these conditions would mean I'm accepting a disproportionately larger loss due to inflation. Given the substantial disparity in inflation's impact on us, I believe there's still room for a more equitable offer, so I'll proceed to the next round, despite the risk of further devaluation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""Last chances for a fair deal""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I'm offering $6500 for myself and $3500 for Bob, with the message ""Last chances for a fair deal"". Given the drastic impact of inflation on my potential gains, now decreased by over 52% since the first round, compared to Bob's 30.2% decrease, I'm making a more assertive offer to try and secure a better share. The message conveys the urgency of the situation, emphasizing that we're running out of time and opportunities for a mutually acceptable agreement. I'm hoping Bob will recognize the need for a compromise that reflects the uneven effects of inflation on our shares."
