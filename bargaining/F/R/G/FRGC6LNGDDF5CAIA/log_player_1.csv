Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your share is diminishing quickly, Alice. Let's be reasonable. I'll take a slight hit to settle this now. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,

""message"": ""Bob, I understand the situation, but so do you. I'm willing to negotiate, but this needs to be more equitable.""

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's stop wasting time.  A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both benefit.  Agree now, before inflation eats away more of our potential gains. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While Bob's offer of a 50/50 split seems fair on the surface, the impact of inflation makes it heavily skewed in his favor. I need to push for a better deal while I still have some leverage."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5700,
""bob_gain"": 4300,
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate the attempt at a compromise, but a 50/50 split just doesn't work in the face of this inflation. This offer is a fair compromise, and I hope you'll consider it carefully.""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer.  Take it now, or the deal is off the table. 
# Alice gain: 5300 
# Bob gain: 4700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a tough decision, as Bob's offer is still not ideal considering the inflation disparity. However, time is running out, and the value of the money continues to decrease rapidly with each round. If I reject this offer, there's a high risk that Bob will propose an even worse deal in the following rounds, and we might end up with nothing. Accepting this offer guarantees me something, which is better than the risk of getting nothing at all."
