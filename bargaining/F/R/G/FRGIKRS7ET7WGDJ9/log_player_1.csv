Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{

  ""bob_gain"": 25,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking a more balanced approach this round, let's split the money 50/50. It's a fair and straightforward proposal. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{
