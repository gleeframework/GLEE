"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $100, and Bob can take the remaining 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 20% less, so I need to be more cautious. Since Bob's offer is 50-50, I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","With the inflation, my gain is worth 40% less than the initial $100. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to compensate for the loss of value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```"
