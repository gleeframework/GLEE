"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor. It's a fair offer considering I'm taking the risk of making the first proposal.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is worse than my initial proposal, even accounting for inflation.  I'm going to reject and see if I can do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm offering a 70/30 split in my favor. I'm willing to concede a little from my initial proposal, but I believe this is still a fair offer given the inflation we're experiencing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Although I'm getting significantly less than my initial proposal, after accounting for inflation, Bob's offer is actually better than what I'd get if I reject and propose again. It's time to take the deal."
