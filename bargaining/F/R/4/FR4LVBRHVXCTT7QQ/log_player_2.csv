"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, this is a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is feeling the pressure of inflation and reducing her demand, but it's still early in the game.  I'm aiming to secure a larger portion of the money, knowing that Alice's potential gains are diminishing with each round."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Alice, it's becoming clear the inflation is hurting your position. Let's be realistic and split the difference - 52/48.""}

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give up a bit more, but I'm not willing to go below 56% yet. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting desperate, and her offers are getting better for me. While 4400 is tempting, I think I can push my luck a bit further. The inflation is significantly devaluing her potential gains each round, and she'll have to concede more soon to avoid walking away with nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking, and your share is shrinking fast.  Take this 55/45 split before it gets even worse for you.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet in the middle, considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

It's getting risky now. While I held out for a better deal, Alice is offering an even split considering the inflation.  If I reject this and she plays rationally, I could end up with nothing in the last few rounds. It's better to secure a win now than risk losing it all."
