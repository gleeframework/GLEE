"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering to split the $10,000 evenly between us, with each of us getting $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, you can have a smaller share 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 0% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'm not too thrilled about Bob taking the majority.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and hope to negotiate a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, I'll try to negotiate a better deal for myself. Since the money is still worth the same for me, I'll try to get a bigger share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a smaller share, but I think I deserve more. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share of $3,000, while I'll take the majority of $7,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but not as big as you want 
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 0% less for me and 14.26% less for Bob, I'll have to consider whether this offer is better than my previous one.

Let me calculate the actual values:

My gain: $5,800 (initially offered $7,000, but due to inflation, it's worth less)
Bob's gain: $4,200 (initially offered $6,000, but due to inflation, it's worth less)

Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I think this offer is actually a better deal for me than my previous one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer and take $5,800."
