"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

""alice_gain"": 5250,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your proposal was unfair. Let's split it evenly. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I would have preferred my initial offer, accepting a 50/50 split now is better than risking getting even less in future rounds due to inflation."
