Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Look, Bob, I'm going to be completely fair. 50/50 split.  Take it, because it only gets worse for you! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```
While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this point is the safest option. The inflation is eating into Bob's potential gains rapidly. Waiting longer means risking an even worse deal or even getting nothing at all if the rounds run out.
