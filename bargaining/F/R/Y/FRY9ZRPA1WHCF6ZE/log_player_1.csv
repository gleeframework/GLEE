Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'll start by offering Bob a small share, hoping he'll be willing to accept in the first round.  Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer. Even though I'm getting less, it's still a fair split and I don't want to risk getting nothing if we keep going and inflation continues to eat away at the money."
