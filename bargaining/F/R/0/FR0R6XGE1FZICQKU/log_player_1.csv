I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair to start with."

I think I can do better than this."

I'll wait for a better opportunity to strike."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the continued inflation, my proposed share is worth even less than before. I'll aim for a slightly higher share to compensate for the reduced value of money. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000

# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to revert back to a 50/50 split. Considering the continued inflation, this offer is actually quite generous for me. I'll accept this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

It looks like I'll get a decent share of the money, and I don't want to risk waiting for another round."
