"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
```

This offer gives me a larger share, but still leaves Bob with something.  I'm hoping it's enough for him to accept in the first round, avoiding any inflation risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, which is fair, but I'm still hopeful I can get a slightly better deal.  The inflation is starting to take effect, but I think I can hold out for a bit longer.  I'll reject this offer and see what Bob proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8100, ""bob_gain"": 1900}
```

I'm offering a slightly lower amount for Bob this round, but still significantly more than he received in round 1.  I'm hoping that the combination of inflation and the prospect of being the proposer in the next round will encourage him to accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse for me due to inflation.  Although the 4000/6000 split is still decent, I think I can do better.  He may be trying to pressure me into accepting, but I'm still confident that I can get a more favorable outcome in the next few rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7290, ""bob_gain"": 2710}
```

I'm decreasing my offer again, but not by as much as Bob did in the last round.  I'm hoping this shows that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm also still prioritizing my own gain. I believe this offer balances both of these factors."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting because of the inflation, I still believe I can secure a larger share. His offer is increasingly favorable to him, which suggests he's becoming more desperate with each round. I'll continue to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6561, ""bob_gain"": 3439}
```

I'm decreasing my offer again, but still keeping a majority of the money.  Bob's offers are getting more favorable to him, so it's important to demonstrate that I'm still the one in control. The inflation is hurting both of us, but I'm aiming for a final deal before it becomes too severe."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly worse for me, and the inflation is significantly impacting the value of my potential earnings.  However, I'm still not convinced that this is the best I can do.  There are only a few rounds left, and I'm determined to secure a more favorable split. I'll reject this offer and hope Bob will offer a more reasonable deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5904, ""bob_gain"": 4096}
```

The inflation is really biting now, but I'm still trying to secure a majority of the money. I'm reducing my offer again, but I believe this is still a reasonable deal for Bob, considering how much the money is losing value.  I'm aiming for a final deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 86.58% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is becoming increasingly unfavorable. While inflation is significantly impacting the value of my potential earnings, I believe I can still secure a more favorable split. I'll reject this offer and see if Bob will make a more reasonable offer in the final two rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5314, ""bob_gain"": 4686}
```

We're down to the wire, and inflation is hitting hard. I'm taking a big risk here, but with only two rounds left, I need to make a move.  This offer gives Bob a slightly larger share, but it's still a significant amount of money for him. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince him to accept before we both lose everything."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 68.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 91.41% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1500 
# Bob gain: 8500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough call, but I have to accept. Inflation has drastically reduced the value of the money, and there's no chance of a better deal in the final round. Although I get a much smaller share than I initially hoped for, it's still better than getting nothing. I'm disappointed, but it's the most rational choice given the circumstances."
