"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly to start. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not accepting the offer to split it evenly in the first round. Since the money is worth 10% less for me in each subsequent round, I want to try to get a better deal. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I think I deserve a bit more. How about 60-40?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I still think a 55-45 split is fairer considering inflation affects you more. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting Alice's offer of a 55-45 split in her favor. Although she's trying to compromise, I still think I can negotiate for a better deal, especially since the money is worth less to me with each passing round. I'll wait for the next round to make another proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 57, ""alice_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle of our last offers. I think 57-43 is a fair compromise, given the inflation factor.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to go down to 53, but I'm not giving up more than that. Time is running out! 
# Bob gain: 47 
# Alice gain: 53 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI'm accepting Alice's offer of a 53-47 split in her favor. Given that the money is worth 34.39% less to me now, and considering the time pressure, I think this is the best deal I can get. If I reject this offer, the money will be worth even less to me in the next round, and I risk getting nothing if we don't reach an agreement within the 12 rounds."
