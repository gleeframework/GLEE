"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""Let's get it over with!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get all the money, and Bob gets nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less and less each round.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think I can do better than 50/50, especially considering the inflation will continue to erode the value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With inflation taking a bigger toll, I'll aim to get a larger share this round.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal this time! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a bite out of the money's value.

I'll think carefully about this offer...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the 70/30 split. It's not ideal, but I think it's a good compromise, considering the value of the money is decreasing rapidly."
