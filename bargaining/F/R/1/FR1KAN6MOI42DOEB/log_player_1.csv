"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you 10% and keep the rest.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 10% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $100,000, and keeping the remaining 90% for myself, $900,000. My message is a friendly offer to start with a fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal. Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, my gain of $900,000 in Round 1 is now equivalent to $720,000 in Round 2.

Considering Bob's offer for Round 2, I'll have a gain of $400,000, which is still a significant amount.

I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 2.
