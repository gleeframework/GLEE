"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering you 40% of the initial $100, which is $40, and I'll take the remaining 60% for myself, which is $60."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is affecting me more than Bob!

Considering the new values, I'll calculate the actual amounts:

My gain: 40% of 90% of $100 = 0.4 * 0.9 * 100 = $36
Bob's gain: 60% of 80% of $100 = 0.6 * 0.8 * 100 = $48

I'll reject this offer because I'd rather try to get more. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my new offer, taking into account the inflation:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm offering a 50-50 split, hoping to get a better deal this time."
