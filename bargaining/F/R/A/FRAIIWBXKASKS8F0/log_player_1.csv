"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of 5000 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, which is 8000 * 0.8 = 6400. Since Bob's gain is now 5000, which is worth 100% of what it was in the first round, I'll accept this offer to avoid further losses due to inflation.
