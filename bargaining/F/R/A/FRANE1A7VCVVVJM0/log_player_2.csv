Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm Bob and I'm going to see if I can get a better deal.  Let's see what Alice offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 90, ""alice_gain"": 10}
```

I'm going to propose a much more even split.  I'm confident Alice will see the benefit of accepting this offer, as it's much better than the last one she proposed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 20 
# Alice gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still not happy with the split, and I think I can get a better deal if I wait."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 80, ""alice_gain"": 20}
```

I'm sticking with a fair split, but slightly increasing my share due to the diminishing value of the money.  I believe this is the best option for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70

I'm still not happy with the split, and I think I can do better by continuing to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30}
```

I'm sticking to my principle of a fair split, but adjusting slightly to account for the increasing inflation. I'm hoping Alice will finally see reason and accept this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still not convinced this is a fair split. I'm going to hold out for a better offer.  I'm getting increasingly concerned about the rapidly declining value of the money though."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}
``` 

With inflation continuing to rise, I'm making a final attempt at a fair split.  It's becoming risky to hold out for more, but I'm still aiming for a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 83.22% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is finally a fair offer.  While I'm not thrilled with the diminishing value of the money, a 50/50 split is the best I can hope for at this point, given the escalating inflation."
