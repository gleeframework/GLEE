"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 70/30, I'll take the hit on the risk of inflation!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor, but I'm open to negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle to avoid any future disagreements. We can both walk away with a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to adjust my expectations.

I'll think about Bob's proposal... A 50/50 split is a fair offer, but I was hoping for a bit more considering the initial amount was $100.

However, I don't want to risk going into further rounds and facing even more inflation. I'll accept Bob's offer.
