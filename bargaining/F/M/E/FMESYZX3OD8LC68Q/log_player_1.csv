"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```

  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you take 40%""

# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my $6,000 gain is now worth $4,800. Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully.

I'll reject this offer since I'd rather not give up the extra $1,200 I could get if I negotiate further.
