Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think a 55/45 split is more reasonable. The money is worth less to both of us with each passing round, so let's try to come to an agreement quickly.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable and split the money evenly.  The value is decreasing for both of us, so a 50/50 split seems like the fairest solution. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
