Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

This is a classic example of the ultimatum game. I'm taking a very greedy approach here, offering Bob only $1.  I'm hoping he'll be rational and accept, as even a small amount is better than nothing. However, there's a risk he'll reject it out of spite, hoping to get more in the next round.  We'll see how it plays out!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'm still greedy, I realize I need to be more realistic.  Bob's offer is significantly better than the previous round, and the fact that he rejected my offer likely means he's willing to push for a larger share.  Taking 40% is a good outcome considering the potential for losing everything if we keep going."
