"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

This offer is a reasonable starting point. It gives Alice a slight advantage, but it's not too greedy, and it should leave room for negotiation if Bob decides to counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my initial offer. Even with inflation, my gains would be significantly less. It is still more beneficial to continue and make a counter offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm offering an even split in this round.  While the inflation has eroded some of the value, I believe a 50/50 split is the most fair and likely to be accepted.  If Bob continues to reject, the inflation will only hurt him more than it hurts me in the future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly worse, even though he's losing more value with each round.  I'm still better off rejecting and making another counter offer, as the inflation is hitting him harder."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}
```

I'm offering a slight concession to Bob, but still aiming to secure a fair share.  Inflation has impacted both of us, and I want to ensure the game doesn't drag on with constant rejections.  At this point, Bob is losing more value than me with each passing round, so he might be more inclined to accept."
