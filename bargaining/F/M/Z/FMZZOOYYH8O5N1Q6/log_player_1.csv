"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This is a pretty standard 60/40 split, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can avoid a long negotiation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting twist with the inflation!

Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 5% less, this offer is actually a better deal for me than the one I initially proposed. I'll take it!
