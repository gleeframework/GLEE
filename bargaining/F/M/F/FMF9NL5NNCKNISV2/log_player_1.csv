"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, then we can negotiate.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my $900,000 is now worth $720,000 (80% of $900,000).

Considering Bob's offer, I think I can do better than that. I'll reject his offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, my $720,000 is now worth $576,000 (80% of $720,000).

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get a decent share.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting impatient, but I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my $576,000 is now worth $280,832 (48.8% of $576,000).

Bob's offer is actually worse than the one I made in Round 3, but I'll consider it since he's willing to give me a slightly better deal. I'll accept his offer.
