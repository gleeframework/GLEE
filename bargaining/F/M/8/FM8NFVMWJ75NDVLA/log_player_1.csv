"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, it's a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving us both $5,000 each. This way, we can both get a decent amount of money and still have some room for negotiation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take the majority this time 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting the value of the money, I'll have to be more cautious. Since Bob is taking the majority, I'll have to consider whether it's worth accepting.

I'll reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, and Bob's offer was already worth 20% less than in the first round. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to counter the inflation.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a smaller share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of!""
}
```

I'm taking a larger share this time, hoping to protect my value in the face of inflation."
