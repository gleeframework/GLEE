**Reasoning:**

Alice is stubbornly sticking close to her initial split, even though the value of the money is decreasing. While her offer is slightly better, it's not enough to warrant accepting yet.  I need to show her I'm serious about getting a better deal and willing to risk letting rounds pass to do so."
