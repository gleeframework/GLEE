"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and start fresh!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but still a fair deal! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my share of 40 is now worth 32 (40 * 0.8) and Bob's share of 60 is worth 58.4 (60 * 0.968).

I'm not sure if this is the best deal for me, but it's a good opportunity to get some money. I'll accept this offer.
