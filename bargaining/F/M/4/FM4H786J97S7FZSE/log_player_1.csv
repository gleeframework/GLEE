"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives me a large portion (900,000$) while leaving a small portion (100,000$) for Bob.  I'm hoping he'll accept this offer in the first round, as the money will be worth less with each passing round.  However, I'm also aware that he could reject this offer, hoping to get a larger share in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though I'm getting 400,000 less than my initial offer, accepting this offer is the best option. The inflation means that the money I receive is worth less every round. This offer is a fair split, and refusing it might lead to a worse deal in the following rounds."
