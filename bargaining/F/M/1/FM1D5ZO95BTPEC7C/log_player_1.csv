"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. I'm taking a risk with this first offer, but I believe it's fair and gives Bob a decent starting point.  Let's see how he responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject this offer. Even with inflation, a 20/80 split is significantly worse than my initial proposal. I'll continue to negotiate for a fairer division."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor. Since inflation has reduced the value of the money, I'm willing to concede a bit, but I still believe a more equitable split is necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. Even with the inflation, a 10/90 split is extremely unfair and unacceptable.  I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}
```

I'm offering a 45/55 split in my favor.  Given the continued inflation and Bob's increasingly aggressive proposals, I'm making a significant concession to try and reach an agreement. I'm hoping this demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still advocating for a reasonable share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer.  While inflation has significantly impacted the value of the money, a 5/95 split is completely unreasonable.  I believe a fair agreement is still possible, and I'm prepared to continue negotiating."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 30, ""bob_gain"": 70}
```

I'm offering a 30/70 split in my favor.  I'm making a final concession, but I'm still committed to a reasonable outcome. This offer reflects the significant impact of inflation, but also acknowledges the need for a compromise to end the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. While the inflation has taken a significant toll, a 1/99 split is simply not acceptable.  Even though I'm running out of options, I refuse to accept such a grossly unfair deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 20, ""bob_gain"": 80}
```

I'm offering a 20/80 split in my favor. This is a difficult decision, as inflation has severely reduced the value of the money. However, I believe that this offer is the only way to secure any portion of the money at this point.  I hope that Bob will accept, as further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a more favorable outcome."
