"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, then we can reassess if needed.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60/40 is a fairer split, considering I'm taking the risk of rejection in this round. Let's see what you think. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, my gain of $4000 is worth 95% of its original value, which is $3800.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with Bob's 60/40 split, considering he's taking the risk of rejection, but I also don't want to reject again and risk another round of inflation.

I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure 60/40 is fair, but I'm willing to compromise. How about 55/45?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, my gain is worth 90.25% of its original value, which is $3620 (95% * 95% * 95% * 90.25% = 90.25%).

I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I still think 55/45 is a fair compromise.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since we're both taking risks, I think 70/30 is a more reasonable split. Let's make a deal. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, my gain of $3000 is worth 85.74% of its original value, which is $2572.20 (95% * 95% * 90.25% * 0.9265 = 85.74%).

I'm not comfortable with the 70/30 split, especially considering my gain is worth less due to inflation. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to give up that much. How about 52.5/47.5?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, my gain is worth 80.96% of its original value, which is $2720 (95% * 95% * 90.25% * 0.9265 * 0.9525 = 80.96%).

I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to find a compromise. Let's meet in the middle at 52.5/47.5, but I'll give you a slight edge.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a chance to accept, but I'm not budging on my offer. 80/20 is the final offer. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, my gain of $2000 is worth 79.38% of its original value, which is $1587.60 (95% * 95% * 90.25% * 0.9265 * 0.9525 * 0.9775 = 79.38%).

I'm not thrilled with the 80/20 split, but I'm running out of options and don't want to risk another round of inflation. I'll accept this offer.
