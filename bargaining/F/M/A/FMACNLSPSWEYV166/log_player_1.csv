"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is a relatively small amount, hoping he'll accept and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'll reassess the offer.

If I accept this offer, I'll get $4,000, which is worth 50% of the original $8,000 I offered in Round 1. Considering the inflation, this is a decent offer, but I'm not sure if I should accept it.

I'll decide to reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 10% of its original value now (due to two rounds of 5% inflation), I'll make a new offer that takes this into account. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is a relatively small amount, hoping he'll accept and we can finish the game."
