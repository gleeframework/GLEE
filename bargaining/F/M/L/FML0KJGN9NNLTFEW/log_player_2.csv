"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I take 90%, you take 10%. We can negotiate further if you'd like. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While 100,000 is a decent sum, it's worth exploring if I can get a better deal, especially considering inflation will make future offers less valuable."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is fair. It gives you a significant share while also giving me a good starting point. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it down the middle.  A 50/50 split seems like the fairest option, given the current inflation rates. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
