"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. I'm framing it as a ""fair split"" to see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering the potential for inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, Bob's offer is actually a 50-50 split in terms of the actual value of the money I gain, since his gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. However, I'll consider the nominal values he's proposing.

I'm not convinced that a 55-45 split is more fair, especially since the inflation effect is only affecting Bob's gain. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's try a 50-50 split. I'm willing to meet you halfway.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a fair and equal division of the money. I'm framing it as a compromise, hoping that Bob will accept this offer."
