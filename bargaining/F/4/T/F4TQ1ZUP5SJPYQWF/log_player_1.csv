"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a reasonable offer. Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

This way, I get 60% of the initial $10,000, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

Since the money is worth 20% less now, I'll calculate the actual amounts I'll get:

* My share: 5000 / 0.8 = 6250
* Bob's share: 5000 / 1 = 5000

Considering the reduced value of my share, I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 2.
