"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI offered Bob $4000, which is 40% of the total amount, and I'll take $6000, which is 60%. I believe this is a fair division, considering the inflation rates for both of us. Let's see what Bob thinks!\n\n###\n\nPlease respond with Bob's decision. Will he accept or reject my offer?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split, considering the inflation. Let's end this here. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI rejected Bob's offer because, despite the inflation, I believe I can get a better deal. The 5% decrease in value for me is less significant than the 20% decrease for Bob, giving me more leverage in the negotiation. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round.\n\n###\n\nLet's proceed to Round 3! I'll make a new offer to Bob.\n\n###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a more reasonable split.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease respond with Bob's decision."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a more reasonable split.""}\n\n###\n\nI've made a new offer to Bob, taking into account the inflation rates. Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Bob compared to the initial round, I believe this division is more reasonable. I'm offering Bob $4500, and I'll take $5500. Let's see if Bob accepts this offer or decides to proceed to the next round.\n\n###\n\nPlease respond with Bob's decision. Will he accept or reject my offer?"
