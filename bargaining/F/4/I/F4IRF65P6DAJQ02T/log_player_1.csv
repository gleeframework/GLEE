"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a fairly aggressive offer.  I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm willing to be fair in the future, but I want to get a good chunk of the money while it's still worth the most."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It's better to take the 50% now than risk getting nothing in the next rounds."
