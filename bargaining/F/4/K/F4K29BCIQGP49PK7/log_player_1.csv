"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this offer and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000 and leaving 40% for Bob. I think this is a reasonable split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept to end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair.  This split is more equitable.  Accept and we'll both walk away with a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation taking effect, I need to adjust my calculations.

In the second round, my gain of $450,000 is worth 95% of its original value, which is $427,500. Bob's gain of $550,000 is worth 90% of its original value, which is $495,000.

I'm not sure if I'm ready to accept a slightly lower amount than my initial offer. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure about this split. I'd like to make a counteroffer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In the third round, my gain will be worth 95% of its original value, which is 0.95 * 427,500 = $405,375.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not getting any younger!""
}
