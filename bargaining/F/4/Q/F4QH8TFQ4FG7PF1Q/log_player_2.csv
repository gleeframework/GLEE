Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's try 55-45. The money is losing value fast, don't let it slip away!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's split it evenly.  We both lose money if we keep going, and this is the fairest way to do it. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n### Assistant: Let's finish the game here. Even though the money is worth less now, an even split is a fair offer, and further rounds will only reduce the value more. Accepting this offer ensures we both get a reasonable share without additional loss due to inflation."
