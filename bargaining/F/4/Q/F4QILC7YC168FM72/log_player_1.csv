"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll give you a decent share, but I'm hoping to get the majority.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, which is 30% of the original amount, and keeping $700,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle. It's a fair deal, and we can both walk away happy. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $500,000 is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, which is $450,000. Bob's gain of $500,000 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, which is $400,000.

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, as I was hoping to get more than $450,000. But I also don't want to risk going to the next round and potentially getting less.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, my gain is worth 81% of what it was in the first round, which is $567,000. I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I still think I deserve the majority.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is 40% of the original amount, and keeping $600,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a slight loss, but I think this is the fairest offer.  Let's end this quickly, and hopefully, we both come out ahead. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $400,000 is now worth 72.9% of what it was in the first round, which is $729,000. Bob's gain of $600,000 is worth 60% of what it was in the first round, which is $600,000.

This offer is actually better for me than my previous offer, and it's a fair split. I think I should accept this offer to end the game.
