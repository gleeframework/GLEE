"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Alice's offer was 40% for her and 60% for me, I'll try to counter with a slightly more favorable offer for myself. Here's my proposal:

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting! Okay, I'll think carefully about this offer. Since Alice's offer is still 45% for her and 55% for me, I'll try to negotiate a bit more. I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal for myself.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, my offer from Round 2 was already quite generous. I'll try to get a better deal for myself now. Since the money is worth 36% less than in the first round, I'll aim for a higher percentage for myself. Here's my proposal:

{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}"
