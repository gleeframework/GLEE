"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","### Step 1: Understand the current situation and the rules of the game.
The game involves dividing $10,000 between two players, Bob (me) and Alice. Each round allows one player to propose a division, and the other player can either accept the offer, ending the game, or reject it, leading to the next round where they propose a division. The value of money decreases by 0% for me (Bob) but by 20% for Alice with each passing round.

### Step 2: Analyze Alice's previous offer and the implications of rejecting it.
Alice offered $4,000 to me and $6,000 to herself, claiming it's a fair split. However, considering the rules of the game and the devaluation of money for Alice, there might be a strategic advantage in not accepting the first offer, as the money's value for Alice decreases significantly with each round.

### Step 3: Determine a strategic offer that considers the devaluation of money for Alice.
Given that money loses 20% of its value for Alice each round, an offer that might seem less favorable to her initially could become more appealing as rounds progress and her potential gains decrease. Since I lose no value, maintaining a higher share could pressure Alice into accepting a less favorable offer due to the diminishing value of her potential gains.

### Step 4: Formulate an offer that leverages the strategic advantage identified.
Considering the strategic advantage, I'll propose an offer that slightly increases my gain from Alice's initial offer, acknowledging the devaluation of money for her but also aiming to reach a compromise that might be acceptable due to the pressure of diminishing value for her.

### Step 5: Attach a persuasive message to the offer.
The message should emphasize the strategic advantage of accepting the offer now rather than waiting for further rounds, where the value of money for Alice decreases significantly.

### Step 6: Finalize the offer and message in the required JSON format.
Based on the strategic considerations, I'll propose the following division and message:

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the devaluation, this might be the best compromise we can reach before the value drops further for you.""}

The final answer is: {""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the devaluation, this might be the best compromise we can reach before the value drops further for you.""}"
