``` 
I'm not accepting this offer. Even with inflation, 15 dollars is a very small share of the original amount.  There are still a few rounds left, and I can try to get a better deal."

Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

With only two rounds left, I'm taking a big gamble. I'm offering a very uneven split, hoping that Bob, under the pressure of the dwindling time, will accept. I'm hoping the inflation has affected him more than me.  If he rejects, we're both getting nothing, so this is a high-risk, high-reward play."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 12.5 
# Bob gain: 87.5 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting this offer. While I understand the pressure of the dwindling time, accepting this would mean losing a significant portion of what I could have gotten earlier. This is a gamble Bob is taking, and I'm not going to play along. If we both get nothing, so be it."
