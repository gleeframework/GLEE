"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a 60-40 split in my favor, with the message ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more"". This proposal gives me a slight advantage, but still offers Bob a significant share, taking into account the risk of inflation in subsequent rounds. It also sets the stage for negotiation, allowing Bob to either accept or counteroffer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn to propose a fairer split. This is a good deal before inflation eats away at the value. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI choose to reject Bob's offer of a 45-55 split in his favor. Although the offer might seem reasonable, considering the impact of inflation, accepting this proposal would mean I end up with significantly less than what I initially proposed. By rejecting, I aim to apply pressure and potentially force a more favorable offer in the next round, despite the risk of further inflation.\n\n###\n\nYour turn!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet closer to the middle.""}\n\nIn this round, I'll offer a 57-43 split in my favor, with the message ""Considering inflation, let's meet closer to the middle."" This proposal takes into account the devaluation of money due to inflation and aims to find a compromise between our previous offers. By making a slightly more favorable offer to Bob than my initial proposal, I'm trying to entice him to accept before the value of the money decreases further.\n\n###\n\nYour turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The value is decreasing fast, let's just split it evenly and call it a day. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nGiven the significant impact of inflation, which has decreased the value of the money by 48.8% since the first round, I decide to accept Bob's offer of an even 50-50 split. At this point, prolonging the game further risks reducing the value of the money even more drastically, potentially leading to a scenario where neither of us benefits substantially. Accepting this offer ensures that we both receive an equal share, albeit significantly reduced in value compared to the initial amount.\n\n###\n\nGame over!"
