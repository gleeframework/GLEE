"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, but I think I deserve more since I'm the one making the offer this round. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, I'm now worth 90% of what I was in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 80% of what it was in the first round.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not too thrilled about taking 40, especially since I think I deserve a fair share. However, I don't want to reject the offer and risk getting an even worse deal in the next round.

I'll accept the offer, but I'll make sure to make a stronger proposal next time.
