"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000 and keeping $9,000 for myself. I'm hoping Bob will accept this fair split and we can end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation factor, Bob's offer is now worth less to him than in the first round, but it's still a fair meeting-in-the-middle proposal.

I'll accept Bob's offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
