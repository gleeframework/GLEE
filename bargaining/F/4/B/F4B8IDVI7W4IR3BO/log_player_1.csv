"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the original $1,000,000, which is $400,000, and keeping 60% for myself, which is $600,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You got 60, I'll take 40. Let's make it 55-45 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my gain accordingly.

The original $1,000,000 is now worth $900,000 (10% less than the original). If I were to accept Bob's offer, I would get $495,000 (55% of $900,000).

However, since the offer is 55-45, I'll calculate my gain as 55% of the original $1,000,000, which is $550,000.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
