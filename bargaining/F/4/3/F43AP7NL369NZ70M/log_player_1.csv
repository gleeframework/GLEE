Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a generous offer, hoping to secure a quick agreement and avoid the negative impact of inflation.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer.  Even with inflation, I'm still confident I can secure a more favorable deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 810000, ""bob_gain"": 190000}
```

I'm reducing my share slightly to reflect the inflation, but still offering a significant amount to encourage Bob to accept. I believe this is a fair compromise given the circumstances."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 190000 
# Bob gain: 810000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money, accepting Bob's offer is the best option at this point.  Further rejection would likely lead to a scenario where I get an even smaller share due to the ongoing inflation."
