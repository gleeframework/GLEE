6000.0,4000.0,"Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. 60/40 seems reasonable.  We both lose money if this drags on.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Let's flip the script. I'm offering you 40% and keeping 60% for myself. This is a good deal for both of us, and it avoids further losses due to inflation.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, I appreciate the counter-offer, but it wasn't reasonable given the inflation.  Let's settle this fairly. 55/45.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
3500.0,6500.0,"I'm sticking with my previous offer, but I'm willing to compromise slightly. 65/35 is still a good deal for both of us, especially since inflation is hurting you more than me. Let's end this before we both lose too much.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5200.0,4800.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous. You're not factoring in the inflation hit we both are taking.  52/48 is my final offer.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
3000.0,7000.0,"Alice, we're both losing money with every round. It's time to be realistic. I'm offering 70/30, which is still a fair deal considering the inflation. Let's end this before we both lose everything.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Bob, this is insane.  We're both shooting ourselves in the foot. 50/50. Take it or leave it. This is your last chance.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
2500.0,7500.0,"Alice, the clock is ticking. This is my final offer: 75/25.  I'm not budging any further.  It's better for both of us to take what we can get before inflation completely wipes us out.",Bob,8,
