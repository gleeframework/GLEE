"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a chance to reconsider, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

Considering the new offer, I think I'll have to be more aggressive in my counteroffer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not giving up 80% yet!""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and hoping to get a better deal in the next round."

  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not giving up much more!""
