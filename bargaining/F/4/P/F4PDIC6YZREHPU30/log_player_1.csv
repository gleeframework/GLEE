"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I deserve a bit more, 55-45 is still a good deal for you. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Okay, Bob, let's settle this.  I'll take my previous offer down to $55, you get your $45.  Time is money, and it's losing value!""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging much, my new offer is 58-42. Time is on my side. 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly trying to exploit the inflation. It's a slow bleed, but a significant one. Accepting $42 now is a bad deal when I could have had $60 at the start.  I need to push back harder but also be aware that time is running out."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 50,
""bob_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Bob, let's stop wasting time.  A 50/50 split is fair and we both walk away with something.  Deal?""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is being incredibly stubborn. To counter this, a 50/50 split is proposed. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a reasonable outcome. It emphasizes the time pressure and the fact that continued stalling only hurts both players."
