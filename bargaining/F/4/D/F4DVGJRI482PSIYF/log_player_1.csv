"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me $6,000 and leaving $4,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering the inflation we're facing. Let's end this early! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm considering Bob's offer...

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not convinced that a 55-45 split is the best deal for me, especially since I'm not sure how much inflation is affecting Bob's perception of the value of the money. I'd like to propose another round to see if we can find a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's try to meet in the middle and split it evenly""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which I think is a fair compromise considering we've both had a chance to negotiate and adjust to the inflation."
