Alice's offer:

I'll reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round.  Inflation might help me out!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering the inflation we're facing. Let's end this early!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try to meet in the middle and split it evenly 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

Even though inflation is affecting me, a 50/50 split is a fair compromise, and I'd rather not risk getting a worse deal in the next round."
