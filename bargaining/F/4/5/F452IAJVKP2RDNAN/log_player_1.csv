Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. We both get a fair amount, and we can move on to more important things. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
