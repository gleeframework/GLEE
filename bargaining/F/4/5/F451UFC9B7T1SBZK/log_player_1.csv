"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, 80-20. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the $100, which is $80, and Bob gets 20% of the $100, which is $20."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 60, you can have 40. Your turn! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $40 is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $32.

I'm not too thrilled about this offer, but it's better than going to the next round. I'll accept Bob's offer.
