Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive offer. I want to get as much of the money as possible in the first round, knowing that the money will lose value quicker for me than for Bob.  Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, I'm willing to accept this.  The money is losing value quickly, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in the future.  A 50/50 split is fair, given the circumstances."
