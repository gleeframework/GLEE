"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a very lopsided offer.  I want to see if Bob is willing to accept anything at all in the first round, or if he'll gamble on getting a better deal later.  Let's see what happens!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a classic example of how inflation can incentivize a player to be more aggressive in negotiations.  Bob is taking advantage of the fact that the money he gains is worth less to him in each subsequent round.  I'll continue to push for a more equitable division, as I believe there's still room for negotiation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm proposing an even split.  The inflation is starting to take effect, and I want to ensure I get a fair share before it gets worse. I'm hoping Bob sees the value in a quick agreement, rather than risking getting nothing at all."
