"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10} 
```

I propose a split of 90 dollars for me and 10 dollars for Bob. This is a fair initial offer, given that the money will lose value more quickly for him in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I propose a split of 70 dollars for me and 30 dollars for Bob. This offer is fair considering the inflated value of the money, and provides a more even distribution than the previous round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While this offer is much closer to the previous one, I'm still going to reject it. Given the increasing rate of inflation, and the fact that Bob's offer barely shifted, I believe I can still get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

Given the inflation rate, I believe a 60/40 split is fair, as the value of my money is significantly less than in previous rounds. This offer gives Bob a larger share, but still reflects the loss in value for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the offer is significantly less than what I hoped for, the inflation rate is becoming very detrimental, especially for Bob.  Accepting the offer ensures that I receive something, as the next round would likely result in very little for either of us."
