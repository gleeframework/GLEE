"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think I can do better than that. I'll wait for the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}
```

This way, I'll get 42% of the remaining $1,000,000, and Bob gets 58%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is catching up!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the offer. At this point, I'd rather have 40% of the remaining money than risk waiting for another round and potentially getting even less."
