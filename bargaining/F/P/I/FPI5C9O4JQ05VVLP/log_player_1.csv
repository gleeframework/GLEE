"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle. It's a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing that we split the $1,000,000 evenly, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair, considering the inflation difference.  Let's start with this and see how we go. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not convinced that the 60/40 split is fair, considering the inflation difference. Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I think I should get a slightly larger share to compensate for the difference.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll make my own offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation difference, I'll propose a 55/45 split, which gives me a slightly larger share to compensate for the 10% less value of the money for me.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""A 55/45 split seems fair, considering the inflation difference. Let's go with this.""
}
