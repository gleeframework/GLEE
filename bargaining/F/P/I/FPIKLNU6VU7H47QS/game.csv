6000.0,4000.0,Let's be fair and split the money while it's still worth something. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,I'm not sure why you think a 60/40 split is fair.  Let's try a 60/40 split in *my* favor this time.  We'll both be better off with the money sooner rather than later.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, let's be reasonable. Your offer was heavily skewed in your favor. I'm proposing a 55/45 split.  This deal benefits us both before inflation eats away at the value.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, we're both losing money with each passing round.  Let's make a deal that benefits us both.  I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor, which is still better for both of us than continuing to haggle.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5200.0,4800.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous. You're not being realistic about the effects of inflation on your own gains.  I'm offering 52/48, my final concession. Let's close this deal before we both lose even more.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,accept
