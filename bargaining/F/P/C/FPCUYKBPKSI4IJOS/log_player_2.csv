Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting impatient 
# Bob gain: 425000 
# Alice gain: 575000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
While this offer is not ideal, accepting is the best option. Inflation is making the money worth less each round, and Alice has shown she's not willing to negotiate further. It's better to get something than nothing."
