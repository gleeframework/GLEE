"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting 600,000 and Bob getting 400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60-40 is a fairer split. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting twist!

Since the money is worth 10% less for Bob, I'll have to reassess the offer. My gain of 400,000 is still worth the same, but Bob's gain of 600,000 is worth 90% of its original value, which is 540,000.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting this offer, as I think I can do better than a 40% share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a 60-40 split, but I rejected it, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. This time, I'll offer a 55-45 split, which is closer to the 60-40 split that Bob proposed, but still slightly more favorable to me.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me halfway at 55-45. Your turn!""
}
```"
