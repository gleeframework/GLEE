"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I take the lion's share, but I'm willing to negotiate if you think it's too much. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While Alice's offer is tempting in the first round, I need to assess the long-term impact of accepting. It's likely Alice will continue to demand the larger share, and the decreasing value of money will hurt me more than her.  I'll see if I can negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair. I propose a split that benefits us both. We both get a significant portion, and we can start the game on a more even footing.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bigger share to make this worthwhile. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

Alice is still trying to get a bigger share, and while it's a more even split than her first offer, I need to hold out for something closer to 50/50.  The diminishing value of the money means I need to be more assertive in the negotiations."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's cut the drama and split this evenly.  We both get a fair share, and we can move on. Time is running out!""}
