I'm going to be greedy and start with a high offer for myself, leaving Bob with just a dollar.  Let's see if he's willing to accept such a small amount!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's better to take the 50 dollars now than risk getting nothing in the end.  Let's see if Bob's offer is the best I can get."
