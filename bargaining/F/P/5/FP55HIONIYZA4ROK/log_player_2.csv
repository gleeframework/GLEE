# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want this settled quickly. This offer is a compromise, recognizing the time pressure we both face with the shrinking pot. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're reaching a critical point. This offer is a serious attempt to find a middle ground. Take this deal, or we both risk losing out significantly. 
# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While far from ideal, the effects of inflation are becoming too significant to ignore. Accepting Alice's offer now, while not maximizing potential gains, secures a reasonable sum before further rounds erode its value.
