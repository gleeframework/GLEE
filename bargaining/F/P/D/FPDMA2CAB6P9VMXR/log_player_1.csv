Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a generous offer, giving Bob 10% of the money.  This should hopefully encourage him to accept, but I'm also keeping a significant share for myself, as the money will be worth less in each subsequent round.  Let's see what he decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer to have more, with the inflation and the limited rounds, a 50/50 split is a fair compromise.  It's better than risking getting nothing at all in the later rounds!"
