"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can split the $100 easily!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40, which is 40% of the original $100. I'll get the remaining $60, which is 60% of the original $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fair. Let's go with this and end the game! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this new offer.

Since the money is worth 5% less due to inflation, my gain of $45 in this round is equivalent to $45 / 0.95 = $47.37 in the first round. This is less than my original offer of $60.

However, I think an even split is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to accept it.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
