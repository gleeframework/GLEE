"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take 40, I'll get 60, it's a good starting point 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rate affecting my gains, I need to be more cautious. Since I'll be getting 40% of the remaining amount, I'll decide to reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation rate affecting my gains, I need to be more aggressive in my offer. I'll aim to get a larger share while Bob's share is still worth less due to inflation. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Take 40, I'll get 60, it's a better deal for me now""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take 30, I'll get 70, it's my best offer so far 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains! With the money I'd get in Round 4 being worth only 51.2% of what I'd get in Round 1, I need to be careful. However, Bob's offer is still quite generous, considering the reduced value of the money.

I'll decide to accept this offer, as it's a decent deal given the circumstances.
