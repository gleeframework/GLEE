This is a tough one, but I have to cut my losses. The value of the money is decreasing significantly for me with each round. If I reject this and go to the next round, even if I get a slightly better split, the inflation will eat into my gains.  It's better to accept a slightly less favorable offer now than risk getting even less later."
