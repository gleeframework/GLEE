"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $100, which is $40, and keeping 60% for myself, which is $60. I'm hoping Bob will accept this fair split and we can end the game early!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous last round, I'm going to try to get a better deal this time. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to get a better deal, huh?

Considering the inflation, the actual amounts I would receive in this offer are:

* My gain: 50 * 0.8 (20% less due to inflation) = 40
* Bob's gain: 50 * 0.9 (10% less due to inflation) = 45

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, considering I could have gotten 60 in the first round. But I don't want to be too greedy, either.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer that takes into account the inflation and Bob's previous offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you in the middle, but I'm not giving up more than that.""
}
```

In this offer, I'm offering Bob 45% of the remaining value of the money, which is 45 * 0.8 (20% less due to inflation) = 36, and keeping 55% for myself, which is 55 * 0.8 = 44. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can move forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not giving me enough, I want more than half. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is really taking a toll on the money!

Let's calculate the actual amounts I would receive in this offer:

* My gain: 45 * 0.512 (48.8% less due to inflation) = 23.04
* Bob's gain: 55 * 0.727 (27.1% less due to inflation) = 39.985

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, considering the significant decrease in value due to inflation. I was hoping to get more than 23 dollars. But I don't want to reject this offer without considering the bigger picture.

I'll accept this offer, hoping that Bob will be more generous in future rounds.
