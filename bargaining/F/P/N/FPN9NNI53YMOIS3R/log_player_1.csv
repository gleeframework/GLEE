"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, it's a good starting point!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial 100$ and Bob gets 40%. This is a fair and reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I'm not giving away too much yet! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

After considering Bob's offer, I'm not too thrilled about the 30% gain for myself. I was hoping for a bit more. However, I don't want to reject the offer and risk getting a worse deal later on.
