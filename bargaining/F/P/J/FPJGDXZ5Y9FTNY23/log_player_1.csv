"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. What do you say, Bob?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but still willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to negotiate a bigger share for himself.

I'll consider his offer, but I'm not sure I'm willing to give up 400,000 of the 1,000,000. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll make my own offer in Round 3!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 70-30, I'll try to counter with a slightly more aggressive offer to see if I can get a better deal. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""You took a big share last round. I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better deal this time.""
}
```

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly smaller share this time, but still want a decent chunk 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to find a sweet spot for his share. Considering the inflation, Bob's share is now worth less than in the previous rounds.

I'll think about it for a moment... Okay, I'll make a decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take Bob's offer this time, as it seems like a reasonable compromise given the circumstances."
