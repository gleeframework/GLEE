"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject this offer. While it seems fair on the surface, I know that the money will be worth less in future rounds. I want to see if I can get a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I'm going for a 60-40 split in my favor. It's a better deal for me, but still fair considering the decreasing value of the money. What do you say?""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bigger share. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share,  Alice's offer is a good compromise considering the inflation.  It's better than what I would get if we continue rejecting offers and risk getting nothing at all."
