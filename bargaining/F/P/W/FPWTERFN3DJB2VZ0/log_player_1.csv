"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10} 
```

I propose a 90/10 split, giving me the majority of the money. This is a good starting point, and hopefully, Bob will see the benefit of taking it now, rather than risking the money depreciating in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

This is a terrible offer, and I won't accept it. I'm aware of the inflation, but it's only 20% less for me in this round. There are still 10 rounds left, and I can likely get a better deal. I'll wait and see what Bob's next offer is."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm proposing a 80/20 split. While my offer is still generous, I need to be more assertive to make sure I get a fair share of the money. Since Bob rejected my previous offer, I'm going to assume that he's willing to play hardball. Hopefully, he'll see the value in accepting this offer before the inflation eats away at the value of the money further."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is getting ridiculous. Bob's offer is incredibly low, even though the money is worth less for me.  I'm not going to give in to his pressure tactics, and I'm confident I can do better.  Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm sticking with a fairly high offer, but I'm reducing my share to 70%.  This is a strong compromise, acknowledging the inflation, but still giving me a significant portion of the money. I'm betting that Bob will see the value in this deal before it's too late and the money becomes worthless."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2 
# Bob gain: 98 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse and worse, but I'm still going to reject it. The inflation is hurting me, but I'm not going to be bullied into accepting such a low offer.  There are still a few rounds left, and I'm going to keep fighting for a fair deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

This is my final offer, and it's a big concession on my part. The inflation is taking its toll, but I'm still trying to be reasonable. I'm going to keep my share at 60%, hoping that Bob realizes that we're running out of time and the money is becoming worthless. I'm willing to accept a smaller share, but I'm not going to be bullied into accepting a deal that's completely unfair."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is outrageous! Bob's offer is practically nothing, and he's taking advantage of the inflation to try and steal the money.  I'm not going to accept this. I'm going to keep fighting for a fair deal, even though the value of the money is dwindling rapidly. I'm not giving up yet."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

With only four rounds left, the value of the money is getting very low for me, and I'm starting to feel the pressure. I'm making a final compromise and proposing a 50/50 split.  I'm hoping Bob recognizes the urgency of the situation and sees the value in accepting this offer before we both end up with nothing."
