"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good deal! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Your turn Alice. I'm feeling generous, but let's not forget time is money. This offer is better for you than the last.""}
```
Here's why this offer makes sense:

* **Accounting for Inflation:**  Bob loses 20% of the value each round. Accepting 4000 in Round 2 is equivalent to accepting 3200 in Round 1 (4000 * 0.8 = 3200).  He needs to aim higher to make up for this.
* **Fairness:** While a 50/50 split seems fair, Bob's time-sensitive loss justifies a slight advantage in his favor.
* **Urgency:** The message subtly reminds Alice that delaying benefits her but hurts Bob. This encourages a quicker agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on Bob, don't be greedy! This is a good compromise. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to wear Bob down, but he needs to hold firm. Here's why:

* **Unfavorable Trend:** Alice's offers are getting worse for Bob. Accepting 4200 in Round 3 is like accepting 2688 in Round 1 (4200 * 0.64 = 2688).
* **Leverage:** Alice wants the deal done. As time passes, the pressure is on her to avoid Bob proposing a very small amount in a later round. 

Bob needs to show Alice he's serious about getting a fair deal that accounts for the shrinking value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5600,
""alice_gain"": 4400,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic.  The value decreases for me each round. This offer is fair considering the time pressure.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increased Demand:**  Bob needs to increase his demand to compensate for the decreasing value of the money. 
* **Deadline Pressure:**  With each round, Alice is risking a worse offer if Bob gets to propose in the later rounds.
* **Justification:**  Framing the offer as ""realistic"" and ""fair"" might make Alice more receptive. Bob is acknowledging the time pressure, but also standing firm on the impact it has on his potential gains."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, Bob. This is my best offer yet. 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision, but time is running out. Here's why accepting is now the best option:

* **Diminishing Returns:** Accepting 3800 in Round 5 is equivalent to about 2316 in Round 1 (3800 * 0.61 ~ 2316). This is far from ideal, but...
* **Final Round Risk:** If Bob rejects this, he gets to propose in Round 6, but the value will have dropped even further. There's a real chance he'd have to offer Alice a large sum to get any agreement at all, potentially leaving him with even less than this offer.
* **Alice's Strategy:** Alice has likely realized the time pressure is working in her favor and might not budge much from this offer. 

While not ideal, accepting avoids the risk of getting an even worse outcome in the final round."
