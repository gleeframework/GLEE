4000.0,6000.0,"I think a 60/40 split is fairer. It acknowledges your initial proposal, but also gives me a more reasonable share. Let's see if we can make this work.",Bob,2,

7000.0,3000.0,"I'm willing to compromise. I'll take 70% and you can have 30%. We need to move towards an agreement quickly, otherwise, the value of the money will keep decreasing for me.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
5000.0,5000.0,Let's split the money equally.  This way we both get a fair share and avoid the further devaluation of the money due to inflation. It's a win-win situation.,Bob,4,
