Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a significant portion of the money. Let's be practical and find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 600000 
# Alice gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to a more reasonable split, time is working against me more than her.  It's still worthwhile to hold out for a better deal."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 650000,

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's split it down the middle. This is a fair and equal offer. We both get a reasonable share, and we avoid further risk with inflation. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, a 50/50 split is the most reasonable outcome we can hope for at this point.  The effects of inflation are becoming significant, and further rounds heavily favor Alice. Accepting now guarantees a reasonable payout."
