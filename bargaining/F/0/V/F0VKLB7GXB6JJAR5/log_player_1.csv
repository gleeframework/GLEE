I'm going for a large share in the first round, aiming for a 90/10 split.  While I don't know how inflation affects Bob, I'm hoping the potential of losing more money in future rounds will motivate him to accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, it's better to take the 50/50 split now.  The inflation will only continue to decrease Bob's potential gains in future rounds, making him more likely to hold firm on this offer. It's a fair deal that secures me a significant portion of the money."
