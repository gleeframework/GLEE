"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split, keeping the lion's share for myself and offering Bob a small percentage. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince him to accept the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer.  While it's better than the last round,  it's still not a fair split. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to accept such a small amount.  I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to propose a 60/40 split. This is still more favorable to me, but it shows that I'm willing to compromise.  I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to accept the deal and avoid further rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept this offer. While it's still not ideal, the inflation is hitting hard and this is the best deal I've been offered so far.  I'm willing to take the 450,000 and move on."
