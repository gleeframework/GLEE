"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40 to start, we can adjust in future rounds""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40, which is a relatively small amount to see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a 50-50 split this time 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less, my gain in this round is $50 * 0.95 = $47.50.

I'll accept Bob's offer for a 50-50 split. 

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
