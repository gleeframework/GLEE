"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'll start by offering a 90/10 split in my favor. I figure it's a reasonable starting point, leaving a good chunk for Bob while still giving me a significant advantage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While a 50/50 split isn't ideal, the inflation is a big factor. Accepting now means I still get a decent share, and it avoids the risk of getting nothing in later rounds."
