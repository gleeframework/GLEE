Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

I'm offering you $2,000, and I'll take $8,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the $8,000 I was initially offering is now worth $7,200, and the $2,000 I was offering to Bob is now worth $1,800.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now. I'm hoping to do better than this.
