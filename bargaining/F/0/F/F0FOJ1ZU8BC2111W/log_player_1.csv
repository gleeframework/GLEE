"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept this and we can move on.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split, with me getting $8,000 and Bob getting $2,000. I'm trying to be generous to see if Bob will accept and we can end the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, Alice. I'll take a bigger share this time. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'm not as eager to give away as much as I was in the first round.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now and try to negotiate a better deal for myself.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher share for myself this time. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not going to give away too much, Bob. This is a fair compromise.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to think you're not serious about dividing the money fairly, Alice. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to drive a hard bargain. With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal. But I don't want to give up too much either.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now, as it's a 50:50 split, which is more reasonable than my previous offers. Maybe Bob will be more willing to negotiate in future rounds.
