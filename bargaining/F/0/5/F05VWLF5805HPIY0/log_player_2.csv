Round 3

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time, the inflation is affecting both of us. It's a fair deal. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nAlthough the offer seems fair at first glance, considering the inflation, I think I can still get a better deal in the next round. The money is worth less for both of us, but it's affecting Alice more. I'll try to use this to my advantage."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation is hitting you harder, I think this is a reasonable adjustment. It's still a good deal for you.""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try to find a compromise. I'm willing to move a bit closer to your offer, but I need to secure a decent share to make this worthwhile. 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nGiven the current state of inflation and its impact on both our gains, I believe this offer is reasonable and fair. The difference between our last offers was not significantly far apart, indicating we were both converging on a similar division. Accepting this offer ensures I receive a substantial amount, considering the devaluing of the money over the rounds. Continuing might risk further devaluation without a guarantee of a significantly better offer."
