"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can negotiate from here""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split, with me getting $80 and Bob getting $20. The message is an attempt to set a fair starting point and open the door for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  It's the fairest way to start. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less in Round 2, my gain of $50 is actually worth $40.

I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
