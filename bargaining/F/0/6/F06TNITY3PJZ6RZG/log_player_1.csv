"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate!""
}
```

This way, we both get $5,000 each, and we can end the game if Bob accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent share, but I'm not going to give you all the money! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not going to accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to make a counteroffer, considering that the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round (5% less than the previous round), I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal this time, but I'm not getting any younger!""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
