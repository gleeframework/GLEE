Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

Let's see if Bob is greedy or reasonable.  I'm offering him a small slice, but it's better than nothing.  Let's see how this goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

While I would have preferred to get more, I realize that with inflation, I'm getting less with each round. Accepting this offer is the best option to secure some money, even if it's less than I initially wanted."
