"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  This seems like a fair starting point, given the potential for inflation to affect the value of the money more for Bob.  Let's see what he thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, the value of the money is declining faster for me than Bob. Accepting this offer ensures I receive a decent amount while mitigating the impact of further inflation."
