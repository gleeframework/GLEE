"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take 80% and you'll get 20%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split in favor of me, Alice. What do you think, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous in round 1, I'll take most of the pie this time! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks I was too generous, huh?

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. With the money I gain in this round, I'll have $100,000, which is still a significant amount. But Bob's gain is a whopping $900,000, which is 90% of the total!

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this offer. I'll have to reject it and try to negotiate further.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money I have left, I'll try to make a more balanced offer. Since Bob's gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll aim for a more even split.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground, I'll take 60% and you'll get 40%""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'll take a bigger share now! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of me!

With the money I gain in this round, I'll have $300,000, which is a decent amount, but I'm not sure it's worth it considering the huge difference in our gains. The inflation is really working against me now, and Bob's gain is worth significantly less than it was in the first round.

However, I don't want to give up too much more. I'll have to think carefully about this offer...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to counter Bob's previous one. Since I'm not getting any younger, I'll take a bigger share this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting any younger, I'll take 70% and you'll get 30%""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting greedy, I'll take most of what's left! 
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to squeeze the last bit of value out of the deal!

With the money I gain in this round, I'll have $150,000, which is a small amount, but I'm not sure it's worth the huge difference in our gains. The inflation is really eating away at the value of the money now, and Bob's gain is worth a tiny fraction of what it was in the first round.

However, I don't want to leave the table with nothing, so I'll have to think carefully about this offer...
