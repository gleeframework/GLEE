Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm starting with a proposal that gives me a large share, as I'm hoping Bob will be eager to accept in the first round to avoid any potential inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, the inflation is a significant factor.  Since Bob's offer is only 30% less than my original proposal, and the money is effectively worth more to me, I'll accept."
