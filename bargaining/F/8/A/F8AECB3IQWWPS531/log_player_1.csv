Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. I understand the inflation is hitting you harder, but my offer is fair for both of us in the long run. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer. The inflation is starting to become a significant factor for you. It's in your best interest to accept this mutually beneficial deal. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

**Reasoning:** Bob is playing hardball, but time is working in his favor. However, accepting 450,000 is a terrible deal for Alice when even with the round 5 depreciation, she can still offer Bob more than 550,000 and get a better deal. Bob knows he's pushing it, which is why he is calling it his final offer. Let's see if he budges in round 5."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 555000,
""bob_gain"": 445000,
""message"": ""Bob, it's clear we both want this settled. This is my final offer. It's more than fair considering the time pressure caused by the inflation.  Let's close the deal.""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Strategic Counter:** Bob called a bluff with his ""final offer.""  Alice needs to signal firmness now.
* **Time Sensitivity:**  While Alice will lose more to inflation in the next round, she needs to show Bob she's willing to go there.
* **Slight Edge:**  Offering 445,000 to Bob is slightly better than his previous offer, making it tempting for him to avoid further risk."
