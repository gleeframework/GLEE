Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair to take a slightly larger share since I'm taking on the risk of rejection. This ensures a faster resolution, and we can both still walk away with a significant amount. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000
