"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you 400k and take 600k. It's a good starting point.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60/40 is a fairer split, with me getting the larger share. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to trick me with the same offer as before! I'm not falling for it.

```

```

I'm going to reject this offer and wait for a new proposal from Bob."

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I still think 55/45 is a fair split. What do you think, Bob?""
}
```

I'm adjusting the split to 55-45 in my favor, but still leaving you with a decent amount. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to offer you 300k, but I need at least 700k to make it worthwhile for me.  The money is losing value with each round, so we need to act quickly. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to pressure me with a lower offer. I'm not convinced it's the best deal, especially considering the value of money is decreasing.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

I'll reject this offer and wait for a new proposal from Bob. I'm hoping he'll come up with something better."
