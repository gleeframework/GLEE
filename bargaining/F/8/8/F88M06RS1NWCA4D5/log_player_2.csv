Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to take a smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise given the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though the offer is significantly less than I initially hoped for, the inflation is making the value of the money decrease significantly. Accepting this offer means I'll still get something, rather than risking getting nothing if I keep rejecting and the inflation continues."
