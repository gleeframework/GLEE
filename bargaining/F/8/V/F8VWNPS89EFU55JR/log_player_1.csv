"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000. My message to Bob is to start with a fair split and see where the negotiations go from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a good starting point for further negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my $600,000 from the first round is now worth $570,000 (95% of $600,000), and Bob's $400,000 is now worth $320,000 (80% of $400,000).

Bob's offer in the second round is $300,000 for me and $700,000 for him, which is a significant decrease from the first round. Considering the inflation, I think I should hold out for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Since Bob's offer in the second round was $300,000, which is 75% of the original $400,000, I'll aim to get a similar percentage of the remaining amount.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42-58 split, with me getting $420,000 and Bob getting $580,000. My message to Bob is that I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation is affecting me more than you. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation:

My original $600,000 from the first round is now worth $513,000 (85.5% of $600,000), and Bob's $400,000 is now worth $208,000 (52% of $400,000).

Bob's offer in the fourth round is $450,000 for me and $550,000 for him, which is a slight improvement from his previous offer. However, considering the inflation, I think I should hold out for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 14.26% less due to inflation, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Since Bob's offer in the fourth round was $450,000, which is 87.5% of the original $512,500 (since $450,000 is 87.5% of $512,500), I'll aim to get a similar percentage of the remaining amount.

However, I'll aim to get a better deal this time, considering Bob's previous offers were not satisfactory. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet at the midpoint and see if we can find a better deal from there.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, with me getting $500,000 and Bob getting $500,000. My message to Bob is that I'm willing to meet at the midpoint and see if we can find a better deal from there."
