"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose a 900,000 - 100,000 split in my favor. I want to secure a large portion of the money while leaving Bob with a decent share. It's a fair starting point, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 720000, ""bob_gain"": 280000}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to account for the inflation, aiming for a 720,000 - 280,000 split. While I still want a significant share, I'm willing to give up some more to reach an agreement before the value of the money depreciates further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 280000 
# Bob gain: 720000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
Even though I'm losing a significant amount of money due to inflation, I'm better off taking this offer than risking getting nothing.  It's a much better split for Bob than my last proposal, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in the next round."
