Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55/45 split in my favor.  This ensures a fairer distribution and gives us both a solid share before inflation takes its toll. Let's agree and move on. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{
