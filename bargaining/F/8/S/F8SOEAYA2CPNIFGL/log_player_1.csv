"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
```

This offer is designed to secure a quick agreement in the first round. It's likely that Bob will accept this offer, as it's still a significant gain for him. However, as Alice, I want to maximize my share while ensuring a deal is reached quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

While it's tempting to accept this offer since I'm losing money with each round, I'm confident that Bob will eventually offer me a more favorable split. The inflation is hitting me harder, but it's likely affecting Bob as well."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000} 
```

I'm lowering my share to 8000, but keeping a substantial portion for myself. With each passing round, Bob's perceived value of the money is also decreasing.  I'm hoping to get a deal done before the inflation significantly impacts both of us."
