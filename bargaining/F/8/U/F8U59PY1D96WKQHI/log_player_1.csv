"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
```

I'm starting with a generous offer, hoping to secure a quick agreement.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much more even, but I'm still confident I can get a better deal.  I'll see if I can negotiate a higher share in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000} 
```

I'm offering a compromise - a bit less than my first offer, but still a significant share.  I'm hoping Bob recognizes that with each round, the value of the money decreases, and he'll accept this deal to avoid further losses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting this offer. Even though inflation has significantly decreased the value of the money, Bob's offer is better than what I would have gotten if I rejected and went to the next round. I would likely get a much lower share. It's time to end the game and secure a decent outcome."
