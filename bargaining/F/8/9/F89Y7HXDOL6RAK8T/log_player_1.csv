"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives me the vast majority of the money ($900,000), while giving Bob a smaller share ($100,000).  I'm trying to maximize my gains in the first round, knowing that the money will be worth less in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly less favorable to me than my initial proposal. While the value of the money has decreased due to inflation, it's still not worth accepting a much smaller share. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share than my initial proposal, but still giving him a significant amount.  I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob, considering the value of money is decreasing with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the value of the money has decreased considerably, Bob's offer is now more favorable to me.  I'm getting a much larger share than in his previous offer, and the remaining rounds will continue to reduce the value of the money. It's time to accept and secure a decent amount."
