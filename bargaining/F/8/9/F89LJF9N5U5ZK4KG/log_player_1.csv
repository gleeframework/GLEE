"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

I'm starting with a pretty generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept in the first round.  It's a good starting point, but I'll be willing to negotiate if he rejects it.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse for me than my initial offer was for him, even with inflation. I'm not going to accept that. I'll make a counter offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm reducing my share by another $1000, but still offering a significant amount to Bob.  Since he rejected my generous offer in the first round, I'm making it clear that I'm not going to accept a drastically unfair deal in his favor.  This offer still gives him a decent share, and if he wants more, he'll have to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse with each round, and he's not showing any willingness to compromise.  I'm sticking to my strategy of offering a fair share and waiting for him to come down. He'll need to do more than offer me a small amount to get me to agree at this point."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm continuing to reduce my share, but I'm still offering a significant amount to Bob. I'm hoping that by demonstrating a willingness to compromise, I can get him to consider accepting a deal before we run out of time and the inflation hits us even harder."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still not fair. I'm not willing to accept such a small share, especially with the significant inflation we're facing.  I'm hoping he realizes he's getting a good deal with my offers and will come to a compromise."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm reducing my share again, hoping that Bob will finally understand the need to compromise.  We're getting closer to the end, and the inflation is getting worse, so he needs to start taking this seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob is increasing his share a bit, it's still far too unfair for me to accept. We are running out of rounds, and the inflation is becoming a huge factor, but I refuse to accept a deal where I receive less than half the money. I will keep making fair offers, and hopefully, he will realize it's better to get something than nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

With only a few rounds left, I'm proposing a 50/50 split. This is the fairest option considering the inflation, and it's the only way we can both get something.  I'm hoping Bob sees reason and accepts this offer. If he doesn't, we are both likely to get nothing."
