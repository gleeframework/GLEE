Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a very high offer for myself, knowing that the money will lose value each round. I'll see if Bob accepts this early on, but I'm prepared to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I'm not going to let him get away with it! I'll reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm lowering my demand slightly, but I'm still aiming for a larger share.  It's risky, but I'm hoping Bob sees the value in getting something rather than risking losing everything in the later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting more and more lopsided. I'm still holding out for a better deal, hoping that the pressure of dwindling rounds will make him more reasonable."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

The pressure is mounting, so I'm going for a 50/50 split.  This feels like a fair deal considering the inflation.  I'm hoping Bob will see that we're both losing money with every passing round, and he'll accept this offer."
