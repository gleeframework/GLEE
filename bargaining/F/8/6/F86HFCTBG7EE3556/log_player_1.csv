Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going for a  fairly aggressive offer in the first round, aiming to secure a significant portion of the money.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
I reject this offer. Bob's proposal is unreasonable, even with the inflation taken into account.  I will counter with a more equitable offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000} 
```

I'm adjusting my offer based on the inflation and Bob's previous proposal. I'm aiming for a significant portion of the money while still offering Bob a reasonable share.  Let's see how he responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

While Bob's offer is slightly better than his previous proposal, it's still not a fair deal. I believe I can secure a more favorable outcome by continuing the negotiations."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000} 
```

Considering the significant inflation, I propose a 50/50 split. This is a fair compromise, acknowledging both the value lost due to inflation and the potential for further negotiations. I hope Bob will recognize the value of this equitable distribution and accept the offer."
