"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 3000, and we can discuss further if you want.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 3000, which is a relatively small amount, to see how he responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a fair split, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share this time. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual amounts I would gain are:

* My gain: $5000 * 0.8 = $4000
* Bob's gain: $5000 * 0.8 = $4000

Since we're at a 50-50 split, I'll accept this offer.
