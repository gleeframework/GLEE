"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
``` 

I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. This is a fair starting point, considering I'll be losing 5% of my money with each passing round while Bob loses 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
It's in my best interest to accept this offer. Although I get less than my initial proposal, the inflation rate will make each subsequent round less favorable for me. A 50/50 split is a fair outcome."
