"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 20% now.""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial 100$, which is $20, and keeping 80% for myself, which is $80. I'm framing it as a fair split to see if Bob will accept or propose a different split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more balanced split would be better. I'm willing to take a bit less now, but let's aim for a more equitable outcome. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of $45 is now worth 90% of its original value, which is $40.50, and Bob's gain of $55 is worth 95% of its original value, which is $52.25.

Considering the inflation adjustment and Bob's message, I think his offer is a reasonable compromise. I'll accept his offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
