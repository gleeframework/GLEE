"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 

Alice is feeling greedy and decides to take almost everything, leaving just $1 for Bob. This is a risky strategy, as Bob could easily reject the offer and get a much better deal in the next round.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
 
While it would be nice to get more, it is highly likely that Bob will reject any offer that gives Alice more than $100,000 in the next round. Accepting this offer ensures Alice gets something, and the risk of losing everything to inflation is too high."
