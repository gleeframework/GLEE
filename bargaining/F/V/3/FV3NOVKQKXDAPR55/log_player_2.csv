Alice's offer:

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering a compromise. It's a significant amount for both of us, and time is running out.  Don't let inflation erode our potential gains any further. 
# Bob gain: 375000 
# Alice gain: 625000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is steadily increasing her pressure, but her offers are getting worse for me.  I need to hold firm and demonstrate I'm willing to risk it all to get a fairer share. It's a risky game, but with 8 rounds left, I have some leverage."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 525000,
""alice_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm holding firm. This is a reasonable offer considering the time pressure we both face. Let's settle this now and avoid further losses from inflation.""} 

**Reasoning:**

I'm slightly decreasing my demand to show flexibility but staying firm on getting a larger share. This keeps the pressure on Alice and acknowledges the shrinking pot due to inflation.  I'm hoping she sees this as a fair compromise before the devaluation becomes too significant."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Take this offer or I'll be forced to go even lower. Don't let your stubbornness cost you everything. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is bluffing. Her tone is getting aggressive, but she's still taking the majority.  My offers are fair, and she knows it.  Calling her bluff here is crucial to turning the tide in the negotiations. I'm willing to gamble a little more as time is running out, but I believe I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the only fair solution here.  Take it before inflation eats away at our potential gains any further. This offer is non-negotiable.""}

**Reasoning:**

It's time to go on the offensive and present a firm front. Offering a 50/50 split is strategically smart: 

* **Fairness:** It eliminates arguments about fairness and puts the pressure back on Alice.
* **Urgency:** Highlighting the shrinking pot due to inflation adds time pressure.
* **Finality:**  Declaring it ""non-negotiable"" signals I'm serious and willing to walk away if necessary.

Alice might be stubborn, but this approach increases the chance of her accepting a deal rather than risking everything on getting a larger share."
