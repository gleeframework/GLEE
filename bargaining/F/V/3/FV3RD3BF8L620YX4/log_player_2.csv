Let's see if we can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I think a more balanced split is better in the long run, considering the inflation.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet in the middle of our previous offers. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd like a larger share, accepting this offer is the most logical choice. The inflation is making every round riskier, and it's likely we won't get a better deal in the next round."
