"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I propose to keep 90% of the money and give Bob 10%. This gives me the majority of the money, but allows Bob to see that I'm willing to share, which might make him more likely to accept an offer in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, it's better to take the offer now than risk getting nothing in the later rounds due to inflation."
