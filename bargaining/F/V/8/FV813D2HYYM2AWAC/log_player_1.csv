"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

I propose to take 999,000 dollars and let Bob have 1,000.  I want to maximize my share right away, and the inflation should only slightly affect me in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get more, with the 5% inflation, I'm likely to get even less if I reject and make a proposal. 500,000 is a fair split, considering the circumstances."
