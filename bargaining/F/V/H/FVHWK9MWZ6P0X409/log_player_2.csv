"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. I'm offering you 4500, which is more than you'd get in your proposed split after another round of inflation.  Take the deal now while it's still good! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

I'm still hoping for a better deal. Even with inflation, I believe I can get more than 4500."
