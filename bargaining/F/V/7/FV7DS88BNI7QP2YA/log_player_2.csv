"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. Your turn! 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice's offer is not fair, and there are many rounds left. I'll try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering we have many rounds left. What do you think?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Your turn! 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer more, the inflation is hitting me hard. Accepting this offer secures a decent amount, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in the future."
