"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Take it or leave it, Bob.  This is my first offer and the money is worth a lot more to me than it is to you.  I'm being generous here. 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but that offer is simply unacceptable.  Let's be reasonable. This offer still gives you a significant share.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a much larger share. This offer is my final concession.  If you reject it, we both risk getting nothing. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing tough, but she's clearly aware of the inflation working against me. While her offer is better, accepting now would still leave me with a tiny fraction of the pot.  It's a risk, but I need to push for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, 
""alice_gain"": 450000, 
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  My offer is more than fair, and it's clear you're trying to exploit the inflation.  Let's be realistic - accept this offer, or we both risk walking away with nothing.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close to the end here.  This is my final offer.  If you reject it, we both risk losing everything.  Let's be reasonable. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting desperate, but her ""final offer"" is still unacceptable.  She's clearly trying to scare me into taking a bad deal.  I'm willing to risk it â€“ if she's truly reasonable, she'll make a much better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 400000, 
""alice_gain"": 600000, 
""message"": ""Alice, it's time to be serious.  We're both risking a lot here. My last offer was more than fair. This is my final offer.  Take it or leave it.""}"
