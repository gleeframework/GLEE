"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise.  Let's split it 55/45. This still leaves me with a decent share after inflation, and gives you a better deal than the last offer. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000
