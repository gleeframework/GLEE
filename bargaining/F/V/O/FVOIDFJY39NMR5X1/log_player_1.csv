"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose Alice takes $900,000 and Bob takes $100,000. This way, I get a good chunk of the money, but still leave Bob with a decent amount to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000} 
```

I'm going to try a more balanced approach this time.  Since the money is losing value quickly, I'll offer Bob a larger share than before.  He might be more likely to accept this, as he knows his next offer will be even lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is pretty generous, considering the value of the money has dropped significantly.  I'm taking it."
