40.0,60.0,"I think we can do better than that. Let's be fair, but also keep in mind the inflation. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor, as I'll be losing more value with each round.",Bob,2,

45.0,55.0,"I understand your concern about the inflation, Alice. However, I'm still losing more value than you with each round. Let's meet in the middle with a 55/45 split in my favor. This should be fair considering the inflation and allow us to end the game soon.",Bob,4,
,,"I'm not ready to give up that much. I'll make a new offer, but it's going to be tough. How about 52/48 in my favor?",Alice,4,reject
