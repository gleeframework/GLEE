Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than that. Let's be fair, but also keep in mind the inflation. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor, as I'll be losing more value with each round. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation taking a bigger hit on my side, I'm not eager to accept a 40% share. I'll try to negotiate further. Here's my response:
