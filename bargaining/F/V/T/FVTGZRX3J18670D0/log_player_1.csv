"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. The message is a friendly one, suggesting a fair and reasonable starting point for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share this time, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I need to reassess the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I reject Bob's offer because, considering the reduced value of money, I'd rather wait for a better proposal. The 3000 I would gain is not enough to compensate for the reduced purchasing power due to inflation. I'd like to see a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's split it 45-55!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45-55 split in favor of Bob, with me getting $4,500 and Bob getting $5,500. The message is a friendly one, suggesting a compromise and meeting in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly larger share this time, but I'm not getting taken advantage of! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the significant reduction in value of money due to inflation, I need to carefully consider Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I accept Bob's offer. The reduced value of money makes the numbers smaller, but I'd rather have $4,000 now than risk waiting for a potentially better offer in the future, considering the accelerated inflation."
