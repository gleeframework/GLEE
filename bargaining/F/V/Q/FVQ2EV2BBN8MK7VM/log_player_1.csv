Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 10% decrease in value, but I'll consider Bob's offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm going to reject this offer because I feel it's still not fair. I was hoping for a more even split, and this proposal gives me only 40% of the total amount. I'll wait for the next round to make a new proposal."
