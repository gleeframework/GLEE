"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 400k, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since Bob is offering me $400,000, but the money is worth 5% less due to inflation, that's equivalent to $380,000 in the original amount. That's a decent offer, but I was hoping for a bit more.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $380,000 in the previous round, I'll aim a bit higher this time. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, I'll give you a bit more than 50%""
}
```

This offer is slightly more generous than my initial 50/50 proposal, but still leaves room for negotiation. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 300k, but I think I deserve more, considering the value of money has decreased 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this new offer. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to consider the value in the original amount. $300,000 in the current round is equivalent to $271,428 in the original amount.

While this is a decent offer, I was hoping for more, considering the value of the money has decreased. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $271,428 in the original amount, I'll aim a bit higher this time. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 375000,
  ""bob_gain"": 625000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not willing to give up too much""
}
```

This offer is a bit more generous than my previous one, but still leaves room for Bob to negotiate. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 200k, but I think I deserve more, considering the value of money has decreased significantly 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this new offer. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to consider the value in the original amount. $200,000 in the current round is equivalent to $159,384 in the original amount.

This offer is significantly lower than my previous one, and I'm not sure if I'm willing to accept it. However, I don't want to risk going to another round and potentially getting an even worse offer.

I'll accept this offer, hoping that I'm making the best decision given the circumstances.
