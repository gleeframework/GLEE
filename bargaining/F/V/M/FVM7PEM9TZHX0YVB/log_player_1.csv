"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and let's split the money fairly!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $700,000 and Bob gets $300,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You offered 70% to yourself, now it's my turn to offer a fair deal! 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $600,000 is worth 90% of $600,000, which is $540,000. Bob's gain of $400,000 is worth 95% of $400,000, which is $380,000.

I'll reject this offer because it's not as generous as my original offer, and I'd like to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the next round of inflation, my gain of $540,000 is worth 90% of $540,000, which is $486,000. I'll make a new offer to Bob.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me halfway, Bob! Let's make a deal!""
