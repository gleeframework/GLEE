Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable and split it down the middle. A 50/50 split is the fairest option for both of us.  It's time to move towards a solution. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This seems like the most logical outcome.  Alice has been slowly increasing her offer and a 50/50 split is fair.  Holding out for more might result in getting nothing."
