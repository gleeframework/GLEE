"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a proposal that favors me slightly, but leaves a decent share for Bob. I'm hoping he'll accept this in the first round to avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, accepting this offer ensures I get something. With inflation, the value of my potential gains in future rounds will decrease significantly, making this a safer bet."
