"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Let's be fair, Bob. This offer leaves us both with a good amount.""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split. We both get a good amount, and it leaves room for us to potentially negotiate in the future if we both feel it's necessary. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a tough spot. Bob's offer is the same as mine, just reversed, and it's not getting better with time for me. However, getting only $40 is a significant loss. Let's see if I can get him to move a little.
