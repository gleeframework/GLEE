"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and you get 10%. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While 1000$ is something, it's a very small portion.  It's worth trying to negotiate for a better deal, especially since inflation will make the money worth less in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split the money evenly. This way, we both get a good share, and we don't have to worry about inflation eating away at our gains.""}
