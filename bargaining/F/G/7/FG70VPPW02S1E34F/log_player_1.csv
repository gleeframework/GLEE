"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'm happy to take a bit less to avoid any risk of losing everything.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to give away too much yet. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While the initial offer was much better, the inflation factor is a major risk.  There's no guarantee Bob will get more generous in the next round, and I'm risking losing a significant portion of the money.  Accepting this offer ensures I get at least something."
