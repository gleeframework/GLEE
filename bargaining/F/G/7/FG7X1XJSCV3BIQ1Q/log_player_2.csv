"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being generous, but I want most of the money.  Take it or leave it! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's tempting, but I'm not going to accept such a lopsided offer. There are 12 rounds, and I can do better than $100,000. Let's see what Alice offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly. I'm willing to give you 40%, but I need at least 60% to make it worth my while.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a little more, but I need a larger share to make this worthwhile.  It's getting risky for both of us the longer we wait. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While this is better than round 1, I'm still not happy with this offer. It's risky to wait, but I'm confident I can get a better deal in the following rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable.  We're both losing money the longer we wait.  A 50/50 split is the fairest option.""} 
```"
