Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking a big gamble, but I think I can do better than your offer.  Accept this and we'll both walk away with something.  Reject, and we'll both risk losing everything. 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{
