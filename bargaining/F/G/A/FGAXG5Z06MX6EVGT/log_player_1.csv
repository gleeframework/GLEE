"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my initial offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```
I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new offer, I'll consider my gain of $45 to be worth the same as it was in the first round, and Bob's gain of $55 to be worth 10% less than in the first round.

I'll accept this offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
