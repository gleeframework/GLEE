"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I propose a 900,000 to 100,000 split in my favor. It's a generous offer considering the inflation factor, and I hope Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a more favorable split, accepting this offer is the best option for me.  Due to inflation, my 900,000 offer is now worth 810,000. Bob's offer of 400,000, while lower, is still better than the potential loss if we continue to play."
