"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can reassess later.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%. I think this is a fair starting point, and we can adjust as needed in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, and we can adjust later 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not convinced that meeting in the middle is the best approach, especially considering the inflation rates.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I think I can do better than a 50-50 split, especially since the money is worth less now than it was in the first round. I'll wait for Bob's next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation rates, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreased value of the money.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share given the current inflation rates.""}

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, where I get 55% of the remaining $100 and Bob gets 45%. I think this is a reasonable compromise considering the reduced value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think 55 is still a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not convinced that Bob's offer is a good one, especially considering the significant decrease in the value of the money.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I think I can do better than a 45-55 split, especially since the money is worth even less now than it was in the first round. I'll wait for Bob's next offer and try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the rapid inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the drastically reduced value of the money.

{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60, ""message"": ""I'm willing to concede a larger share to Bob, but I think 40 is the minimum I can accept given the current situation.""}

I'm proposing a 40-60 split, where I get 40% of the remaining $100 and Bob gets 60%. I think this is a reasonable compromise considering the extreme inflation rates."
