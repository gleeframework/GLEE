Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting desperate, I'll give you a tiny bit more 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation. While her offer is slightly better, accepting now would set a bad precedent and she's likely to keep lowballing me. It's worth holding out for a better deal, even with the inflation, as long as I don't get too greedy myself."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 48,
""alice_gain"": 52,
""message"": ""Okay, let's be serious. I'm taking a small hit here considering the inflation, but this is a fair deal. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to start getting more serious.  Alice is likely banking on me panicking as the rounds go on and the inflation eats into my potential gains. This offer shows I'm willing to be somewhat fair but won't be pushed around. By framing it as a ""take it or leave it"", I'm applying a bit of pressure for her to accept before the deal gets worse for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","This is getting really tough, but I still need to hold strong. {""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly enjoying this and trying to wear me down. However, accepting a 44/56 split at this stage would be a significant loss. It's a gamble, but I need to show I'm serious about getting a better deal.  She's betting I'll crack under the pressure of the dwindling pot, but I'm banking on her wanting *something* rather than nothing if I hold out long enough."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 47,
""alice_gain"": 53,
""message"": ""This is my final offer.  Take it and we both get something, or we both walk away with nothing.  Your call.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Time for a high-stakes gamble. By framing this as my ""final offer"" I'm creating a sense of urgency and finality. This offer is slightly better than her last, but still heavily favors her.  The key is whether she's willing to risk getting absolutely nothing in hopes of grinding me down further.  It's a bluff, but it might be our last chance for a deal."
