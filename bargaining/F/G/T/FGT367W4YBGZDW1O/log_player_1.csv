Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I think this is a fair starting point 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 4000$ is worth 80% of the original 5000$ I would have gotten in the first round. Not bad, but I'm not sure if I want to give Bob a 60/40 split.
