"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle and split it evenly 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my $8,000 is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $6,400.

Considering Bob's offer, I'd be getting $5,000, which is worth 62.5% of the original $8,000 I was initially offered. This is a better deal than the previous offer, considering the inflation.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
