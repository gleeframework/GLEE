"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going for a relatively high share in the first round, as the inflation will affect me more in later rounds.  I'm leaving Bob a small portion, hoping to incentivize him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is a factor, and I'm losing more value per round than Bob.  Accepting this offer guarantees me some money, and I'm not sure if I can do better in the next round."
