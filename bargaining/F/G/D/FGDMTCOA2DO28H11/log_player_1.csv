"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly!""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I propose that I receive $600,000 and Bob receives $400,000. I've included a message suggesting a fair split, hoping Bob will see the reasonableness of the offer and accept it, considering the looming threat of inflation that affects us both, but more severely impacts Bob. This initial offer sets the stage for negotiations, aiming to find a mutually acceptable division before the value of the money decreases further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to split the money 60/40, with me taking the larger share.  This is a fair offer considering the inflation rates we're facing. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI've decided to reject Bob's offer because, despite the impact of inflation, accepting 40% of the money seems unfair given the initial amount at stake. The difference in inflation rates indeed affects Bob more, but starting with a higher base amount means he's still gaining a significant advantage. Rejecting this offer gives me the chance to propose a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to find a more balanced division considering the decreasing value of the money for both of us."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet closer to the middle.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I've adjusted my proposal to take into account the effects of inflation on both of our potential gains. By offering a 55/45 split, with me receiving $550,000 and Bob receiving $450,000, I'm attempting to find a compromise that acknowledges the greater impact of inflation on Bob's share while still recognizing the initial value of the money. The message aims to convey a willingness to negotiate and find a mutually acceptable division before the value of the money decreases further."
