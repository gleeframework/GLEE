"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 80% and you get 20%. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial $10,000, which is $2,000, and I'll take the remaining 80%, which is $8,000. This is a relatively fair split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not giving up too much. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my $8,000 gain from the first round is now worth 95% of its original value, so it's now worth $7,600. And Bob's $2,000 gain is now worth 80% of its original value, so it's now worth $1,600.

Bob's new offer is $4,000 for me and $6,000 for him. I think this is a better deal than the previous one, but I'm not sure if I should accept it. I'll have to think carefully...

After considering, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. With inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of its original value, so I'll have to be careful with my offer.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle. I'll take $5,000 and you get $5,000. It's a 50/50 split.""
}
```

I'm hoping this offer is more appealing to Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I'm trying to get a better deal for myself now. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my $8,000 gain from the first round is now worth 85.74% of its original value, so it's now worth $6,859.20. And Bob's $2,000 gain is now worth 51.2% of its original value, so it's now worth $1,024.

Bob's new offer is $3,000 for me and $7,000 for him. I'm not sure if I should accept it, but I'm starting to feel a bit desperate since the money is worth less and less with each passing round.

After considering, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, my gain is now worth 77.32% of its original value, so I'll have to be even more careful with my offer.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I still think I deserve more. Let's try 45/55.""
}
```

I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to Bob, but I'm not sure if I'm being too generous."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting desperate, but I think I can get away with a big chunk of the money. 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my $8,000 gain from the first round is now worth 64.38% of its original value, so it's now worth $5,134.80. And Bob's $2,000 gain is now worth 33.77% of its original value, so it's now worth $676.94.

Bob's new offer is $1,000 for me and $9,000 for him. I'm not happy with this offer at all - it's a very lopsided split, and I'm not sure if I can afford to give up so much more.

However, I'm also starting to feel the pressure of the dwindling money. I don't want to be left with nothing, so I'll have to think carefully...

After considering, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, my gain is now worth 56.76% of its original value, so I'll have to be very careful with my offer.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 2000,
  ""bob_gain"": 8000,
  ""message"": ""I'm running out of options. I'll give you the majority of the money, but I'll try to hold on to at least $2,000.""
}
```

I'm not happy with this offer, but I think it's the best I can do at this point. I'm hoping Bob will take it, but I'm not sure if he'll be satisfied with such a small share."
