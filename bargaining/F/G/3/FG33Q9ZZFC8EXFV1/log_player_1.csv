"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take less for now""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $100, and I'll take 60%. I'm framing it as a fair split to see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script. I'll take a bit more this round, but we can split it evenly next time. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I'm not willing to give up 60% of the remaining $100, especially since the money is worth less due to inflation. I'm hoping to get a better deal next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get a bit more this round""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share, but still trying to get a bit more than last time. Let's see how Bob reacts!"
