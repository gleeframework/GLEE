Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000

I'm offering Bob $200,000, and I'll take the remaining $800,000."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll think carefully before making a decision. Considering the inflation, I'll have to be cautious about accepting an offer that gives me a relatively small share.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the 10% decrease in value of the money I'll receive due to inflation.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, and I'll take the remaining $600,000."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

Considering the inflation, the money I'll receive is worth significantly less than in the first round. However, Bob's offer is still a substantial amount, and I'm not sure if I should push for more.

I'll think carefully and... accept Bob's offer.
