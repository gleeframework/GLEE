{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000, ""message"": ""I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  This is a fair starting point given the inflation dynamic, and I hope we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 50/50 split. I believe this is fair considering the inflation and the fact that the value of money decreases with each round. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
