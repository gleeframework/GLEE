"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

This is a generous offer, as I'm giving Bob a significant portion of the money, but I'm also keeping the majority of it, which is a good starting point for me considering the inflation factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the money I gain is now worth significantly less than in the first round. Bob's offer seems quite aggressive, but I'll consider it.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
