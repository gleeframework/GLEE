6000.0,4000.0,"Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I get $6000, you get $4000. It's better to settle now than to risk losing more to inflation.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Considering the inflation, I think this is a fair offer. You'll lose more if we keep going.",Bob,2,

5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, it's clear we both want a larger share, but letting this drag on hurts us both. I'll meet you in the middle - $5500 for me, $4500 for you.  Let's end this before inflation eats away at more of our potential gains.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4200.0,5800.0,"I know we're both losing, but you're losing more. I'm willing to end this, but I need a bit more to make up for the previous offers. This is as fair as it gets considering the inflation.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Bob, this is getting us nowhere. We're both losing money with every passing round. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical option at this point.  Let's just end this here before we lose even more.",Alice,5,
