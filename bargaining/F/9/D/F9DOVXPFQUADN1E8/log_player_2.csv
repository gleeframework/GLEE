"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I get $6000, you get $4000. It's better to settle now than to risk losing more to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI think I can get a better offer in the next round. The 5% inflation won't hurt me as much as the 10% will hurt Alice.\n\n###\n\nLet's see what the next round brings! What's Alice's next move?"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a fair offer. You'll lose more if we keep going.""}\n\n###\n\nLet's see if Alice accepts this offer!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want a larger share, but letting this drag on hurts us both. I'll meet you in the middle - $5500 for me, $4500 for you.  Let's end this before inflation eats away at more of our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI think I can push for a bit more, considering Alice is losing more to inflation than I am. Meeting in the middle isn't so fair when the losses aren't equal.\n\n###\n\nLet's see what Alice does next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""I know we're both losing, but you're losing more. I'm willing to end this, but I need a bit more to make up for the previous offers. This is as fair as it gets considering the inflation.""}\n\n###\n\nWill Alice accept this offer?"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting us nowhere. We're both losing money with every passing round. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical option at this point.  Let's just end this here before we lose even more. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nAt this point, with the significant loss due to inflation, especially for Alice, and considering my previous offers were rejected, a 50/50 split seems like the most reasonable way to end this game. Continuing would only lead to further loss for both of us, and I've managed to get to a point where the offer is as good as it's likely to get.\n\n###\n\nIt's time to settle and move on!"
