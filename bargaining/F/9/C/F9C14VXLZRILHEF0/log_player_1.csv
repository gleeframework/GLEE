"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, I'm a generous Alice!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but it's a straightforward and fair deal. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject the offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous in round 1, now it's my turn to be generous! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob thinks he's being generous now!

However, I'm not convinced. I'd rather wait for a better offer. I'll reject this one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

  ""alice_gain"": 810000,
  ""bob_gain"": 190000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob!""

I'm aiming for a more balanced split this time. Let's see if Bob will accept!"

Round 4

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to make a serious offer now!

However, I'm not convinced that 300,000 is a fair share for me, considering the initial amount was 1,000,000. I'd like to see a better offer.
