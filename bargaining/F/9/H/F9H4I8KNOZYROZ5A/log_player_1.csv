"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1} 
```

I propose to take almost all the money, leaving Bob with a single dollar. This is a risky strategy, but it maximizes my potential gain in the first round, before inflation starts to significantly impact Bob's share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my initial proposal, even accounting for inflation. I'm confident I can secure a better deal by rejecting his offer and making my own in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm offering Bob 300,000, which is less than his previous offer, but still a significant sum. This should be appealing to him, especially considering the inflation penalty."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I was aiming for, the inflation penalty is starting to hurt. Accepting a 50/50 split is the best way to secure a decent amount before the money loses even more value."
