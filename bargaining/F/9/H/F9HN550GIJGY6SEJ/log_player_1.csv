Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}

This is a fair and equal split, which I hope Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to take a larger share, but I'm not willing to give up that much. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob's offer was 60/40 in his favor, I'll try to adjust the ratio in my favor. Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}

This is a bit more favorable to me, but still a reasonable compromise."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Bob's last offer was 70/30 in his favor, so I'll try to push the ratio back in my favor a bit. Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}

This is a more balanced proposal, but I'm still trying to get a slightly larger share."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I think I've seen enough of Bob's aggressive offers. It's time for me to make a strong counteroffer. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}

This is a 70/30 split, which I think is a fair and reasonable offer considering the previous proposals."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'm not going to let Bob take advantage of me anymore. It's time to make a final, strong offer. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}

This is a 90/10 split, and I'm willing to walk away if Bob doesn't accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'm not going to give in to Bob's ridiculous demands anymore. Here's my final offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 999000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000
}

This is a 99.9% share for me, and I'm willing to walk away with it if Bob doesn't accept it."

Round 12
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500

I guess we'll be splitting nothing!"
