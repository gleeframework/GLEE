Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a decent share, but I'm not going to give away too much too soon. Let's see if you're willing to negotiate. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I reject this offer. While it's better than Bob's previous offer, it's still heavily skewed in his favor.  I'm hoping to reach a more equitable split, especially with the knowledge that inflation is impacting him more than me."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give away too much more. Let's see if you're willing to meet me in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I reject this offer. While Bob's message suggests he's willing to compromise, the offer itself is still heavily skewed in his favor.  The inflation is hitting him harder, so I'm holding out for a more balanced split. I believe we can reach a better outcome with further negotiation."

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm still hoping for a fairer deal.  Let's split the difference from the last offer and move towards a more equitable outcome. We both need to be willing to compromise.""}

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway and split the difference. Let's take a chance on a 50/50 split and see if it works out for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

I accept this offer. While I'd prefer a slightly higher share, the inflation is impacting Bob significantly, and a 50/50 split is a fair and reasonable compromise. I'm happy to move forward with this agreement."
