**Explanation:**

In the first round, Alice proposed a very unequal split. In the second round, Bob made a slightly more equal split, but Alice still rejected it. In round 3, Alice tried to take the larger share again, but Bob rejected. Now, in round 4, Alice is facing a 48.8% reduction in the value of her potential earnings.  While this offer is still not ideal, the risk of continuing the game is too high. Accepting the offer ensures a gain, even if it is significantly smaller than what she would have received initially."
