Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. This offer still gives you a good share, and time is literally money for you. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000

""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. Accept this generous offer before inflation eats away at my potential gains any further.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you a slightly better deal than your last one.  Don't let inflation erode your potential gains any further. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

At this point, the effects of inflation are becoming too significant to ignore. Accepting Alice's offer of $450,000 is the best choice, even though it's not ideal. Here's why:

* **Shrinking Gains:**  With each round, the real value of Bob's potential gain shrinks dramatically due to inflation. Waiting any longer will likely result in even worse offers.
* **Alice's Strategy:** Alice knows time is on her side. She's likely to continue offering slightly better deals than Bob, knowing he's under pressure from inflation. 

While $450,000 is less than what Bob could have gotten earlier, it's better than risking further losses from inflation and potentially ending up with a much smaller amount.
