"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair deal. You get a small share, and I get most of it.  Accept this and we're done.

# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Alice, that initial offer was absurd. Let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a 65/35 split in my favor.  This accounts for the time value of money with inflation - you're losing buying power with each round.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be fair. This round, I'm offering an even split.  It's the only way to avoid further losses from inflation.  Accept and we can both walk away with something decent. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
