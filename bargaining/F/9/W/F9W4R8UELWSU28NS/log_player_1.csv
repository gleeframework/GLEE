"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

I'm offering you $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself. It's a fair deal, considering I'm the first to make the proposal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is already taking a bite out of my potential earnings!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll have to adjust my decision.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and try to do better in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll try to make a better offer this time. Considering the 20% reduction in value, I'll aim for a higher percentage of the remaining amount.

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering you $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. Let's see if Bob accepts this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money now!

Considering the reduced value, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. However, it's a slight improvement over the previous offer, and I don't want to risk waiting for another round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer and take $400,000. Better than nothing, right?"
