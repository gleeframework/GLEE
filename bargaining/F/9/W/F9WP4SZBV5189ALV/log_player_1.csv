"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need for negotiations""
}

This is a straightforward and fair proposal, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can end the game here."

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. If I accept this offer, I'll get $400,000, which is worth the same as in the first round, but Bob will get $600,000, which is worth 5% more than in the first round.

I'm not sure if I want to give Bob a larger share, considering the inflation factor. I'll have to decide...

Round 3

  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,

# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another offer from Bob! It seems like he's not willing to budge from his 55/45 split. However, this time he's offered me $450,000, which is worth 10% less than in the first round, while he's still getting $550,000, which is worth 5% more than in the first round.

I'm not sure if I want to give up more money, considering the inflation factor. I'll have to think carefully...

# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, let's try to find a compromise 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to find a compromise now. His offer is a 50/50 split, which is a significant concession from his previous offers. Considering the inflation factor, I'll have to think carefully about this one.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round, I'm not sure if this is the best I can get. I'll have to decide...
