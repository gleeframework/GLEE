Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a little too skewed in your favor. How about a 55/45 split instead?  It's still a better deal for you, but closer to even. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
