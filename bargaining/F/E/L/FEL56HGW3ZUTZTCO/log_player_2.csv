Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is affecting you, but I'm not getting any less. My share should be higher. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000

Round 4

""alice_gain"": 520000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is becoming a serious problem for me. I'm willing to accept a smaller share than my previous offer, but I need you to meet me halfway.  This offer is my final attempt to reach a compromise.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final attempt, but I'm not budging. Inflation is hurting you, not me. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, the effects of inflation are too severe. Accepting Alice's offer, while far from ideal, is the only way to secure any significant amount of money. 

Here's why:

* **Shrinking Value:**  The money is losing value rapidly for Bob. Waiting any longer means getting even less.
* **Alice's Stance:** Alice has shown no willingness to compromise. It's unlikely she'll offer anything better.

While $300,000 is much less than Bob hoped for, it's better than waiting another round and potentially receiving an even worse offer, or even reaching a point where accepting any amount is pointless due to the extreme effects of inflation."
