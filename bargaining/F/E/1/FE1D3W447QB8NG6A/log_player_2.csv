"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair deal. I take the majority, but you get a decent share.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While the offer is tempting, it's best to play it safe in the first round and see if I can get a better deal later.  The inflation factor means that delaying could lead to a larger absolute gain for me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""I think this is a fair starting point. Let's see if we can both get a better deal later.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I still need a larger share to make it worthwhile.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While it's tempting to take the offer, it's still too early in the game.  Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, so there's potential for a better deal for me in the future."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's try a 50/50 split. This is a fair and simple solution, and we both get a decent share.""}
```"
