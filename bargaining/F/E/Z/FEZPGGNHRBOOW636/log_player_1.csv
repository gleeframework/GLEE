Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a large initial offer to Bob. Hopefully, he'll accept and we can both get a good share. Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is ridiculously unfair, especially considering the inflation. It's a blatant attempt to take almost everything for himself. I'm not going to accept that.  Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm still aiming for a majority of the money, but I'm scaling back my initial offer a bit. Bob's greed seems pretty clear, so I need to adjust my strategy.  This offer gives Bob a decent amount, but still leaves me with the lion's share.  Let's see if he'll accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still extremely unfair. While I understand the inflation is affecting him, he's still trying to get away with taking a huge majority of the money. I'm not going to accept that. I'll make my own offer in the next round and see if we can reach a more reasonable agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

This time, I'm dropping my share further, but I'm still leaving Bob with a significant portion.  I'm hoping this shows him I'm willing to negotiate fairly, but I'm not willing to be taken advantage of. It's time for a change in tactics."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still trying to get away with taking the majority of the money. While I understand the inflation is hurting him, he needs to be more realistic. I'm not going to accept this offer. We need to find a compromise, and I'll try to make a more balanced offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

We're getting closer to the end of the game. The inflation is starting to bite, so I need to make a compromise. This offer gives Bob a larger share, but it's still closer to a fair split. I'm hoping that Bob will be more willing to accept a more equal division."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While this offer still favors Bob, the inflation is really hitting him hard, and he's unlikely to get a better deal in the remaining rounds. I need to secure some money for myself, so I'll accept this offer. This is the best I can do under the current circumstances."
