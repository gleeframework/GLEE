"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly considering the inflation impact 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer sounds fair on the surface, the inflation heavily favors Bob in later rounds. Rejecting this offer puts me in the position of power to propose a more favorable split in Round 2."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""message"": ""I understand the inflation puts you at a disadvantage. Let's be fair, this offer accounts for future losses.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Positioning:** By rejecting Alice's offer, I've signaled my intent for a larger share. This offer maintains a slight advantage for Alice (considering the long-term inflation impact), making it more likely she'll accept.
* **Psychological Tactic:** The message appeals to fairness and acknowledges Alice's concerns, increasing the chance of acceptance.
* **Time Sensitivity:**  Every round counts. While I could push for a more significant share in later rounds, there's a risk Alice might get impatient and reject future offers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the increasing inflation impact, let's meet halfway 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting desperate.  While her offer is closer to a 50/50 split, the rapidly increasing inflation means my position is only getting stronger. I can afford to wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Time is running out, and we both lose if this fails. Let's end this with a clean, even split.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  Four rounds have passed, and the pot is shrinking fast.  While I'm in a strong position,  the risk of getting nothing is escalating.
* **Simplified Offer:**  A 50/50 split is the easiest to understand and accept.  It removes complexity and potential for disagreement at this critical stage. 
* **Urgency Appeal:**  The message emphasizes the shared risk and encourages a swift resolution. 

By offering a 50/50 split now, I aim to capitalize on the time pressure and Alice's desire to secure a deal before the inflation eats away at the value even further."
