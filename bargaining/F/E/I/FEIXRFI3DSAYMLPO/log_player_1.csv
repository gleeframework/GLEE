"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a clean slate. I'll take the first 100, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I take the entire $100, but I'm sure Bob will reject this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest way to start. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money I gain is now worth 80% of its original value, so I'll be getting $80 if I accept this offer.

I'll accept Bob's offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
