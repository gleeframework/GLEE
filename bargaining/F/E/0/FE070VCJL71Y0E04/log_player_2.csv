"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the money in an 80/20 ratio, with you receiving $2000. I believe this is fair given the potential inflation. 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's a tempting offer in Round 1, but the potential for inflation makes it risky to accept such a low share. Let's see what Alice offers in the next round after the value of the money has decreased for Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I propose a 60/40 split in our favor.  The value of the money is already decreasing, and we need to secure a larger share to make the most of this opportunity.""
}
