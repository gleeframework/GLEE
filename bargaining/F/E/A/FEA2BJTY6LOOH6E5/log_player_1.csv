"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $60 and Bob getting $40. I'm framing it as a fair starting point, hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. Since Bob's offer is to meet in the middle, that means we'll both get $50.

I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. I think I can do better than 50-50, especially considering the inflation is affecting me more than Bob. I'll wait for his next offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and the fact that I rejected Bob's 50-50 offer, I'll make a new proposal that's slightly more skewed towards me. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more. Can we try 55-45?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, with me getting $55 and Bob getting $45. I'm framing it as a compromise, hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give a bit more, but I think 55-45 is too close to your previous offer. Let's try 52-48! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my gains!

Considering the new offer from Bob, I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer of a 52-48 split, with me getting $48 and Bob getting $52. It's not the best deal I could have hoped for, but it's better than nothing, and I don't want to risk going into another round with the inflation eating away at my potential gains."
