"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's offer was 25$ for me and 75$ for her, I'll make a counteroffer that is closer to 50% for me, considering the inflation factor. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, and I was offered 25$ then, I'll aim to get a bit more this time. However, I'll also consider the fact that the money I gain is still worth the same, and Alice's gain is worth less due to inflation.

I'll accept this offer, as it's a good compromise. 

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
