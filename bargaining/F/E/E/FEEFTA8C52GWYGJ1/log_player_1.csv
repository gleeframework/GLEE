"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a bold move. I'll take the whole 100$ if you don't like it, but I think it's a fair starting point.""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finish the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's start with a fair split. We both get half, and we can adjust things later if we need to. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","A fair split, huh? That's a reasonable proposal. However, I'm not sure if I want to give up the opportunity to negotiate further. I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less now due to inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes that into account. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation. This way, we both get a decent share.""
}
```"
