"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a bold move. I'll take the whole 100$ if you don't like it, but I think it's a fair starting point. 
# Bob gain: 0 
# Alice gain: 100 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm not going to accept such a lopsided deal! I want to play this game fairly. Let's see what Alice offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. We both get half, and we can adjust things later if we need to.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation. This way, we both get a decent share. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'm not thrilled about the 40/60 split,  it's better than getting nothing due to inflation. Accepting this offer ensures I at least get something, and we can negotiate more fairly in future rounds if the game continues."
