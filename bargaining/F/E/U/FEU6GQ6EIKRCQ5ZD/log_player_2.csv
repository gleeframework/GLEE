# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle? 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting closer? 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation and her offers are getting better for Bob.  She's still trying to take a larger share, but the gap is closing. I believe Bob can get a slightly better deal if he holds out for another round or two."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5050, ""alice_gain"": 4950, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and end this.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to a 50/50 split due to the inflation pressure.  Offering a slight edge to Bob (50.5% / 49.5%) might be enticing enough for her to accept, ending the game before the stakes diminish further."
