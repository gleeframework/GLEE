"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This offer gives me the majority of the money, as I am the one making the proposal. I am taking advantage of the fact that Bob's money is worth 10% less with each round. However, it's still a relatively small amount for me to keep, as I expect Bob to be more likely to accept this offer than one that gives him nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is now offering me a much smaller share of the money, but is still keeping a large portion for himself. I will reject this offer as I am confident that I can get a better deal in the next round. Even with the 10% inflation on his side, he has the incentive to offer me a larger share to avoid getting nothing in the final round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
``` 

Since we're both in a position where our money will be worth less if we keep rejecting offers, I'm proposing a 50/50 split. This is the fairest option, and it ensures we both get a decent share of the money before inflation completely devalues it."
