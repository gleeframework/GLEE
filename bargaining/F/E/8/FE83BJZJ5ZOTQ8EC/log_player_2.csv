"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The total amount of money is $10,000. If I accept this offer, I will get $4,000 and Alice will get $6,000. Since this is the first round, there is no inflation yet, so the money is still worth its full value.\n\nSince I am playing as Bob, I need to decide whether to accept this offer or reject it and proceed to the next round. In the next round, I will be the one making the proposal, and the money will be worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Alice due to inflation.\n\nLet's analyze the offer. Alice is offering me $4,000, which is 40% of the total amount. This seems like a relatively fair offer, but I need to consider the inflation factor. If I reject this offer and proceed to the next round, the money will be worth less, so I may end up with a worse deal.\n\nHowever, I also need to consider that Alice is trying to get 60% of the total amount, which is a bit greedy. If I reject this offer, I may be able to negotiate a better deal in the next round.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I have decided to reject this offer. I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the next round, and I am willing to take the risk of the money being worth less due to inflation.\n\nHere is my response:\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nPlease relay this message to Alice and let me know her next move."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Since we are now in the second round, the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Alice due to inflation. This means that the total amount of $10,000 is now effectively worth $9,000 for me (10% less) and $8,000 for Alice (20% less).\n\nConsidering this, I will make an offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money. I will offer Alice a smaller share, hoping that she will accept it given the decreasing value of the money.\n\nHere is my offer:\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a fair offer""}\n\nPlease relay this message to Alice and let me know her response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Counter offer, considering inflation 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze the offer. Alice is offering me $4,200, which is slightly more than the 40% I was initially offered in Round 1, but considering the 19% decrease in value due to inflation, this amount is actually worth less than the initial offer.\n\nOn the other hand, Alice is trying to get $5,800, which is still a relatively large share of the total amount. Given the 36% decrease in value for her, this amount is also worth less than the initial offer, but she is still trying to get a larger share than me.\n\nConsidering the decreasing value of the money and the fact that Alice is still trying to get a larger share, I have decided to reject this offer. I believe I can still negotiate a better deal, and I am willing to take the risk of the money being worth even less in the next round.\n\nHere is my response:\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nPlease relay this message to Alice and let me know her next move."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","We are now in the fourth round, and the money is worth 19% less for me and 36% less for Alice due to inflation. This means that the total amount of $10,000 is now effectively worth $8,100 for me (19% less) and $6,400 for Alice (36% less).\n\nConsidering this, I will make an offer that takes into account the significantly reduced value of the money for both of us. I will offer Alice a smaller share, hoping that she will accept it given the rapidly decreasing value of the money.\n\nHere is my offer:\n{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Inflation is killing us, let's settle""}\n\nPlease relay this message to Alice and let me know her response."
