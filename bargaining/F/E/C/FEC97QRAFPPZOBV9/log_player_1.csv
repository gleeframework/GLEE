I'm going to propose a split that heavily favors me, since I have the first move. I figure I can secure a good portion of the money, as Bob doesn't know about the inflation yet.  Let's see if he bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation.  I'm going to reject this offer and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

I'm going to offer a more balanced split this time.  Since I know about inflation, I'm going to try to secure a decent amount of money, but I also want to make sure Bob is willing to accept the offer."
