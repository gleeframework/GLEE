**Reasoning:**

Alice is stubbornly sticking close to her initial offer, even though the value of the money is decreasing.  I'm betting she'll become more reasonable as we get closer to the deadline and the stakes of losing everything increase."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Split the difference

# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice finally budged a bit, but it's still not a good deal considering the rapidly decreasing value. By consistently offering slightly better deals than her, I'm hoping to either reach an agreement close to 50/50 or force her hand to accept a less favorable split as the deadline approaches."
