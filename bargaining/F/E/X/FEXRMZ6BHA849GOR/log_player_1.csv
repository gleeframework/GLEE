"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take the majority, but I'm willing to give you a decent chunk to get us started.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 90% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob gets the remaining 10%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer to get the game started."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I want to keep the majority for myself. Your turn to think about it. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think giving me only 20% of the remaining amount is a fair deal, considering the value of the money is decreasing over time. I'd like to propose a new offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

  ""message"": ""I'll meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more for taking the risk of inflation.""
}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, hoping that Bob will see the value in sharing the wealth more evenly and accept this offer."

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think giving me only 45% of the remaining amount is a fair deal, considering the value of the money is decreasing at an increasing rate. I'd like to propose a new offer in the next round, trying to get a better share before the money loses too much value."

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think giving me only 30% of the remaining amount is a fair deal, considering the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. I'd like to propose a new offer in the next round, trying to get a better share before it's too late."

Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 30.17% less for me and 52.17% less for Bob, I'm starting to get worried that I'll get nothing if I don't accept this offer. However, giving me only 15% of the remaining amount is still not very appealing.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to propose a new offer in the next round, but I'm getting desperate and the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. I'm hoping that Bob will make a more generous offer or that I can come up with a better proposal to sway him."

}
```

Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 36.98% less for me and 61.26% less for Bob, I'm getting extremely desperate. Giving me only 5% of the remaining amount is a very poor offer, but I'm starting to think that it's better than getting nothing.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer, hoping that I can at least get something out of this deal, even if it's a tiny fraction of the original amount."
