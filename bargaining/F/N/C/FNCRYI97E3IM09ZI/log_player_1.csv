"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take 80 and you can take 20. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm starting with a generous offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 20% less for me, so I'll have to be more careful with my decisions.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to meet in the middle just yet. I think I can do better than 50% each."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll try to be more aggressive with my offer.

Here's my proposal for round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll take 60, you can have 40. It's a good deal, don't be greedy!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a large share, but I need something too! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth even less than before, I'll have to be more cautious with my decisions.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the 70% and hope it's the best I can get, considering the inflation is eating away at the value of the money."
