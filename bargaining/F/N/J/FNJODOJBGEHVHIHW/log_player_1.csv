Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can get a better deal, even considering the inflation. I was willing to give Bob 40% in the first round, but now he's offering me only 40% after the money has already lost 10% of its value. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
