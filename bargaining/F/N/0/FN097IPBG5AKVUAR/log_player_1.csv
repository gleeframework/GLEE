Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is taking its toll, let's end this. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the offer is tempting as inflation is eating into the potential gains, accepting this would mean I get significantly less than half. It's worth risking another round to try and secure a better deal, even if it means a smaller pot overall."
