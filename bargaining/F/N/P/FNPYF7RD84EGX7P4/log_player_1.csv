"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take the majority, but you'll still get a decent chunk.""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $10,000, which is $8,000, and Bob gets the remaining $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, no need to fight for more. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth 20% less for me, $5000 is equivalent to $4000 in the previous round. Similarly, Bob's $5000 is equivalent to $4750 in the previous round.

Considering the message, it seems like Bob is trying to be conciliatory and meet in the middle. While I could try to negotiate further, I think this offer is reasonable, especially since the money is decreasing in value with each round.

I'll accept this offer.
