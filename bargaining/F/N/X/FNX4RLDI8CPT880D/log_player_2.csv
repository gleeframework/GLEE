"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair.  I propose a 55/45 split in my favor.  It's a good starting point, and we can adjust as we go. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
Let's see if we can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 51, ""alice_gain"": 49, ""message"": ""I think a 51/49 split in my favor is more fair, considering the inflation. Let's start with that and see where we can go from there.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 52/48. This acknowledges the inflation, but keeps things closer to the initial 55/45 split.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
Let's take this deal. It's closer to what I initially wanted, and the inflation is getting worse."
