This is a tough one! Here's why I'm finally accepting:

* **Inflation is Hurting Bob More:**  Bob's money is devaluing at a much faster rate (20% per round) than mine (5% per round). This means time is working in my favor.
* **Diminishing Returns:** While I'd prefer a larger share, waiting longer means the overall pot shrinks significantly for both of us.  
* **Guaranteed Payout:** Accepting now guarantees me $500,000 (which has lost value, but is still a significant amount).  Rejecting this offer risks getting nothing if we don't reach an agreement in the next 6 rounds. 

It's a gamble either way, but accepting the 50/50 split feels like the safest option at this stage."
