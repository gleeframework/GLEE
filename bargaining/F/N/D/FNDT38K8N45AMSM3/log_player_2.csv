Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, Bob! Inflation is eating into your share, let's settle on 58-42 before it gets worse for you. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 520000, ""alice_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. Take this offer before inflation makes it pointless for me to even bother.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're losing value fast! 55-45 is more than fair considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

At this point, accepting is the most logical choice for Bob. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:** Inflation is severely eroding Bob's potential gains each round. While he started aiming for a near-even split, accepting 45% now might be better than a slightly higher percentage later, which would be worth significantly less.
* **Alice's Stance:** Alice seems firm on not going below a 55/45 split in her favor.  She's using inflation as leverage, and it's working.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Rejecting this offer risks getting even less in future rounds if Alice decides to push her advantage further.

While accepting means Bob gets less than his ideal share, it's the most rational decision considering the circumstances and the rapid devaluation of his potential gains.
