"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer was heavily skewed in your favor. Let's be reasonable - I'm proposing a more balanced split this time.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's split the money 60/40. This is a fairer offer than your last one, and it allows us to end this game before inflation eats away too much of our earnings. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While it's not an ideal split, accepting guarantees me $4000. Rejecting and going to another round risks Alice lowballing me even further, especially with the inflation working against her."
