"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 70/30, seems fair""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 30 dollars, and I'll get 70 dollars. I think this is a reasonable split, considering I'm the one making the first proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Will you take 60%? 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the effective values are:

* Alice's gain: 40 dollars (worth 80% of 50 dollars, since 20% less than 70)
* Bob's gain: 60 dollars (worth 95% of 63.64 dollars, since 5% less than 66.67)

I'm not too thrilled about this offer, but it's better than nothing. I'll accept Bob's offer.
