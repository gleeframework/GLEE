"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 40%""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than a 40/60 split.  Let's go for a 55/45 split, which is fairer to both of us given the inflation rates. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation rates, the effective gains for me would be $45 * 0.9 = $40.50, and for Bob would be $55 * 0.95 = $52.25.

I'm not too thrilled about this offer, but it's an improvement over the previous one. I'll accept it.
