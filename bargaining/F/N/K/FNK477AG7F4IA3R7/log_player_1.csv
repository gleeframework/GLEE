"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! I'll take 80% of the initial amount, and you can have 20%. It's a fair starting point, don't you think?""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think we can do better than that. Your turn! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, the actual amount I'd get from Bob's offer is:

400,000 * 0.95 = 380,000

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, as I'd be giving up a significant amount of money. However, I don't want to risk waiting for a better offer, so I'll accept Bob's proposal.
