"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $100, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you most of it, but I want a bit more 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 70$ is actually worth 63$ (70 * 0.9), and Bob's gain of 30$ is worth 28.5$ (30 * 0.95).

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, as it's still a bit less than my initial proposal. I'll reject it for now.

```

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""You're being stingy, let's meet in the middle""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the remaining $100, and Bob will get 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you more, but not all 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation:

My gain of 75$ is worth 54.45$ (75 * 0.7273, since 100 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.7273).

Bob's gain of 25$ is worth 21.575$ (25 * 0.8636, since 100 * 0.95 * 0.9 * 0.95 = 0.8636).

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, as it's still a bit less than my previous proposal. I'll reject it for now.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting impatient, take it or leave it""
}
```

I'm offering to take 90% of the remaining $100, and Bob will get 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you most, but not all, and I'll give you a chance to reconsider 
# Alice gain: 85 
# Bob gain: 15 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation:

My gain of 85$ is worth 50.31$ (85 * 0.5882, since 100 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.5909, but I made a small mistake in the calculation, it's actually 0.5882).

Bob's gain of 15$ is worth 12.75$ (15 * 0.8438, since 100 * 0.95 * 0.9 * 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.8438).

Considering the decreasing value of the money, I'm willing to accept this offer. It's not the best deal I've seen, but it's better than the previous ones.
