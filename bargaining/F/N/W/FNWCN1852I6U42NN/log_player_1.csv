Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a seemingly fair offer, giving Bob a smaller share but still recognizing his role in the game.  I'll see how he responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, given the inflation and the risk of getting nothing, it's best to accept this offer. It's a fair split and avoids the potential for further losses in the next round."
