Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 70/30 is a more fair split, considering we both have an equal chance of getting the better end of the deal.  Let's be reasonable and split it this way. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000
