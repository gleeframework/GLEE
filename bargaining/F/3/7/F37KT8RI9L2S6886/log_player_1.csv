"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20, a fair starting point?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $20 and keeping $80 for myself, and I'm framing it as a fair starting point to see if he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's split it 50-50 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my calculation.

In Round 1, I would have gained $80, but due to 10% inflation, it's now worth 90% of that, which is $72. However, in Round 2, Bob's offer is to split it 50-50, so I'd gain $50, which is 50% of the current $100. Considering the inflation, $50 in this round is equivalent to $55 in the first round.

Given the offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
