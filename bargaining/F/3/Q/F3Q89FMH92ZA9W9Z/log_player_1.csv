"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 999,999,
  ""bob_gain"": 1,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob! You'll get $1 and I'll get the rest.""
}
```

I'm making a very generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it quickly so we can both get our shares!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money evenly. It's fair for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","A fair proposal, but I'm not sure if it's the best one for me.

I'd rather wait and see if I can get more in the next round. The inflation is affecting Bob's gains, so I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation taking a 20% toll on Bob's gains, I'll try to take advantage of that. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900,001,
  ""bob_gain"": 99999,
  ""message"": ""You're losing value with each round, Bob. Take this offer and don't lose out!""
}
```"
