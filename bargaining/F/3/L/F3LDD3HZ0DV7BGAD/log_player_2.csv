"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and you get 10%. I think that's a reasonable starting point. Let me know what you think!

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Your offer was quite imbalanced. Let's be more realistic. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  This round is your chance to secure a good amount before inflation eats away at the value.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I understand your point about being more realistic. I'm willing to come down to a 55/45 split in my favor.  Let's not let inflation erode our gains any further. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is getting closer to a reasonable split, it's still heavily in her favor. We're only in round 3, and the inflation impact isn't drastic yet. I believe I can negotiate a better deal."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""I appreciate you moving closer to a fair split. However, I'm aiming for a slightly better outcome for myself.  I propose 52/48. It's a reasonable advantage for me this early in the game, and it still leaves you with a significant sum.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle. I propose a 50/50 split. This is the fairest option at this point, and we can both walk away with a decent amount before inflation erodes our gains further. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  A 50/50 split is the fairest possible outcome, and while I was hoping for a slight advantage, accepting now guarantees a decent sum. Waiting longer risks further inflation erosion, and there's no guarantee Alice will offer this much again."
