"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and let's end the game quickly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but it's a fair start to the game, and I'm hoping he'll accept and we can wrap things up quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a fairer split. Let's agree and move on! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I need to be strategic.

I'll reject this offer for now. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth even less now, I'll have to be more aggressive with my offer. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob! The value of the money is dropping fast!""
}
```

I'm trying to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth less, and I'm offering Bob a smaller share. Let's see if he'll bite!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle. It's the only way to ensure we both get a decent amount before the value drops too much further. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not sure if splitting it down the middle is the best idea, considering the inflation rates. However, I don't want to risk waiting for another offer and losing even more value.

I'll accept Bob's offer, but I'm hoping he'll regret it later.
