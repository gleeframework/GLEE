"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, Alice proposes to take $600,000 and leave $400,000 for Bob, with a message suggesting that this division is fair but slightly in her favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, but let's be realistic. This is a good deal for you before inflation eats away at it further. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer because I think I can get a better deal in the next round, considering the inflation affects Bob's gain more than mine."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Inflation is on my side, you should take this before it gets worse for you""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I increase my proposed share to $650,000 and decrease Bob's share to $350,000, pointing out in the message that due to inflation, it's advantageous for Bob to accept this offer before his potential gain decreases further in value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. Take it before inflation makes it even less appealing for me. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI'll accept this offer. Considering the significant impact of inflation on Bob's gain and the fact that this is his ""final offer,"" it seems unlikely that I can negotiate a better deal in further rounds. Accepting $550,000 now is more advantageous than risking further negotiations where Bob might decide to offer less due to the decreasing value of his share."
