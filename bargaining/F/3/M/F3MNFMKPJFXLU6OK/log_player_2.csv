"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'm offering you a 40% share. Hopefully, we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly. This way, we both get a fair share, and we can avoid the risk of inflation eating away at our potential earnings.""}
