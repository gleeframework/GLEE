Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your fairness, Alice.  But I believe we can both do better. Since the money loses value over time, it makes more sense for me to take a bit more now. Let's split the difference. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
