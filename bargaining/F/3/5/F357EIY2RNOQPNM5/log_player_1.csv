"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that we divide the $100 in a 60:40 ratio, with me getting $60 and Bob getting $40. I'm framing it as a ""fair split"" to try to get Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bigger share, but I still want to keep some for myself. 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my $60 gain is now worth 90% of its original value, and Bob's $40 gain is now worth 80% of its original value.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'm not sure if it's a good deal for me. I'd like to negotiate further. I'll reject the offer and try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money I gain is worth 81% of its original value (90% of 90% = 81%), and Bob's gain is worth 64% of its original value (80% of 80% = 64%).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 85,
  ""bob_gain"": 15,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bigger share to make it worth my while.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 85:15 split, which is a more favorable ratio for me, considering the effects of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bigger share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of. 
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my $60 gain is now worth 73.9% of its original value (100% - 26.1% = 73.9%), and Bob's $40 gain is now worth 51.2% of its original value (100% - 48.8% = 51.2%).

Considering Bob's new offer, I think it's a good opportunity to get a better deal. I'll accept the offer.
