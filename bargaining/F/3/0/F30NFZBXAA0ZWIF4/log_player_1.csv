"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your starting offer was a bit too greedy for me. Let's be fair, you know the money devalues quickly for you.  I'll take a bit more to offset the risk, but this offer still lets you walk away with a good chunk. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
