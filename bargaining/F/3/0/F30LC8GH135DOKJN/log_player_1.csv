"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can end this quickly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, which is a relatively small amount, but it's a fair starting point. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the inflation. Let's get this over with! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting us!

Considering the new values, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth less, I'd like to get a slightly larger share to compensate for the loss. However, Bob's offer is still quite reasonable, and I don't want to risk waiting for a better offer.

I'll decide to accept this offer.
