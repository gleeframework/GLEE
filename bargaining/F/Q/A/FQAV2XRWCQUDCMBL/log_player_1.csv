Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, my turn. I'm proposing a deal where I get a bit more, but you still get a good chunk before inflation eats into it further. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous. Take this offer, it's better than what you offered me last round, and we both lose more with each rejection. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  The longer the game goes on, the less the $100 is worth to both of us. However, the rate of depreciation is much faster for Bob. 
* **Bob's Desperation:** Bob's message indicates increasing desperation. He's likely realizing that holding out for a drastically better deal isn't realistic. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Rejecting this offer and hoping for a significantly better deal in Round 5 is incredibly risky. There's a good chance Bob will propose an even less favorable split, and the value will continue to plummet.

Accepting the 45/55 split now secures a reasonable amount before the effects of inflation make it significantly worse."
