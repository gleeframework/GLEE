Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. We both get a fair share, and it avoids the risk of the money depreciating further. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{
