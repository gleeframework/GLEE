"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
``` 

I'm going to start with a very simple offer, giving Bob a small portion. This lets me see how he's feeling and whether he's willing to negotiate. Since we don't know how inflation affects him, it's safer to start with a more favorable offer for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation situation. I'm going to reject his offer and see if he's willing to negotiate in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7200, ""bob_gain"": 2800}
```

I'm going to lower my offer slightly, but still keep a large share for myself.  The inflation is working in my favor, but I don't want to be too greedy."
