Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm aiming for a more balanced split this time, Alice.  Let's close this deal and both benefit. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5800,
""bob_gain"": 4200,
""message"": ""Bob, the clock is ticking and inflation is eating our potential gains. My offer is still generous, let's be reasonable.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close to a deal.  This offer reflects the time pressure and recognizes the shrinking value for both of us.  Let's wrap this up. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is steadily increasing his demands while taking advantage of the shrinking pot for me. Accepting now would mean settling for significantly less than what I aimed for initially. I need to push back firmly, even if it means risking a worse outcome later."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, this is a fair offer considering the time constraint. Let's end this now and avoid further losses.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer. It's getting risky for both of us.  Let's be practical and take what's still on the table. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**  The value of the deal for me is decreasing rapidly with each passing round. Bob is holding firm at 6000 for himself, and it's unlikely he'll go lower. Accepting this offer, while far from ideal, is better than risking getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
