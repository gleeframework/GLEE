"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept and we can split the million""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but it's a straightforward split. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 90% and you get 10% 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not a very generous offer from Bob!

I'll reject his offer. It's not worth it for me to take only 10% of the money, considering the value of the money is decreasing with each round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less now due to inflation, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me halfway, Bob!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still aiming to get a slightly larger share. Let's see if Bob will accept this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 80% and you get 20% 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob is trying to take a larger share again!

I'll reject his offer. The value of the money is decreasing rapidly due to inflation, and I don't want to give up 80% of the remaining value.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now, so I'll try to get a better deal. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me halfway, Bob, before it's too late!""
}
```

I'm trying to get a bit more than half, but I'm still willing to compromise. Let's see if Bob will accept this time!"
