9000.0,1000.0,"Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take 9000, and you get 1000. What do you think?",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Alice, that's a very generous offer for yourself, but hardly fair to me. How about we go 60/40?  Think it over carefully, time is money! ",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
6000.0,4000.0,"Bob, I'm willing to compromise, but 60/40 is still too much in your favor. Let's meet in the middle at 60/40, and we can both get a decent amount. Time is money, but so is fairness.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, we're running out of time. 55/45 is my final offer.  You're losing value much faster than I am, so take this deal while you still can!",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Bob, we're both losing money with each round. Let's split the difference and go for a 50/50 split. It's the fairest option at this point, and we can both walk away with something.  What do you say?",Alice,5,
