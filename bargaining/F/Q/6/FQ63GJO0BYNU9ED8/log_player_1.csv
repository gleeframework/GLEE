"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take 60% and you take 40%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable for a starting point. Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but you'll still get a decent chunk 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think 30% is too low for me, considering the initial offer was 60%. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal. Your turn, Bob!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more than 30%. Let's meet in the middle at 45-55.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my proposal to a 45-55 split, which is closer to the initial 60-40 split I proposed, but still leaves room for Bob to take a larger share. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I still think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is eating away at my potential gains!

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. With the inflation, the $200,000 I'd gain in this round is equivalent to only about $145,000 in the first round, which is a pretty paltry sum. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal. Your turn, Bob!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, Bob. Let's try 42-58, and see if we can finally reach an agreement.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my proposal to a 42-58 split, which is a bit closer to the 45-55 split I proposed earlier, but still leaves room for Bob to take a larger share. Your turn, Bob!"
