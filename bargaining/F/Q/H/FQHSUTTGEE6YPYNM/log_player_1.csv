Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be more equitable. A 60/40 split seems fairer. We have 10 rounds left, so let's work towards a mutually beneficial outcome. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
