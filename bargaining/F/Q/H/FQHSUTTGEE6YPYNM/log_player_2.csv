"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share, but you get a nice starting point. We can work out a more even split later. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While 100,000$ is a decent starting point, it's still a very uneven split. I want to see if we can negotiate a fairer deal.  I'm willing to risk a round to try and get a better share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
