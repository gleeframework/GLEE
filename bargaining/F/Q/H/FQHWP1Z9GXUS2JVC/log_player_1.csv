"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more. Inflation isn't affecting me, so I can wait. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly trying to exploit the inflation mechanic to his advantage.  While he claims to be willing to compromise, his offers have barely budged while my potential gains are significantly eroding. It's crucial to show him I'm willing to wait for a fairer deal, even with the inflation penalty."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Let's split it evenly and call it a day.  Any more delays and the inflation will eat into both our shares.""}"
