"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, but I'll give you a slightly larger share as a gesture of goodwill.""
}
```

This offer gives me $6,000 and Bob $4,000, which is a 60-40 split. I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fair, considering the inflation we're facing. Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the money is worth less, and Bob's offer is a 55-45 split, which is even more favorable to him than before.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal for myself.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, and I'll take that into account when making my offer.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4800,
  ""bob_gain"": 5200,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway on the split, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share due to the initial proposal I made.""
}
```"
