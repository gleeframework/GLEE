Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm being generous with 42 for you.

# Alice gain: 58

Round 4

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're getting anxious, but I still need a bigger share. 57/43 is my best offer yet. 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Even though the value is decreasing rapidly, accepting 43 dollars now is a terrible deal for Bob. Alice clearly understands the impact of inflation on Bob's decision-making and is taking advantage to maximize her gains. Bob needs to hold out for a better offer, even if it means risking getting nothing. There's a chance Alice will become more reasonable as the rounds progress and the threat of both getting nothing increases."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand you want a larger share, but the inflation is eating away at my gains. This is becoming a losing proposition for me. I need you to be reasonable. Let's split 60/40 and end this.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're getting desperate, but I'm not backing down. My offer is still better than what you've proposed so far. 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision, but time is running out. While 44 dollars is significantly less than what Bob wanted initially, rejecting this offer means risking an even worse deal in later rounds. The inflation is becoming critical, and Bob has to acknowledge that Alice is holding a stronger position. Accepting now guarantees him something rather than risking getting nothing at all if the game goes to the final round."
