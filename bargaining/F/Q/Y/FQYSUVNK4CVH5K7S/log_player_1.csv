Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}

I'm going to start with a very lopsided offer. This is to try and get Bob to accept quickly, as every round decreases the value of the money for him more than it does for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999990, ""bob_gain"": 10}

Bob is still offering a very lopsided deal, and while the inflation is starting to hurt him, I'm still in a good position. I'll continue to reject his offers until he gets more reasonable."

Round 5

```

I'm continuing to increase my offer slightly, but I'm still pushing for a deal that is heavily in my favor. I'm aware that the inflation rate is starting to hurt Bob, and I want to see if I can capitalize on that by getting him to accept a deal that is still very advantageous to me."

# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob is still offering a deal that heavily favors him. Inflation is starting to affect him more and more, but I'm still holding out for a better deal. I believe I can get a more equitable split, even if it means going a few more rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}
```

I'm increasing my offer significantly this round. The inflation is really hitting Bob hard, and I want to test the waters and see if I can push him into a deal that is closer to 50/50."

Round 10
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is still very lopsided, even though the inflation is hitting him hard. I'm still in a relatively strong position, and I want to see if I can push him into an even more equitable split. I'm not ready to settle for something so unequal yet."

Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm increasing my offer again, but this time, I'm offering a significantly larger share to Bob.  Inflation is now heavily impacting him, and I believe this offer is close enough to a 50/50 split that he'll be compelled to accept.  With only two rounds remaining, the value of the money for both of us is rapidly diminishing."
