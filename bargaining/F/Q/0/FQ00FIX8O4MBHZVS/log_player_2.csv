"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money 3:1. This way, we both get a fair share, with you receiving a smaller but still substantial amount. 
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While this offer is tempting, it's best to see if a better deal can be reached by rejecting the offer. There's no guarantee Alice will offer a better split in the next round, but the potential for a larger gain is worth the risk."
