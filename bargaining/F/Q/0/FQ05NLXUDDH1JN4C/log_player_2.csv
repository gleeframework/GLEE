Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You should consider accepting, the inflation is taking its toll. 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a tough spot. Let's analyze:

* **The Offer:** Alice offers me $3800, keeping $6200 for herself.
* **Inflation:**  The value of my potential gain has decreased significantly. Getting $3800 now is much worse than getting $4000 in Round 1.
* **Next Round:** If I reject, there's no guarantee I can get a better deal in Round 6. Alice knows the inflation is hurting me and might push for an even smaller share.

**Conclusion:** While it's significantly less than I aimed for, accepting avoids the risk of getting even less in the next round.  It's a bitter pill to swallow, but the best choice in this situation.
