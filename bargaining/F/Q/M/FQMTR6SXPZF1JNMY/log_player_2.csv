Let's see if I can get a better deal!  I'm not sure I'm ready to accept a 60/40 split just yet."

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still not convinced that 5800 for Alice and 4200 for me is fair, even with inflation considered.  It seems like Alice is still trying to get a much larger share. Let's see if we can reach a more balanced agreement."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is getting increasingly unfair.  It's clear she's trying to take advantage of the inflation.  I'm still willing to negotiate, but I won't accept such a lopsided deal."

Round 6

# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is getting ridiculous! Alice's offers are becoming more and more unfair. I'm not going to accept a deal where I get less than 4000. I'm starting to think Alice might be trying to drive me into a corner.  We need to reach a compromise."
