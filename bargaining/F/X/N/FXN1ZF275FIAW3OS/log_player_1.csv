"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, but I'll take a slightly bigger share""}

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. I'm framing it as a ""generous"" offer, but in reality, I'm trying to take a slightly bigger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fair, given that I'm taking the risk of this offer being rejected. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 55/45 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Since the money is worth 10% less than before, I'm thinking about the future and not just the immediate gain.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
