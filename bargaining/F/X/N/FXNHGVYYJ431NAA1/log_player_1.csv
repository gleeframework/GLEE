Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want a larger share, but that offer isn't fair to me. I propose a 55/45 split.  It benefits us both to settle this round before inflation eats away at the value. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
