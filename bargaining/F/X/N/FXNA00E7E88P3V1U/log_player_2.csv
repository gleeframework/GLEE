# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I want to see if I can get a better deal."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think a more even split is fair, given the inflation we'll both experience. This way, we both get more money in the long run.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise.  Let's split it closer to even, but I still need a bit more to account for the inflation impacting me more. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
It's getting risky with the inflation and I think this is a reasonable compromise."
