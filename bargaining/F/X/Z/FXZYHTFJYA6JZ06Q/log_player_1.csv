"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! Take 20% and we can call it a day.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $200,000. I'm keeping the remaining 80% for myself, which is $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, I'll give you a decent offer 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","In the second round, the money is worth 10% less for me, so my gain of $800,000 is now worth $720,000.

Bob's offer is $300,000 for me and $700,000 for him. I'll accept this offer, as it's a better deal than what I had initially offered.
