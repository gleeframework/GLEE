Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not intimidated by your ticking clock, let's make a deal that's actually fair. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000

```

At this point, the effects of inflation are starting to really hurt. While Alice's offer isn't ideal, consider this:

* **Round 5, Alice's offer:** Bob gets $440,000 (worth only $183,936 of the original value due to inflation).
* **Potential Round 6, Best Case Scenario:**  Even if Bob could get Alice to agree to a 50/50 split in the next round, he'd be getting $500,000 (worth only $160,000 of the original value due to inflation).

Waiting any longer will likely result in Bob getting even less of the original value. Accepting now cuts Bob's losses.
