"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 90/10.  I'll take the bigger share since I'm the one proposing, but it's still a fair deal.  Let's get this over with quickly! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see if I can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I think 55/45 is a much fairer split. Let's avoid any more rounds and get this done.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I'll take 60%, but this is my final offer.  I'm willing to be more flexible than Bob, but I'm not going any lower than this. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though I'd prefer a more even split, accepting Alice's offer is the best option here.  If I reject, I'll have to make a new offer, and with each round, the money I get will be worth less due to inflation."
