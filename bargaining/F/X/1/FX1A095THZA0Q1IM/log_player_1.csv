"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 70-30, a fair deal!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the money, which is a generous offer considering the current value of the money will decrease with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Split it down the middle, no need to negotiate! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'm not sure if splitting it down the middle is the best option for me.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the decreasing value of money, I'll try to negotiate a better deal for myself. Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll aim for a higher percentage.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 45, but I need 55 to make it worth my while.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting greedy, I'll take 60 and leave you with 40 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing rapidly! I need to think carefully about this offer.

Considering the significant decrease in the value of the money, I'm not sure if I want to accept an offer that leaves me with only 40. I'd rather try to negotiate further to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The value of money is decreasing rapidly, and I need to be more aggressive in my proposal.

Considering the significant decrease in the value of the money, I'll aim for a higher percentage to compensate for the loss.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 40, but I need 60 to make it worth my while, even with the inflation.""
