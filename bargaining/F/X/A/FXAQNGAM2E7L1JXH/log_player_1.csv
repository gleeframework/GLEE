"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and get this over with!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving us both $500,000 each."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll meet you in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since Bob's offer is 40% to me and 60% to him, I'm not thrilled about the uneven split. However, I also don't want to risk losing more money by rejecting this offer and going to the next round.

I'll accept this offer for now, hoping that Bob will make a more favorable offer in the next round.
