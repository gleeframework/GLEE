"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose taking $99 and giving Bob $1. This is a pretty standard opening move in this kind of game, as it shows Bob that I'm willing to be fair (at least relatively) while maximizing my own potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It's a fair offer, and I'm happy to split the money evenly with Bob. Better to get something than risk getting nothing!"
