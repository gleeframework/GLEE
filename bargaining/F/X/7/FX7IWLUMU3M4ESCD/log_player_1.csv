"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm starting strong, but I'm willing to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a good chunk, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 20% less for me, so I'm looking at $480,000 in Alice_gain, and $840,000 in Bob_gain.

I'm not too thrilled about the offer, but I don't want to risk going into the next round with less money. I'll accept Bob's offer.
