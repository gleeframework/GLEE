Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I propose a 50/50 split.  I think a fair and equal division is the best way to ensure a positive outcome for both of us."

Round 4

Bob's offer:

# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would prefer a more even split, I'm starting to feel the pressure of inflation.  Accepting this offer gives me something, and it's better than risking getting nothing at all."
