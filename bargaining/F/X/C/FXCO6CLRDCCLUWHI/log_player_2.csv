"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share, but you still get a decent amount. Accept this and we're done.  
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nWait, that's not fair at all! I'm not going to accept such a one-sided proposal. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round.\n\n###\n\nPlease proceed to the next round. I'm ready to make my proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a more reasonable offer. Here it is:\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and be fair. We both get a good amount, and we can walk away happy.""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn, Alice!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise a little more, but I need a larger share. This is my final offer, or we'll be stuck in this cycle forever. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not going to accept this offer. Even though the money is worth less to me now, I believe we can still find a more balanced division. Let's proceed to the next round.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me make another proposal. I'll try to find a compromise that suits both of us.\n\n###\n\nAlso, please let me know the current worth of the money for me after the 19% decrease in value. This will help me make a more informed decision in my next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nConsidering the current situation and the devaluation of the money for me, I'll make an adjusted offer. Since the money is now worth 19% less to me, I'll have to take that into account when making my proposal.\n\n###\n\nLet's calculate the current value of the money for me: 10,000$ * 0.81 (1 - 0.19) = 8100$. I'll keep this in mind when making my offer.\n\n###\n\nHere's my proposal:\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 4050, ""alice_gain"": 5950, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I've made an adjusted offer. This way, we both get a relatively fair share, taking into account the devalued money on my end.""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn, Alice!"
