"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and get it over with!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give you everything! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer. I was hoping for a more even split, and this offer is quite lopsided. I'm willing to negotiate further to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'll meet you halfway between our previous offers. Let's try to find a middle ground!""}

I'm trying to find a compromise by offering a slightly more favorable split to myself, while still being reasonable and willing to meet Bob halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of! 
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

After considering Bob's offer, I think I've reached a point where I'm willing to accept a slightly less favorable split. The offer is still not ideal, but it's getting closer to a reasonable compromise. I'm willing to take the 5800 and call it a day."
