"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This is a classic negotiation scenario. I'm going to offer Bob a relatively small portion to see if he's willing to accept it early on, knowing the money will lose value with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, it's better to take the 6000 now than risk getting nothing in later rounds. The inflation will continue to eat away at the value, and Bob seems willing to negotiate."
