"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced values, my share of $500,000 is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so it's $450,000 in today's value. Bob's share of $500,000 is now worth 95% of what it was in the first round, so it's $475,000 in today's value.

I'll accept this offer.
