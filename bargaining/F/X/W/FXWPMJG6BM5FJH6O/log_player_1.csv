"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}

I'm offering you $400,000, and I'll take $600,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less, the actual amounts are $500,000 for me and $500,000 for Bob, which is $200,000 less than the initial $1,000,000.

I'll accept this offer.
