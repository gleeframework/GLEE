"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and start with 60-40""}\n\n### AI: Round 1\n\nI have proposed a division where I receive $600,000 and Bob receives $400,000, with the message ""Let's be fair and start with 60-40"". This is a reasonable starting point, considering the impact of inflation in subsequent rounds. I am slightly biased towards myself to account for the higher rate of inflation I face, but still offer Bob a significant share to encourage acceptance and avoid further devaluation of the money. The message aims to set a tone of fairness and cooperation, while also establishing my position in the negotiation. I await Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script - I'll take 60% this time, and you can have 40%.  We can work out a fairer split later on if we both keep playing. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","### AI: Round 2\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject Bob's offer. Although the money's value has decreased due to inflation, accepting 40% of the now less valuable total does not align with my initial strategy of maintaining a higher share to compensate for the higher inflation rate I face. By rejecting, I aim to push for a more favorable division in the next round or force Bob to reconsider with a better offer. The game's early stage and the significant remaining rounds provide room for negotiation and adjustment."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","### AI: Round 3\n\n{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to adjust, but let's keep it reasonable.""}\n\nIn this round, I propose a division slightly more favorable to Bob than my initial offer, but still maintaining a higher share for myself. This adjustment acknowledges the devaluation of money due to inflation and aims to appear more conciliatory, while not significantly compromising my position. The message conveys a willingness to negotiate and adapt, encouraging Bob to consider the offer seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a 50/50 split. It's fair considering the inflation, and we can both walk away with something substantial. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","### AI: Round 4\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI accept Bob's offer of a 50/50 split. Given the significant impact of inflation on the value of the money, particularly for me, and considering we are already in the fourth round, securing half of the remaining value is a prudent decision. The offer is fair, as Bob suggests, and continuing to negotiate risks further devaluation of the money, potentially leading to a less favorable outcome. By accepting this offer, I ensure a substantial gain, albeit less than initially hoped for, and conclude the game in a relatively favorable position."
