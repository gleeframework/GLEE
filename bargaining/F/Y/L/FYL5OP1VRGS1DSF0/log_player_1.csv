"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to be generous, Alice, but that was a bit low. Let's be reasonable - this offer saves you a lot of depreciation. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
