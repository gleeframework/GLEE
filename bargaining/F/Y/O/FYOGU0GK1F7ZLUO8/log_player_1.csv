"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer, Bob! Take 2,000 and let's split the rest.""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob a decent amount to get him on board, and I'll get the majority of the money to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can find a more equitable split. Let's start with 6000 for me and 4000 for you.  We can negotiate further if you'd like. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less now, I'll have to adjust my gain accordingly.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's still a bit too generous for you, Bob! I'd like to propose a more balanced split.""
}
```

I'll make my next offer, taking into account the reduced value of the money due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer, considering the 10% inflation:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3200,
  ""bob_gain"": 6800,
  ""message"": ""Let's compromise, Bob. I'll take 3,200 and leave you with 7,800. We can try to find a better split later.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my gain to account for the reduced value of the money, but still trying to keep a decent amount for myself."
