Round 5

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, it's still beneficial for me to hold out a bit longer and aim for a better outcome.  There's still time, and conceding now might signal that I'm willing to accept a less favorable deal."

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to go a bit lower, but this is as low as I'll go. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** This is a tough decision, as it's not the ideal split I was hoping for. However, Alice has indicated this is her lower limit.  Considering we're past the halfway point, and risking getting $0, accepting a 45/55 split is a reasonable compromise to ensure we both walk away with something."
