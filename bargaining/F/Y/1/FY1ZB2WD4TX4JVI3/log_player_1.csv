"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fair. This offer gives you a good share, and it's better than nothing if we run out of rounds. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
