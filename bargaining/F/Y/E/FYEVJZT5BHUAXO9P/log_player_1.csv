{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, it's a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 equally, with each of us getting $5,000."

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not too thrilled about Bob taking a slightly bigger share, especially since the money is worth less for him due to inflation. I'd like to negotiate further to get a better deal."
