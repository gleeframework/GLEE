Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a high percentage for myself, but leaving Bob with a small amount to incentivize him to accept.  We'll see how it goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more, this is a significant gain for me.  The inflation means that each round is riskier, and I'm not sure I can get a better deal in the next round.  Let's take it!"
