Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, let's meet in the middle 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a tough decision, but accepting is the right move for Bob:

* **Inflation:** The longer the game goes on, the less the money is worth. Accepting now cuts losses from further inflation.
* **Alice's Position:** Alice is unlikely to offer much better. She started high, and this offer is a concession, even if slight, due to inflation.
* **Future Uncertainty:** There's no guarantee Bob can secure a better deal in subsequent rounds. Alice might become even more demanding.

While not ideal, 42% is better than risking further devaluation by holding out for a slightly larger share that might never materialize."
