"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. Take 10% and we'll call it a day! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This is a terrible offer for Bob. He should definitely reject it and see what Alice offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split this evenly, Alice.  It's the fairest way to go!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give up a little more, Bob.  But I need a larger share to make it worthwhile for me. Let's call it a day at 60/40. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While it's tempting to keep rejecting, the inflation rate is starting to hit hard.  Accepting this offer gets Bob a decent amount of money, and there's no guarantee Alice will offer more in the next round."
