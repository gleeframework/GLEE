"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split it 60-40. I'm willing to take a bigger share since I made the first offer. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
Let's see what Alice offers next!  I think I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I think a 55-45 split is fairer, considering the value of the money will decrease with each round. Let's make a deal!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my new offer is a bit more generous than before. Take it before the money loses more value! 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While a 42-58 split isn't ideal, the inflation is becoming a real problem. It's better to accept and get something than risk losing more in the next round."
