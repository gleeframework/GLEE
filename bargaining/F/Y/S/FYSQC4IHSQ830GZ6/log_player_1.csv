"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! I'll give you a fair share, but I'm hoping to negotiate for more in future rounds.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small share, in hopes that he'll accept and we can start the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly. No need to play games with this much money at stake. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth less now, and Bob's offer seems reasonable. I'll accept this offer.
