"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I receive 60% of the initial $10,000, which is $6,000, and Bob receives 40%, which is $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm happy to go 60-40, but I think it's fairer if I get the bigger share this time. Let's see what you think! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob getting the bigger share, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my thinking.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now, hoping to make a better proposal in the next round. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
