"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself, which is a 20% share for Bob and 80% for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to start. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $8,000 in the first round is now worth $7,600.

Considering Bob's new offer, I think a 50/50 split is a fairer option than my initial proposal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I accept Bob's offer, and we'll split the money 50/50."
