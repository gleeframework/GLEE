"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very high offer for myself, leaving Bob with a tiny amount. This is a strategic move to see if Bob will be willing to accept a small amount to avoid getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This offer is fair, and it's better than risking getting nothing if I reject it.  Let's take the 500,000!"
