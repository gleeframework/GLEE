"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's better than nothing, I want to see if I can get a better deal. I'm hoping Alice will be more willing to compromise as the rounds go on."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}
``` 

I'm going to propose a 50/50 split. This seems fair, and it's likely Alice will be more willing to accept a more equitable division as we approach the final rounds."
