Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

Let's see if Bob is a fair player.  I'm going to give him a small share to see if he's willing to take it or wants to try and get more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, it's better to take the 5000$ than risk getting nothing in the end. Inflation is a serious factor here, and I don't want to be left with nothing."
