"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a generous offer to Bob. This will hopefully incentivize him to accept quickly, before inflation kicks in too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject this offer.  While I'm losing value due to inflation, I still believe I can get a better deal in future rounds. Bob is being very greedy right now, and I think I can convince him to share more fairly."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm increasing my offer to Bob slightly, but still keeping the majority for myself. I'm hoping this shows him that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I won't be taken advantage of."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse, but I'm still holding out for a better deal. The inflation is hitting me hard, but I believe I can still get a larger share if I hold firm.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

Inflation is really hurting me now. I'm going to try to make a compromise and split the money evenly. This is probably the best I can do at this point, given how the rounds are progressing. Hopefully, Bob sees the value in settling and accepting this offer."
