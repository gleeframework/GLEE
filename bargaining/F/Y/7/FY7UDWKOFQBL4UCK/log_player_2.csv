"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair! I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. This seems like a good starting point, what do you think? 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While it's tempting to start fair, it's worth remembering that the money loses value with each round.  It's better to see what Alice offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 51, ""alice_gain"": 49, ""message"": ""I think a 51/49 split is more fair, given the money loses value each round. Let's start with that, and we can adjust later.""}
