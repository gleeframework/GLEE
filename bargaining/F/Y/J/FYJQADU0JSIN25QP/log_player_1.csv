"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further""
}
```

This is a straightforward offer, suggesting that we split the $10,000 equally between us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give away too much 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer.

Since the money is worth 5% less for me, I'll evaluate the offer in terms of the original amount.

If I accept Bob's offer, I'll get 4000 dollars, which is 40% of the original 10,000 dollars. This seems like a reasonable offer, but I'm not sure if I should accept it.

I'll reject the offer and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll make a counteroffer: 4200 for me, 5800 for you""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""My counteroffer from last round remains, but I'm willing to negotiate further""
}
```

This offer is the same as my counteroffer from round 2, with a slight emphasis on being open to further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effects of inflation, the money is worth significantly less for me now.

In terms of the original amount, I'll get 3500 dollars, which is 35% of the original 10,000 dollars. This seems like a reasonable offer, but I'm not sure if I should accept it.

I'll reject the offer and make another counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll make another counteroffer: 3600 for me, 6400 for you""

  ""message"": ""I'm getting closer to what I want, but I'm still willing to negotiate further""
}
```

This offer is my counteroffer from round 4, with a message indicating that I'm still open to further negotiation."

# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are starting to take a toll on the money's value.

In terms of the original amount, I'll get 3000 dollars, which is 30% of the original 10,000 dollars. This is a relatively small share, but I'm not sure if I should accept it.

I'll reject the offer and make another counteroffer.
