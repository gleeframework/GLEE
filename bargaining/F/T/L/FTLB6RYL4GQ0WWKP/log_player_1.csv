"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing to take 60 dollars and leave 40 dollars for Bob. I think this is a good starting point, and it's a fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we should split it 60-40, with me getting the larger share this time.  Let's be fair to each other! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not going to accept Bob's offer! I think it's a bit too one-sided, and I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal this time. Let's try 55-45 and see if we can make a deal!""}

I'm willing to compromise and give Bob a slightly larger share this time, but I'm still trying to get a decent amount for myself."
