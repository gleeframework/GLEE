Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal this time. Let's try 55-45 and see if we can make a deal! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'm going to accept this offer. While it's not ideal, inflation is kicking in, and I don't want to risk losing more."
