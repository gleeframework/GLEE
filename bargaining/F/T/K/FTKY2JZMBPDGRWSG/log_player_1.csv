"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start to the game!""

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted 50/50, I'll give you 60/40, is that fair? 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's trying to negotiate a better deal for himself, eh?

I'll think about it... If I accept this offer, I'll get $400,000, which is worth 95% of the original $500,000 I proposed in the first round. That's not bad, but I was hoping for a more even split.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.
