Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's try this again.  My offer is still generous considering the inflation is hitting you harder.

# Alice gain: 65

Round 4

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the inflation is making this difficult, but a 50/50 split isn't fair given how much faster the money is losing value for you. This is my final offer.

# Alice gain: 60

It's getting very risky to keep rejecting offers. While not ideal, accepting a 40/60 split now avoids the risk of getting nothing if the game continues and gives a somewhat reasonable payout."
