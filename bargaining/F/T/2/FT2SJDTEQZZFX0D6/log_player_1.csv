Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fairer considering the inflation risk is shared. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to a 50/50 split, it still favors him significantly considering the inflation difference. I believe we can find a more balanced solution."
