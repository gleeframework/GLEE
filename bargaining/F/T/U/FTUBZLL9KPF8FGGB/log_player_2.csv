"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn to decide! 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While a 30/70 split seems fair on the surface, it's important to consider the inflation factor. Since the money is worth less with each round, it's in my best interest to try and get a better deal. I'll reject and see what Alice offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think a more even split is fair, considering the money will lose value in the next rounds. Let's split it 55/45. What do you think?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle and make it a 50/50 split. No more negotiating, just a fair split. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a slightly better deal, it's important to remember that the money loses value each round.  Accepting a 50/50 split is the best option at this point, as any further negotiation risks getting nothing."
