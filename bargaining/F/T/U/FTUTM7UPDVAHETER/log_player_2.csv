Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 700000

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic.  Time is running out, and the value is shrinking for you. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is trying to leverage the time pressure and inflation against me. While the deal is getting worse, accepting now would mean I lose a significant chunk of the initial potential gain. I need to hold out a little longer and hope Alice gets more willing to compromise."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is a final offer: a straight 50/50 split.  It's the fairest deal and avoids further losses due to inflation.  Let's end this now.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  

At this stage, a firm stance is necessary.  Alice is clearly employing a strategy of wearing Bob down. By offering a 50/50 split:

* **Simplicity and Fairness:** It's easy to understand and removes any argument about who's getting a better deal.
* **Time Pressure:**  The message emphasizes the urgency and the fact that further delays only hurt both players.
* **Possible Shift in Alice's Strategy:** Facing a firm and fair offer, Alice might be more inclined to accept rather than risk the decreasing value in later rounds."
