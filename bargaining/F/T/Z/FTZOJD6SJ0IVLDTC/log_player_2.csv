Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's call it even.  Since we both rejected each other's first offers, I propose a 50/50 split. This is the fairest way to move forward, considering the diminishing value of the money. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
