"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, as it's a fair and simple way to start the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but still want a bit more for myself 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better. I was initially willing to accept a 50/50 split, and now Bob is offering me only 40% of the total amount. I'll wait for his next offer to see if he's willing to compromise further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I still think I deserve a slightly larger share""}

I'm increasing my initial offer by $500, hoping that Bob will be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I still think I deserve a bigger share, considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While he's giving me a bit more than his previous offer, I still think I'm being offered too little. Considering the initial 50/50 split, I'm not willing to accept a 48/52 split, especially with inflation affecting the value of the money. I'll wait for his next offer to see if he's willing to compromise further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise considering the current value of the money""}

I'm increasing my previous offer by $500, trying to find a middle ground that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I still think I deserve a bit more, considering the inflation has affected me more 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm accepting Bob's offer. Although I was hoping for a better deal, I think this is a reasonable compromise considering the effects of inflation. I'm getting a slightly larger share than in his previous offer, and I'm willing to accept it to avoid further negotiations and potential losses due to inflation."
