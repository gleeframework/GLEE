700000.0,300000.0,I propose we divide the money 700000 for me and 300000 for you. Let's make the most of our shares before the value decreases.,Alice,1,

400000.0,600000.0,"You're being generous with your initial offer, but I think I can do better. Let's see if you can match this!",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Considering the decrease in value, I propose an equal split of $500,000 each. This ensures fairness while maximizing our shares before further inflation.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"I'm not convinced that an equal split is the best option. I'm willing to offer you a slightly smaller share, but I think it's a fair compromise given the current market conditions.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
480000.0,520000.0,"Considering the decreasing value of money, I propose a division where you receive $520,000 and I receive $480,000. This maintains a reasonable difference while still being fair given the inflationary pressures.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
420000.0,580000.0,"I'm starting to think you're trying to lowball me. I'm willing to offer you a slightly larger share, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the risks I'm taking.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
470000.0,530000.0,"Given the inflationary situation, I propose a division where you receive $530,000 and I receive $470,000. This aims to balance fairness with the need to maximize our respective shares.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"I'm starting to run out of patience. I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to give away the farm. Meet me at 600k and we can call it a day.",Bob,8,
