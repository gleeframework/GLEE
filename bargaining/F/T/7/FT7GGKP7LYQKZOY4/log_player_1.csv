"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This way, we both get a significant amount of money, and I'm showing Bob that I'm willing to compromise. Now it's his turn!"

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the inflation continuing to erode my potential gains, I'll need to be more aggressive in my proposal. Here's my new offer:

{

  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
