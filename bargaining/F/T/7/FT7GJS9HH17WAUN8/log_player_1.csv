"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money, I'll have to adjust my decision. Since the money is worth 20% less for me, I'll consider the actual value of the gains as follows:

My gain: 450,000 * 0.8 = 360,000 (due to 20% inflation)
Bob's gain: 550,000 * 0.9 = 495,000 (due to 10% inflation)

Considering the reduced values, I'll decide to reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me again, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000
}
```

This time, I'll aim to get a slightly larger share to compensate for the continued inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values of the gains, taking into account the cumulative inflation:

My gain: 480,000 * 0.512 (0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8) = 245,760
Bob's gain: 520,000 * 0.727 (0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9) = 378,240

Considering the reduced values, I'll decide to accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
