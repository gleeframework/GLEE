I'm starting with a fairly generous offer, hoping to secure a quick deal.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is a bit too extreme for me. I'll counter in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm lowering my share a bit, but still offering a reasonable split.  Let's see if Bob is willing to compromise."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too high, and the inflation is starting to hit hard.  I'll try one more time to reach a compromise before the money becomes worthless."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm lowering my share again, but I'm still holding out for a more equitable split.  Hopefully, Bob is starting to realize the value of the money is declining rapidly."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too high, and the inflation is seriously impacting the value of the money. I'll try to make a final compromise in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm going for an even split in this round.  The inflation is becoming a major factor, and I don't want to risk losing everything.  Hopefully, Bob will see the sense in this and accept."
