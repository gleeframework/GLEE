This is a very simple offer. I'm trying to maximize my share, knowing that Bob will have to accept anything better than nothing in the next round. I'm assuming Bob won't be very good at this game yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer. Even though it's only a small increase in what Bob is offering me, the money is worth the same to me as it was in the previous round.  Bob is being too greedy, and I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

This is a 50/50 split.  I'm going to try to be more fair this time, hoping that Bob will realize it's in his best interest to accept this offer.  With each passing round, the value of the money he's losing is increasing significantly.  I'm also hoping to get a better deal for myself in the long run by building a more cooperative relationship."
