"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly. I'm happy to take a slight majority as I'm confident we can come to a better agreement later. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: I can potentially get a better offer in the next rounds, and the 20% decrease in value for me is a significant incentive to try and get more than 40. Since Alice is confident that we can come to a better agreement later, I'll take that as a sign that she's willing to negotiate and potentially give me a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a bit more than half since the money is worth less to me with each passing round. Let's settle on this and avoid further losses.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split this evenly. The inflation is hurting us both, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all. We can both get something out of this if we agree now. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: Although the money is worth significantly less to me now, and Alice is right that we're both losing value, accepting 50 at this point might still not be the best option. Since Alice is worried about getting nothing, I believe she might be willing to give me a slightly better offer in the next rounds to secure a deal. Additionally, the difference in how inflation affects us means Alice is losing less value than I am, so she might be more willing to negotiate further to avoid the risk of losing it all."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm taking a bit more to compensate for my losses. This is a fair offer given the circumstances, and I'm willing to settle on this to avoid further devaluation.""}"
