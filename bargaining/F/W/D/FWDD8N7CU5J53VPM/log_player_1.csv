"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a small difference, we can always negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but it's a starting point. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject my proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  This way we both get a fair share, and we can avoid the risk of inflation eating into our gains. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is quite reasonable, considering the risk of inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I accept Bob's offer, and we can split the $10,000 evenly."
