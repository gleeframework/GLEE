"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, it's a fair start""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is 20% of the original amount, and keeping $8,000 for myself, which is 80% of the original amount."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, let's be fair! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob has made a counteroffer. Here's my response:

```
{

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better. I'll wait for the next round to make a new proposal."
