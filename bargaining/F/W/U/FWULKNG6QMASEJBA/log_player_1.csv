I'm going to offer Bob $1 and keep $999,999 for myself.  Since inflation is a factor, it's in my best interest to get as much as possible in the first round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 501000 
# Bob gain: 499000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I would prefer to get more, accepting this offer ensures I get at least something.  With the 10% inflation, waiting for another round could result in a much lower payout for me."
