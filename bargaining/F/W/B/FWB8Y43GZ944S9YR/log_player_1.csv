"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can't have all the fun, let's make it 60-40 in my favor! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll have to adjust my expectations accordingly.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better deal.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60-40 in his favor, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's closer to 50-50, but still slightly in my favor to account for the inflation.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 52,
  ""bob_gain"": 48,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, but I'm not giving up too much""
}"
