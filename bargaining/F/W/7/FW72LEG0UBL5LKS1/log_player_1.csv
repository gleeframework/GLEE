"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This is a classic negotiation scenario, so I'm going to start by being fairly aggressive, keeping most of the money for myself.  This gives me a good starting point and allows me to see how Bob responds.  We'll adjust our strategy based on his actions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more, accepting this offer is the best strategy. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  Each round, the money is worth less. Accepting now ensures I get at least something, and I'm not guaranteed to get more if I reject and play another round.
* **Bob's Aggression:** Bob's offer shows he's not afraid to be aggressive, and he's likely to get even more demanding in future rounds.
* **Fair Share:** Even with inflation, 600,000 is a substantial amount, and it's likely better than what I would get if I keep rejecting and the game goes on.

Let's see if we can negotiate a better deal in the future, but for now, accepting is the safest move."
