  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and end the game quickly.""

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 400k, it's a good starting point, let's see if we can do better 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting this offer because I think I can do better than 400k. The game is still early, and I'd like to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm not going to go too low.""

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting this offer because I think I can do better than 480k. Bob's ""take it or leave it"" approach is a bit aggressive, and I'd like to try to squeeze out a bit more. I'm not sure if I'll get a better offer, but I'm willing to take the risk."
