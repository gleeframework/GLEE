"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that we divide the $1,000,000 equally, with each of us getting $500,000. This is a straightforward and fair offer, and I hope Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but still fair 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 20% decrease in my potential gain, but I'll consider Bob's offer.

After calculating the value of the proposed gains, I see that I'd get $400,000, which is worth $320,000 in the original value (due to inflation). Bob would get $600,000, which is worth $480,000 in the original value.

While I'm not thrilled about the unequal split, I'm willing to consider it. I'll accept Bob's offer for now, hoping to do better in future rounds.
