Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer was a bit too skewed for my liking. Let's be realistic - I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  It's a strong offer considering the inflation, and it allows us both to benefit sooner rather than later.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire for a bigger share, but I believe a 55/45 split is fairer.  Let's compromise to avoid further inflation and get a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000
