"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was a bit too skewed for my liking. Let's be realistic - I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  It's a strong offer considering the inflation, and it allows us both to benefit sooner rather than later. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
