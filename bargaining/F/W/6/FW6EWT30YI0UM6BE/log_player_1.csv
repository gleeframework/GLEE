"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable""
}
```

I'm offering to take 55% of the money, which I think is a fair starting point. The message ""Let's be reasonable"" is a gentle nudge to encourage Bob to accept this offer and avoid further rounds, which would lead to a decrease in the value of the money for him."

}

I'm increasing my share to 58%, taking into account that the money is worth the same to me, but 5% less to Bob in each subsequent round. The message is a subtle reminder to Bob that time is on my side, and it's better for him to accept this offer before the value of the money decreases further."
