Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm starting with a strong offer, giving myself the majority of the money.  I'm hoping Bob will be tempted to accept early to avoid the risk of inflation.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer more, it's a fair split, and I don't want to risk inflation eating away at my potential gains in future rounds."
