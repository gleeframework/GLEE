"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'll start by proposing a 90/10 split in my favor.  I want to get as much of the money as possible in the first round, as the inflation will make it worth less to me in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred my initial offer, accepting this 50/50 split is the best strategy. Inflation means my next offer will be worth significantly less, and there's a risk Bob won't accept any future proposals. This ensures I get at least half the money, which is better than nothing in the later rounds."
