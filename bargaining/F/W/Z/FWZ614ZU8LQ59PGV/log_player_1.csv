"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to start, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making a decision.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 20% less, I think this is a good opportunity for me to get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer in round 2 was 60-40, and the money is worth 20% less for him, I'll try to take advantage of that by offering a slightly better deal for myself.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth significantly less than in the previous round, I think this is a good opportunity for me to get a better deal.

However, I'm not sure if 45 is the best I can get, so I'll think carefully before making a decision.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer in round 4 was 55-45, and the money is worth even less for him now, I'll try to take advantage of that by offering an even better deal for myself.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the money Bob gains is worth significantly less now!

Considering that the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I think I should take advantage of Bob's decreasing bargaining power.
