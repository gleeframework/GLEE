"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I get a bit more since I'm losing value faster. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, Alice, but I'm losing value faster too. Let's find a compromise.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Time is running out, Bob. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While it's not ideal, accepting this offer is the best option.  With each round, the value of the money decreases, and there's no guarantee Alice will make a better offer.  By accepting, you at least secure a decent amount, even if it's less than you initially hoped for."
