Do you accept this offer?","```json

I reject this offer. It's too low, and I have plenty of rounds to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}
``` 

I propose a 50/50 split. This is a fair and reasonable offer, and it gives Alice a chance to avoid the risk of inflation in the next round."
