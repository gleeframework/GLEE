I'm starting with a proposal that gives me a large share of the money. I'm hoping Bob will accept it, as it's still a decent amount for him. I'm not overly worried about inflation yet, but I want to secure a large chunk early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer more, I don't want to risk getting nothing at all. Inflation is starting to become a factor, and 500,000 is still a significant amount. I'll take the guaranteed amount and move on."
