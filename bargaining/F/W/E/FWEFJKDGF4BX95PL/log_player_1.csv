"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

This means I'll take $6,000 and Bob will take $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about it. With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'd rather have a smaller amount now than risk going to the next round and facing even more inflation. I'll accept this offer.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
