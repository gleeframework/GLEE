"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}

This way, I get a decent chunk of the money, but still leave Bob with a fair share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, my initial offer would have been equivalent to 48 in the second round. Bob's offer is actually a 50-50 split, which is a fair one. I'll accept this offer.
