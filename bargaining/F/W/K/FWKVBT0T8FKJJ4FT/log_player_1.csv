"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. The message is a friendly suggestion to split the money 60-40, which is a fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slight adjustment from my side, still a fair split 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money has decreased due to inflation, so I'll have to be more careful with my decisions.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to reject it. I'd rather wait for a better offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreased value of the money due to inflation. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""A slight adjustment from my side, trying to meet you halfway""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $5,500 and keeping $4,500 for myself, trying to find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Getting closer, but I'm still hoping for a better split 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the increased inflation rate, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. I'll have to be more aggressive with my offers.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll reject it again. I think I can do better than this.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 5, I'll make another offer that takes into account the increased inflation rate. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need a better split""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,500 and keeping $5,500 for myself, trying to find a better balance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, let's settle for a 50-50 split 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","A 50-50 split is a fair offer, especially considering the rapid decrease in value due to inflation. I think it's a good idea to accept this offer and split the remaining $10,000 evenly.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
