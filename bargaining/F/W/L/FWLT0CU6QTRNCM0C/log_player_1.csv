I'm going for a classic ""take it or leave it"" approach.  Let's see if Bob thinks it's worth risking losing almost everything to get a chance at proposing a better deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd love to keep playing and see if I can get more, the inflation is a serious threat. A 50/50 split is a fair outcome, and accepting it guarantees me a decent amount of money."
