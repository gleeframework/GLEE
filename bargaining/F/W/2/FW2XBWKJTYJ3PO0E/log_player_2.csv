"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire for a larger share, but a 65/35 split is still too unbalanced.  Let's compromise. I'll take 60% and you get 40%. This is a fair offer, given the inflation factor, and allows us to reach a resolution quickly. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000
