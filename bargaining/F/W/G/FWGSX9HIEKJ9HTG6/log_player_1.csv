"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair and reasonable start!""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me $6,000 and leaving $4,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'm not going to give you the majority! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'll consider it. Since my gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'm effectively getting $1,600 (2000 x 0.8). I'm not getting the majority, but it's better than nothing.
