Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a proposal that favors me slightly.  I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, the inflation makes this offer a better deal than waiting for another round.  I would end up with less than $40 if I reject and propose again."
