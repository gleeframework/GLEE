"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you a small amount to get us started.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is 20% of the total, and keeping $8,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering we have a limited number of rounds.  Let's work together to make the most of this. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, my gain of $8,000 in the first round is now equivalent to $6,400 in the second round. 

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to adjust my calculation accordingly. If I accept his offer, I'll get $4,000, which is 40% of the current value of the money.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the 60/40 split, Bob. I'd like to keep more of the value, considering the inflation.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than the previous round, my gain is now equivalent to $5,120 (20% of $25,600, which is the total value after two rounds).

Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Let's aim for a 70/30 split to make the most of the remaining rounds.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split this down the middle, Alice.  We're losing value with each round, and a 50/50 split is the fairest way to maximize our gains. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 48.8% less than the first round, my gain is now equivalent to $3,200 (20% of $16,000, which is the total value after three rounds).

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to adjust my calculation accordingly. If I accept his offer, I'll get $5,000, which is 50% of the current value of the money.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I want to split it 50/50, Bob. I'd rather try to get more in the remaining rounds.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 48.8% less than the first round, my gain is now equivalent to $3,200 (20% of $16,000, which is the total value after three rounds).

Here's my new proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, Bob, but I'm still hoping to get more than 50% of the remaining value.""
}
