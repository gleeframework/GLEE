This is a classic game theory problem with elements of risk and negotiation.  Since the money is decreasing in value with each round, it's not a good idea to accept an offer that gives you a tiny portion. It's better to see what kind of offers Alice is willing to make as the rounds go on."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 9000, ""alice_gain"": 1000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2800 
# Alice gain: 7200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While the offer is better than the first round, I am still confident that I can get a larger share.  With 9 rounds left, Alice's position is weaker than mine, and she needs to offer more to get me to agree."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 8000, ""alice_gain"": 2000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4240 
# Alice gain: 5760 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice is still trying to get a larger share, but the inflation is making her offers less appealing.  I'm going to hold out and see if she's willing to offer a larger share of the shrinking pie."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5392 
# Alice gain: 4608 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Alice's offer is getting closer to what I would ideally like.  With only 5 rounds left, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly.  It's likely that her next offer will be significantly worse.  At this point, it's more advantageous to accept and secure some of the remaining value."
