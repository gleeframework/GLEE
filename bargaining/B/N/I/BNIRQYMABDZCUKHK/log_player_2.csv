**Reasoning:**

Even though the money is shrinking, Alice's offers are getting worse for me.  I need to hold out for a better deal, but I need to be mindful of the quickly devaluing money."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Okay, Alice, let's stop this.  A 50/50 split is the fairest and we both need to take the deal before it shrinks even more.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's getting to the point where the inflation is hurting both of us badly.   Alice seems to be holding out for a slightly larger share, but it's not worth it anymore.  A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical offer at this point."
