Round 3

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bigger share to make it worthwhile with the inflation. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting this offer makes sense for Alice:

* **Time Pressure:** With each round, the value decreases for Bob, making reaching an agreement tougher. There are only 8 rounds left.
* **Decent Share:**  Alice is still getting a larger portion of the money. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a better offer risks Bob becoming increasingly desperate and offering even less favorable splits in the future."
