Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, let's meet in the middle, I'll take a bit less than before 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""This is getting ridiculous. Let's just split it evenly and call it a day.""

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Splitting evenly is nice, but I think I deserve a bit more. How about this? 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is stubbornly refusing to budge much. While the time pressure is on, accepting a bad deal just because of inflation is worse than getting $0.  I'll hold out for a bit longer and see if she gets nervous as we get closer to the deadline."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 52,
""alice_gain"": 48,
""message"": ""This is my final offer. Take it or leave it. The clock is ticking and we both lose if we don't agree.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  It's time to play hardball.  Alice needs to understand the urgency.  Offering a slightly better deal than before, while still favorable to me, might be enough to convince her before the inflation eats away too much of our potential gains."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Don't bluff, I know you're losing value each round. I'll give you a bit more than before, but that's it. 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  Alice is right, bluffing hasn't gotten me anywhere.  The longer this goes on, the worse my position becomes. Accepting a 44/56 split now is better than risking getting nothing in the end.  It's not ideal, but the relentless inflation makes it necessary to cut my losses."
