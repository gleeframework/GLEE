Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try to find a compromise 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to a more even split, time is running out.  It's still beneficial for me to hold out and hope for a better offer in the next round or two. The inflation is hurting Alice more than me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""This is a fair split.  Let's end this before we both lose more to inflation.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has consistently rejected offers where I get a larger share. Offering a 50/50 split is now the most strategic move. It signals fairness and minimizes potential losses for both of us due to inflation. It's unlikely I'll secure a better deal at this stage."
