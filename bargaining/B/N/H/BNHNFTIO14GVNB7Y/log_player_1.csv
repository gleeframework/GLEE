I'm going for a pretty aggressive first offer. Since the money is worth more to me than Bob, I want to maximize my share in the early rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is terrible, even considering the inflation.  I'll try to counter with something more favorable to me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm still aiming for a significant share, but I'm lowering my demand slightly to account for the inflation.  I'm hoping Bob will be more willing to accept a smaller share after seeing his offer rejected."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too unfavorable.  I'm going to keep rejecting until he makes a more reasonable proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm continuing to lower my demand, but still trying to secure a majority share. The inflation is starting to bite, but I'm hoping to reach a deal before it gets too extreme."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too lopsided in his favor.  The inflation is really starting to hit, but I'm not going to accept a deal that's this bad.  I'm hoping he realizes he needs to make a more even proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm lowering my demand again. The inflation is getting serious now, but I'm still hoping to get a decent share. I think a 60/40 split is reasonable considering the circumstances."
