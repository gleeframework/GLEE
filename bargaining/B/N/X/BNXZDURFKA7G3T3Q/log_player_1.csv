I'm starting with a strong offer, aiming for 90% of the money.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is a complete reversal of my initial proposal.  While I'm losing money due to inflation, I'm not going to accept such a drastic change in favor of Bob. I'll try to negotiate a more equitable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm lowering my initial demand slightly to 80%, but I'm still aiming for a significant share of the money.  Hopefully, Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise, considering the inflation that's impacting my share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still extremely unfavorable to me, especially with the inflation eating into my gains.  I'm not going to accept such a lopsided deal. It's time to make a stand and try to negotiate something fairer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm taking a bigger risk this time, but I believe it's necessary. Inflation is biting into my earnings, and Bob seems determined to exploit that.  I'm lowering my demand to 60%, hoping that Bob will finally see reason and accept a more equitable split."
