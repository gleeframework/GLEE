Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose to keep $9,000 for myself and give $1,000 to Bob.  This is a generous offer in my opinion, given that the money will be worth less in the next round.  I think it's in Bob's best interest to accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
 
I'll accept Bob's offer.  Even though the money is worth less now, I'd rather get $1,000 than risk getting nothing at all in the next round."
