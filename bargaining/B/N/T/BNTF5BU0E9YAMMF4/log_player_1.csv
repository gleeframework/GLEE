"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can seal the deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, and I need to be strategic.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I want to give you half. Can you offer something better?""
}
```

I'm not accepting the even split, hoping that Bob will come back with a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, so I need to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 720000,
  ""bob_gain"": 280000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share this time. Accept and we can move on?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $280,000, which is a bit less than before, but still a decent chunk of the remaining money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger share to make it worth my while. Let's split it 60/40. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money! With the money being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I need to be even more careful with my decisions.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'm not thrilled about giving him 60% of the remaining money. However, I'm not sure if I can do better. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Okay, fine. You got a better deal this time. Let's seal the deal.""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's 60/40 split, hoping that I won't regret it later."
