"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, hoping to set a fair tone for the rest of the game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of 40 is now worth 0.95 x 40 = 38, and Bob's gain of 60 is now worth 0.9 x 60 = 54.

I'm not willing to accept this offer, as it's not a good deal for me. I'd rather try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much""
}
```

I'm trying to make a slightly more generous offer, while still trying to get a decent share for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 35, but I'm not going to give up too much more 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of 35 is now worth 0.855 (1 - 0.1446) x 35 = 30.1925, and Bob's gain of 65 is now worth 0.7273 x 65 = 47.2725.

I'm not willing to accept this offer, as it's still not a good deal for me. I'd rather try to negotiate further.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 42,
  ""bob_gain"": 58,

}
```

I'm trying to make a more balanced offer, but still holding firm on my share."
