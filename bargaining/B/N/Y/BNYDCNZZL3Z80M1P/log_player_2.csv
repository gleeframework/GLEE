""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this offer still gives you a considerable sum, and it accounts for the fact that the value decreases faster for me. Let's settle this now before inflation eats away at our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
