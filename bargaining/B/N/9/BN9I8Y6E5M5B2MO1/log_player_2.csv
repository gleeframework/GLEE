"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair division, I'll take the lion's share but you still get a good chunk! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While a 100,000$ gain is tempting, it's too early to settle. We have 12 rounds, and with inflation, I can potentially get a much better deal later on."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'm offering a more balanced split, considering the potential for inflation.  Let's be reasonable and end this quickly.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a larger share to make this worthwhile. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice is compromising, the offer is still too uneven. I can still try to negotiate a more balanced split, especially considering the inflation affecting my share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's cut this in half. We're both losing money with each passing round. It's time to be reasonable and end this before we both lose everything.""}
