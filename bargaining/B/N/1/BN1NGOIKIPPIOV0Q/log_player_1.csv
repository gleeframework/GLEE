"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself. I'm starting with a fair split, but I'm not giving away too much too quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm hoping for a better deal later on. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money I gain is still worth 600,000$, but the money Bob gains is worth 400,000$. Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, which is a good compromise. However, considering the inflation, I'm still gaining more than Bob. I'll accept this offer to avoid giving up more value in future rounds.
