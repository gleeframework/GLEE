"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Alice's offer was 400,000 for me and 600,000 for her, I'll try to do slightly better than that. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 420000, ""alice_gain"": 580000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer is 300,000 for me and 700,000 for her. Since my gain is worth the same as in the first round, and her gain is worth 19% less, I'll try to take advantage of this. Here's my thought process:

300,000 is still a decent offer, but 700,000 is worth less than 600,000 was in the first round. I'll try to get a bit more.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In the previous round, Alice's offer was 300,000 for me and 700,000 for her. Since her gain is worth 19% less than in the first round, and my gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll try to adjust my offer accordingly.

I'll aim to get a bit more than 300,000, considering the reduced value of Alice's offer. Here's my new offer:

{""bob_gain"": 320000, ""alice_gain"": 680000}"
