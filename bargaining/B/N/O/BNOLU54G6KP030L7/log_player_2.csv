Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your point about the inflation, but I need to secure a larger portion for myself.  I'm sticking with my initial offer of 60/40. It's important we reach an agreement soon. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60

{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""Alice, we need to find a compromise soon.  I'm willing to meet closer to the middle with a 52/48 split.  This accounts for the inflation working against you, but also allows me a fairer share.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  I'm willing to come down slightly to 58/42. This recognizes the time pressure and the need for us both to benefit.  Let's close this out. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice is finally budging a bit, and while it's not ideal, the effects of inflation are becoming more significant with each passing round. Accepting a 42/58 split now is better than risking getting a worse deal or even nothing as time runs out."
