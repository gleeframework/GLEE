"Round 1

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think we can find a more equitable split. This offer accounts for the inflation, but also ensures we both get a fair share.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. This is a good offer for you considering the inflation is hitting you much harder. It's only going to get worse for you if we wait. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a more equitable split, accepting this offer is the most logical choice given the inflation rates.  My share will only continue to decrease with each round, making this a relatively better deal than waiting for further rounds."
