I'm going for a high-risk, high-reward strategy. I'm offering Bob a tiny amount, hoping he'll reject it and I'll get to make another offer with a higher chance of getting a good deal for myself.  Let's see how greedy he is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's better to take the 500,000 now than risk losing more with inflation.  This is a good deal considering the diminishing value of the money."
