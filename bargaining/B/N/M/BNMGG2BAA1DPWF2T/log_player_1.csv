I'm going for a slightly unfair but reasonable split. I want to secure the majority of the money, but I'm also willing to give Bob a small amount to avoid immediate rejection.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While I'm tempted by the larger amount, I'm still confident in my position. It's only the second round, and the inflation isn't significantly impacting my share yet.  I can afford to be patient and see if I can get a better deal.  I'll make my own offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly, demonstrating flexibility but still aiming for a good share. Bob is likely feeling the pressure of inflation, and I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing.  Let's see how he reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 65 
# Bob gain: 35 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to what I would consider fair, but I'm still not satisfied. The inflation is starting to hit him hard, and I believe I can still negotiate a better deal. I'll make my own offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm going to stay firm on my desired share. Bob is clearly feeling the pressure of inflation now, and I think he'll be more likely to accept this offer.  The risk of getting nothing at all is becoming more real for him with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

The inflation is really starting to affect Bob's share, and this offer is getting close to what I was aiming for. While I could continue to negotiate, there's a real risk of both of us getting nothing at this point. I'm going to accept and secure my gain."
