"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being generous, but I'm also a little greedy. This is a fair deal, but I'm willing to negotiate. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is a very lopsided offer. While the game warns of inflation, rejecting this offer allows me to make a counter-proposal in the next round, and even with inflation, a more even split will likely be better for me in the long run."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle. I think this is a fair and equitable way to divide the money.""
