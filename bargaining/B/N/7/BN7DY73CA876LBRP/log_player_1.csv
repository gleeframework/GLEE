"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

This way, I'll get 60% of the original $10,000, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced values due to inflation, I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money is worth less now, I'd like to get a slightly larger share to compensate for the decrease in value. I'll reject Bob's offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In round 3, the money is worth 20% less than in round 2. My proposal is:

This way, I'll get a slightly larger share to account for the continued inflation."

# Bob gain: 3850 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value! Given the decreased value, I'll think about Bob's offer. However, I'm still not convinced that I'm getting a fair share. I'll reject his offer.
