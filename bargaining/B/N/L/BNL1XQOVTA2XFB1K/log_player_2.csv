# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm still not happy with the offer. I'm going to keep pushing for a more even split."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my previous offers were quite generous. I'm going back to my initial offer. It's a good deal for you, given the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I'm not happy with the offer, I've been rejected quite a few times and the inflation is eating into my potential gains.  It's best to take what I can get at this point."
