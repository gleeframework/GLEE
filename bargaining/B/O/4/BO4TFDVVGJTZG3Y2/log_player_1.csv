"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, I'll take the bigger share, but it's a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000, leaving Bob with 20%. I'm framing it as a fair start, but I'm really hoping Bob will accept this generous offer and we can wrap up the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You took a big share last round, now it's my turn to make a fair offer! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to balance the scales after my initial offer.

After considering Bob's proposal, I decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept Bob's offer just yet. I'd like to see if I can negotiate for an even better deal. The money is still worth $9,000 (after the 10% inflation hit), and I'm not convinced that 40% is the best I can get."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's split it 55:45!""
}
```

I'm aiming to take a slightly smaller share this time, but still trying to negotiate a decent deal. The money is now worth $8,100 (after another 10% inflation hit)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted to meet in the middle, but I think I can do better than that! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to one-up me again.

After considering Bob's proposal, I decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, especially since the money is now worth $7,350 (after another 10% inflation hit). I think I can do better than 45% of the remaining amount. I'll keep negotiating!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to take a slightly smaller share, but still trying to get a decent chunk of the remaining money. The money is now worth $6,615 (after another 10% inflation hit)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we're getting closer, but I'm still not willing to give you the upper hand 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is still trying to maintain the upper hand.

After considering Bob's proposal, I decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, especially since the money is now worth $6,048 (after another 10% inflation hit). I think I can get a better deal than 48% of the remaining amount. I'll keep pushing for a better offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's call it a draw, 50/50 split, and be done with it!""
}
```

I'm going for a 50/50 split this time, trying to find a compromise that works for both of us. The money is now worth $5,454.60 (after another 10% inflation hit)."
