400000.0,600000.0,"I think a 60/40 split is fairer, given that we're both taking a risk.  Let's work together to reach a mutually beneficial outcome.",Bob,2,
,,I'm not comfortable with a 60/40 split. How about we meet in the middle at 55/45?,Alice,2,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Considering the reduced value of the money, I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal. This 55.5/44.5 split should be more appealing to you.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"With the inflation factor, a 50/50 split seems the most equitable at this point. Let's end the negotiation and divide the money fairly.",Bob,4,
,,"Alright, let's call it a day. A 50/50 split seems fair, considering the circumstances.",Alice,4,accept
