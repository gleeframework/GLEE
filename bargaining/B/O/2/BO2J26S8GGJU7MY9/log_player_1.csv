"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take $700,000 and you'll get $300,000. What do you say?""
}
```

This offer gives me a significant amount, but leaves Bob with a decent amount as well. Let's see what he has to say!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, given that we're both taking a risk.  Let's work together to reach a mutually beneficial outcome. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is already taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a bit too skewed in his favor. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with a 60/40 split. How about we meet in the middle at 55/45?""
}
```

I'm trying to push for a slightly more favorable split, but still willing to compromise. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation has reduced the value of the money again!

Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the reduced value of the money, I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal. This 55.5/44.5 split should be more appealing to you.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent amount for myself and giving Bob a reasonable share. Let's see if he accepts this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: With the inflation factor, a 50/50 split seems the most equitable at this point. Let's end the negotiation and divide the money fairly. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a bite out of my potential earnings!

Considering Bob's offer, I think a 50/50 split is a reasonable compromise, especially given the reduced value of the money. I'm willing to accept this offer and end the negotiation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, let's call it a day. A 50/50 split seems fair, considering the circumstances.""
}
```"
