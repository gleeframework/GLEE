"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we split the funds with a 3:1 ratio in favor of efficiency and productivity. This could potentially benefit both of us in the long run. 
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's important to consider the inflation factor. Even if the offer seems good now, the value of the money will decrease in subsequent rounds. It's worth seeing if Alice's offer changes as the game progresses."
