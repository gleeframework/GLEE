Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that initial offer was quite low. Let's be fair, I'm proposing a 65/35 split in my favor.  It's a good deal considering the inflation working against both of us. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
