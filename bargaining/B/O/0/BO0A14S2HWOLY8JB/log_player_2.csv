Round 2

{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Alice, that initial offer was quite low. Let's be fair, I'm proposing a 65/35 split in my favor.  It's a good deal considering the inflation working against both of us.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's split the difference. I'll take 550,000 and you get 450,000. This is a fair compromise given the inflation. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
