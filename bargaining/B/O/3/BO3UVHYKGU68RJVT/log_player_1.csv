"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can discuss further if you don't like it.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $10,000 and leaving 40% for Bob."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my gain accordingly.
