"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, it's fair!""}

I'm proposing that we divide the $10,000 equally, with each of us getting $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60/40 is a more fair split, considering I'll be taking on more risk in the future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Since Bob is proposing a 60/40 split, I'll try to negotiate a bit.

{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""I'm not sure 60/40 is fair. Can you consider 55/45 or 52.5/47.5 instead?""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll adjust my proposal accordingly. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4800, ""bob_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think 52/48 is a fairer split considering the reduced value of the money.""}

I'm proposing a 52/48 split, with me getting $4,800 and Bob getting $5,200."
