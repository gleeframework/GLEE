"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can finish the game early.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is a relatively small amount, but it's a fair starting point. I'm keeping the majority of the money, but it's still a significant amount for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth less now, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the loss in value. However, Bob's offer is still quite generous, and I don't want to risk losing out on a good deal.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
