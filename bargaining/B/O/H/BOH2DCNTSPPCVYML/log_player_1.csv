# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50

While tempting, I think Bob's fear of inflation will make him crack.  I can push for a slightly better deal."

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous. I'm taking a small hit to get this done.  Don't be greedy! 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Bob is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation and is willing to accept a less favorable deal. It's still in my best interest to take the offer now rather than risk him offering even less in future rounds."
