"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I want to maximize my share in the first round, as the money is worth the most now.
* I'm offering Bob a small amount, hoping he'll accept it, but if not, I know I can offer him less in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Although the offer is significantly better than my previous one, I'm still losing 800,000 (or 80% of the original 1 million).
* I'm confident that I can get a better deal in the next round. If I reject, I'll be making the offer, and I can keep more for myself.
* Even with the inflation, the 20% loss in each round isn't drastic enough to justify accepting this offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

*  I'm reducing my offer by another 100,000, but still keeping the majority share. 
* The inflation means I need to secure a deal before the value of the money drops further. 
* This is a risky move, but I'm betting that Bob will realize that rejecting this offer could lead to a situation where he gets nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* The inflation has hit hard, reducing the value of my share significantly.  
* If I reject this offer, the next round will see another drop in value, potentially leaving me with very little. 
* While I'm losing a large portion of the initial amount, accepting this offer ensures I still get something.  It's better to accept a smaller share now than risk losing everything."
