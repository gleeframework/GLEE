"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

 I'm going to offer Bob a very small amount, just $1. I want to maximize my own share, and I believe Bob will be tempted to accept even a small amount rather than risk getting nothing if he rejects the offer and we go to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is fair and gives me half of the money. It's in my best interest to accept, rather than risk getting nothing in the next round."
