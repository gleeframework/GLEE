"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

This offer gives me a larger share, but also leaves some room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will accept it, but I'm prepared to make a slightly more generous offer if he rejects it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation means my gain is worth less in each round. Accepting this offer ensures a fair split and avoids further potential loss due to inflation."
