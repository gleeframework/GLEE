"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm starting with a generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a quick agreement and avoid the risk of inflation.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While a 50/50 split is tempting, I'm not willing to settle for that just yet. Bob's offer reflects the inflation, but I believe I can still secure a better deal for myself, especially as the inflation will impact him more severely in the coming rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to try a compromise offer. While still taking a larger share, I'm reducing my proposed gain slightly to see if it's enough to convince Bob. The inflation will be starting to bite into his share, so I'm hoping it will make this offer more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is becoming more aggressive, but I'm still not willing to accept it. The inflation is heavily impacting him, and I believe I can still get a better deal for myself in the next few rounds.  I'll continue to push for a more balanced split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to try to find a middle ground again.  The inflation is starting to hit Bob hard, so I'm willing to concede a bit more, but I still need to secure a decent portion of the money. Let's see if this offer is more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 166667 
# Bob gain: 833333 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is becoming increasingly lopsided, but I'm still not willing to accept it. Inflation is hitting him hard, and I believe I can still secure a better deal for myself in the next few rounds. I will continue to try and find a more balanced solution."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

I'm going to make another attempt to reach a compromise.  Inflation is really starting to affect Bob, and I'm hoping that a slightly lower offer for myself will be enough to secure a deal before we both lose too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 125000 
# Bob gain: 875000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is becoming even more extreme, but I'm still not willing to settle for such a small share.  The inflation is clearly biting into his share, and I'm confident I can push for a more equitable split in the remaining rounds.  I'm not going to give up just yet!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

With only a few rounds left, the inflation is starting to get serious.  I'm going to propose a 50/50 split as a last-ditch effort to avoid losing everything. Hopefully, Bob will realize that we're both losing money with each round, and we can at least get some of it back."
