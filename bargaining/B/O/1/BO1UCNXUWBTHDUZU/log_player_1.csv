"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate, let's just agree and get it over with!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and straightforward offer. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a decent share, but I think I deserve a bit more. Let's see if you can do better. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is already affecting me, and it's getting tougher!

Considering Bob's offer, I think I can do better than 400,000. I'll try to negotiate a bit more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Your offer is a bit too skewed towards you, Bob. I'll need a better deal to consider accepting.""
}
```

It's my turn to make a new proposal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Time to make a new proposal!

Considering the inflation and the fact that Bob's offer was 60/40, I'll aim for a more balanced split. I'll offer a bit more than 40% to Bob, but not too much.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, Bob, but I'm not going to give up my fair share. This is my best offer so far.""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not impressed with your offer, Alice. I think I deserve more, especially considering the value of the money has decreased. I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but don't expect me to give up too much. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering Bob's new offer, I'm not thrilled with the 30/70 split. I think I can do better than 300,000, especially since the money is worth less than it was initially.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Your offer is still too skewed towards you, Bob. I need a better deal to consider accepting. I'm starting to think you're not taking the inflation into account.""

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Time to make a new proposal!

Considering the inflation and Bob's previous offers, I'll aim for a more aggressive split. I'll offer a smaller share to Bob, but I'll also try to make it more attractive by framing it as a ""generous"" offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 490000,
  ""bob_gain"": 510000,
  ""message"": ""I'm being generous, Bob! I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but don't think this is the end of the negotiations. I'm still looking for a fair deal.""

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not impressed with your offer, Alice. I think I deserve more, considering the value of the money has decreased even further. I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give up my share easily. 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is really eating away at my potential earnings!

Considering Bob's new offer, I'm not happy with the 25/75 split. I think I can do better than 250,000, especially since the money is worth significantly less than it was initially.
