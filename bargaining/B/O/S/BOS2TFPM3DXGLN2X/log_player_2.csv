Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want a fair deal. How about we switch the amounts from your last offer? That seems fair, and we both lose less to inflation if we agree now. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500
