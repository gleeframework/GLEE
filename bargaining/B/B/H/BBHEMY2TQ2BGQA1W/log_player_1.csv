Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Okay Alice, let's try this again. How about a 55/45 split in my favor?  It's still a good deal for you before inflation eats away at your share. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55
