Considering Bob's offer, I'll think for a moment...

I'll reject the offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

  ""message"": ""Last chance for a decent deal, take it or leave it!""

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really crippling the value of the money now!

With the extremely reduced value of the money, I'll have to be extremely aggressive in my proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Fine, we'll split it 50-50, but I'm not getting any less than this""
