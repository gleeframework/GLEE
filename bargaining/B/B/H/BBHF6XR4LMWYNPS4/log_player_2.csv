"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly considering future losses 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer sounds fair on the surface, the inflation heavily favors me (Bob). A 5% loss for me is much more manageable than a 20% loss for Alice with each round. By rejecting, I put pressure on Alice to offer a larger share in the next round to avoid further devaluation of her potential earnings."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I understand the future losses are significant for you. This offer compensates me for the risk of further negotiation.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Exploiting Inflation:**  Alice's share loses value much faster than mine. Delaying works in my favor.
* **Strong Opening:** I'm aiming high initially, leaving room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Justification:** The message acknowledges Alice's concerns while highlighting my own position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet in the middle, we both lose if we delay 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:** While I had the upper hand due to the inflation difference, the longer this drags on, the more everyone loses. A 50/50 split now is better than risking a worse offer from a more desperate Alice later. 
* **Fair Outcome:** Alice is right, meeting in the middle is a fair solution at this point. It avoids the risk of both of us losing out significantly as the money continues to devalue."
