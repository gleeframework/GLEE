"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This is a relatively fair split, giving me a slight advantage, but I'm willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my potential gain is now worth even less. Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, which is a more even split than my initial offer. I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
