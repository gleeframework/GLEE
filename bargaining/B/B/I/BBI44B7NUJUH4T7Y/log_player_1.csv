"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my offer for Round 1:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```
This is a 50/50 split, which seems fair to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 20% less for Bob, his offer is quite generous. I'll accept his offer for Round 2:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
