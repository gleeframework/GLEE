"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. We can always negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000. My message to Bob is that I'm starting with a fair split and we can always negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering the potential for inflation.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less after the first round, I'll adjust my gain accordingly.

I'll accept Bob's offer, as it's a 60-40 split, which is similar to my original proposal. I'll take $400,000 and Bob will take $600,000.
