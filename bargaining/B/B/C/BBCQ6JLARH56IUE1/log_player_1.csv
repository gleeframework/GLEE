Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60-40 split in my favor.  While I appreciate your offer, I believe a more equitable split reflects the diminishing value of the money for you in the next rounds. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
