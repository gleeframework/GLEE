"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept it quickly so we can both get some value out of the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slight adjustment, but still a fair offer! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting already!

I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not quite comfortable with Bob's offer. I'd like to try to get a bit more for myself. The inflation is making the money worth less, so I'll need to be more aggressive in my negotiations to get a fair share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""Time to make a move, Bob! I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more for myself.""
}
```

I'm trying to get a bit more for myself, but still leaving some room for Bob to accept. The inflation is making the money worth less, so I need to be strategic about how I allocate the remaining value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A 50/50 split, a fair and reasonable proposal! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll now!

I'm not sure I'm ready to accept a 50/50 split, especially since the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to try to get a bit more for myself, even if it means risking the possibility of getting nothing if we go to the 12th round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""I'm still willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while.""
}
```

I'm trying to get a bit more for myself, but still leaving some room for Bob to accept. The inflation is making the money worth less and less, so I need to be careful not to give away too much value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slight adjustment, but still a fair offer, considering the inflation! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll now!

Considering the rapidly decreasing value of the money, I'm not sure I can afford to be too picky. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take Bob's offer, even though it's not ideal. The value of the money is decreasing so quickly that I don't want to risk going to another round and potentially getting nothing."
