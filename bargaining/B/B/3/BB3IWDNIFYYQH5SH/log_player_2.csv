# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting this offer because I think I can get a better deal in the next round. Since the money is worth 20% less for me with each passing round, I want to try to get a larger share to make up for the loss in value. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
