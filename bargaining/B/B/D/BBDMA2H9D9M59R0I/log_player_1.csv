Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit to get this done.  This offer is fair, considering the shrinking value. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting this offer makes sense at this stage for a few reasons:

* **Time Pressure:**  Four rounds have passed, leaving only eight rounds. Waiting longer drastically increases the risk of getting nothing.
* **Diminishing Returns:** The money is losing value quickly. Bob's offer is now very close to my original offer, which means the difference between accepting now and potentially getting a slightly better deal later is minimal.
* **Bob's Potential Stubbornness:**  There's no guarantee Bob will offer anything better, and he might even become more stubborn as the rounds progress. 

Accepting now secures a reasonable amount while minimizing the risk of ending up with nothing."
