"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, you can have the scraps! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's trying to take advantage of the situation, isn't he?

I'll think carefully about this offer...

After considering the proposal, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think it's fair that I'd get only 40% of the original 100$, while Bob gets 60%. I'll hold out for a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer in Round 2 was 60-40, I'll try to counter with a proposal that's more favorable to me. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher share.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 45% of the original 100$, which is a bit more than his previous offer. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting low, Alice! I'll take most of the cash! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob's trying to squeeze me dry!

Considering the inflation, I'll calculate the actual value of the offer:

* Alice gain: 30 * 0.7289 (100% - 27.1% inflation) = 21.87
* Bob gain: 70 * 0.7289 = 51.03

I'll think carefully about this offer...

After considering the proposal, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think it's fair that I'd get only 21.87% of the original 100$, while Bob gets 51.03%. I'll try to negotiate for a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive proposal to counter Bob's previous offer. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a higher share.

Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""You're pushing your luck, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the original 100$, which is a bit more favorable to me than his previous offer. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
