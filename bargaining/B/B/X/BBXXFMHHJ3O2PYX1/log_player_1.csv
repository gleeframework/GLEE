"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point.""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, this is a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm considering Bob's offer.

Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll adjust the values accordingly.

My new gain would be 50% of the initial $100, which is $50, minus 5% of $50, which is $2.5. So, my effective gain would be $47.5.

Bob's gain would be $50, minus 20% of $50, which is $10. So, his effective gain would be $40.

After considering the adjusted values, I think this offer is reasonable. I'll accept Bob's offer.
