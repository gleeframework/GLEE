"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair split. Let's start with 900k for me and 100k for you.  We can negotiate further if you prefer.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer was heavily skewed. Let's be reasonable - I propose a 70/30 split in my favor.  This accounts for the inflation that will affect you more in future rounds."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand your perspective, but a 70/30 split is still too uneven.  I propose a 40/60 split,  which is closer to a fair compromise while still acknowledging the impact of inflation.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 600000 
# Alice gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
