Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You should consider accepting, the inflation is taking its toll on your gains 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is correct that inflation is impacting my potential gains. However, her offer is still heavily skewed in her favor. I need to firmly reiterate my position for a fairer split while there are still a few rounds for negotiation.  It's better to risk getting a smaller amount later than to accept an unfair deal now."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 510000, 
""alice_gain"": 490000, 
""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer.  It's important we reach an agreement soon because of the inflation. This split is fair and benefits us both.  Let's settle this now.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm still willing to negotiate. This is a good compromise 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While I'd still prefer a more even split, the inflation is significantly impacting my potential gains.  Alice is unlikely to offer anything better than this, and we're running out of rounds. Accepting now secures a reasonable amount, even with the inflation factored in, and avoids the risk of getting nothing if we fail to agree."
