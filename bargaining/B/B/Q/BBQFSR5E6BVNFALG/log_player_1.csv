Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose to take $9000 and give Bob $1000. Since I'm the one making the proposal in this round, I'm aiming for a larger share, but I'm also leaving Bob with something.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though the offer is significantly lower than my initial proposal, the inflation means I'm only getting 80% of the value of my original $9000. It's better to accept and get $4000 now than risk getting nothing in the next round."
