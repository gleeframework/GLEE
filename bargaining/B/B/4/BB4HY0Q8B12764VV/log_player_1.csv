``` 

I'm going to propose a 900k/100k split in my favor.  It's a pretty big chunk of the money, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it knowing that if he rejects, he'll be risking the possibility of getting even less in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob's offer is a bit insulting, especially after my generous first offer! I'm not going to accept a 100k/900k split, especially since the money is worth less now.  I'll counter with my own proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer slightly to 850k for me and 150k for Bob.  While I'm still hoping for a good chunk of the money, I'm also factoring in the decreasing value of the money with each round. This should be a fair offer for both of us, especially considering how much less my 850k is worth compared to the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly ridiculous.  I'm not going to accept a 200k/800k split, especially since the money is worth significantly less now. I'll keep playing and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

I'm going to make one last attempt to get a decent deal. I'm lowering my offer to 750k for me and 250k for Bob.  It's a significant decrease from my previous offers, but I'm hoping Bob realizes that the money is losing value rapidly and that this might be the best deal he'll get."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, especially considering how much less the money is worth for me now. I'm not going to accept it. I'll make my own offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}
```

I'm going to take a big risk and offer a 650k/350k split.  I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm also hoping that Bob is starting to realize that we're running out of time.  The money is worth a lot less now than it was at the beginning, and if we don't reach an agreement soon, we'll both end up with nothing."
