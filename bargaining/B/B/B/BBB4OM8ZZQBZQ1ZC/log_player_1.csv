"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can adjust in future rounds.""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more balanced split is fairer. Let's see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the value of the money has decreased. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I want to give you the majority share, especially with the inflation affecting my end.""
}
```

I'm not convinced that a 60-40 split is fair, especially since the value of the money is decreasing. I'll try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to keep a slight edge due to the uncertainty of inflation.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to a 55-45 split, trying to maintain a slight advantage while still being willing to compromise."
