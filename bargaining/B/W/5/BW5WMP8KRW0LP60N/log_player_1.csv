Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was a bit too lopsided.  Let's be realistic. I'm proposing a 45/55 split. This reflects the time pressure but is still fair. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
