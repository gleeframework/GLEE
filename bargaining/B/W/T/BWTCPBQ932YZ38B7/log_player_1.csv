"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take 60%""}\n\nI'll take 60% of the money, which is $6000, and Bob will get 40%, which is $4000. I've attached a message saying ""Let's be fair, I'll take 60%"" to try to persuade Bob to accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn! How about a slightly better split for me this time? 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 10% less for me in this round, I would actually only get $4050 (90% of $4500), while Bob would get the full $5500. I think I can get a better deal, so I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""I'll take a bit less than before, but still more than you offered me""}\n\nI'll offer to take $5800, which is 58% of the money, and Bob will get $4200, which is 42%. I've attached a message saying ""I'll take a bit less than before, but still more than you offered me"" to try to negotiate with Bob. Since the money is worth 10% less for me in this round, I'm actually offering to take $5220 in value (90% of $5800), but I won't mention that to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This seems like a fair deal considering the inflation. Let's settle this now. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","I accept Bob's offer. Although the money is worth 27.1% less for me in this round, I think this offer is reasonable considering the decreasing value of the money for me. I would actually get $3500 in value (72.9% of $4800), which is still a significant amount. Since Bob seems willing to settle, I'll accept this offer to avoid further losses due to inflation.### {""decision"": ""accept""}"
