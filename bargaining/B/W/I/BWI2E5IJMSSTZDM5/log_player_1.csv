Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm proposing to take 9000 dollars and leave Bob with 1000 dollars. This way, I secure a good amount, and he still gets something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though I'm getting less than in the first round, it's still better to accept now. I'm only losing 10% of the value, while Bob is losing 20%. If I reject, I might end up with nothing in the next round."
