"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 40% and keep 60% for myself.""}

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $100, which is $40, and keeping 60% for myself, which is $60."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 55/45 is a fairer split, considering the inflation factor. Let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm considering Bob's offer...

After calculating the value of the proposed split, I realize that if I accept this offer, I'll get $45, which is worth 4.375% less than the initial $60 I was hoping for.

I'm not thrilled about the reduced value, but I don't want to risk going to the next round and potentially losing even more value due to further inflation.

So, I'll decide to...
