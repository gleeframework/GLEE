Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm meeting you halfway this time. Let's close this deal before inflation eats away any more of our potential winnings! 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Even though Alice is meeting me halfway, the inflation is drastically cutting into my potential gains. It's getting riskier to keep rejecting, but I need to hold out for a slightly better deal in the next few rounds while it's still worthwhile."
