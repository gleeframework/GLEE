"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm offering a 50-50 split, hoping to get a fair deal right off the bat."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less now, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. I'd rather not give up as much as 55, but I don't want to risk going to the next round and losing even more value due to inflation.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
