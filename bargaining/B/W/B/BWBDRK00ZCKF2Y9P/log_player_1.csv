"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this and we can split the $10,000 now!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is a relatively generous offer considering the inflation factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Accept this and you'll be leaving $3000 on the table! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of $3,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, and Bob's gain of $7,000 is now worth 80% of its original value.

Considering Bob's aggressive offer, I'll reject it. My goal is to maximize my gain, and I think I can do better.
