"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you 40%""
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking a little more, but I'm still being fair.  Let's end this before things get worse. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully.

Since Bob's offer is still slightly biased towards him, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In the third round, the money is worth even less due to inflation. I'll have to be more aggressive in my proposal.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation""
}
```

This way, I'll get 52% of the remaining value of the money, and Bob will get 48%."
