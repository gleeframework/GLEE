"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a small portion, but I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal later.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. I'm hoping this will be a starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to adjusting the split in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your generosity in the first round, but I believe a more equitable split is in order.  Let's aim for a 90/10 split in my favor this time. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering the new offer, I'll have to accept the 5% reduction in value of my gain. With the 5% inflation, my gain would be 855,000 (100,000 * 0.95).

However, I don't think a 90/10 split is equitable, especially considering the initial proposal I made was already generous. I'll have to reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain is now worth 5% less than in the previous round. So, my gain is now 855,000 * 0.95 = 813,250.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think this is a fairer split considering the inflation. Let's see if you agree.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself."
