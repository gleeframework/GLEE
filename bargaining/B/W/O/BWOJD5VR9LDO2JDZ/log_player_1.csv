I'm going for a pretty aggressive first offer, hoping to secure a large portion of the money early on.  I'll be keeping a close eye on the inflation, though!"

# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my previous proposal, and I'm not willing to settle for such a small share. I'll reject this offer and see what he offers next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

We're getting close to the end of the game, and the value of the money is dropping rapidly. I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is the fairest way to divide the remaining money.  Hopefully, Bob will finally see the value in reaching an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is simply too low. The money is worth a fraction of what it was initially, but I am still not willing to accept such a small share.  I will reject this offer and see what he offers next round."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to account for the increasing inflation.  We are running out of rounds, and I'm willing to give up more to secure a deal.  I'm hoping Bob will see the urgency of reaching an agreement before we lose even more money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 300000, ""bob_gain"": 700000}
```

With only two rounds left, the pressure is on. I'm making a final concession to reach an agreement, offering a 30/70 split.  I'm hoping Bob realizes that it's better to take what's on the table than risk losing everything."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a ridiculous offer.  Even though we're at the very end of the game and the value of the money is extremely low, I'm not going to accept a share that's so small. Bob is being greedy, and I'd rather see us both get nothing than accept such an unfair deal."
