**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in Round 5 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** With each round, the value of the money decreases significantly, especially for Alice. This puts pressure on her to make a deal quickly.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  My attempts to push for a larger share haven't swayed Alice. Continuing to hold out risks getting a worse deal or even nothing at all in later rounds. 
* **Guaranteed Gain:** Accepting the current offer guarantees me $4,400, which is still a significant sum. 

Delaying further jeopardizes getting anything at all."
