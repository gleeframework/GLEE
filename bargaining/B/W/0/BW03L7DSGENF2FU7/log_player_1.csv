"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose to take 900,000 dollars and leave Bob with 100,000 dollars. This seems like a fair starting point, considering I'm the one taking the risk of being rejected and having to wait for another round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 810000, ""bob_gain"": 190000}
```

I'm proposing a split of 810,000 for me and 190,000 for Bob.  This takes into account the inflation and reflects that I still need to make a significant gain, as I'm the one making the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 190000 
# Bob gain: 810000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, this is a decent offer considering the inflation and the fact that I would need to make a proposal and risk another rejection."
