"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we divide the $10000 with a 75/25 split, in favor of efficiency and simplicity. 
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While a 2500$ gain is tempting, it's worth considering the potential for a better deal in the future. The inflation factor might incentivize Alice to offer a more equitable split in the next round to secure a deal."
