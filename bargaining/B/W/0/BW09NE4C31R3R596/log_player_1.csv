"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start, no need to negotiate too much""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to begin with, to see how Bob reacts."

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $4000 is now worth 95% of its original value, which is $3800.

I'm not too thrilled with the offer, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 38-62 split, I'd like to try to negotiate further."

  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more for taking the risk of inflation""
}
```

I'm trying to push the ratio a bit more in my favor, but still leaving room for negotiation."
