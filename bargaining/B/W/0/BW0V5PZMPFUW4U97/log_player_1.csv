"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI'll offer Bob $4000, which is 40% of the total amount, and I'll take $6000, which is 60% of the total amount. I'm hoping that Bob will accept this offer since it's still a decent amount for him. I've also included a message saying ""Let's split fairly"" to try to persuade Bob that this is a reasonable offer.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know if Bob accepts or rejects my offer. If he rejects it, I'll have to come up with a new proposal for the next round. Keep in mind that the money is worth 20% less for me in each subsequent round, so I'll have to take that into account when making my next offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. This offer is fairer considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Although the money is worth 20% less for me in this round, I still think I can get a better deal. Bob's offer of $4500 for me is less than what I offered him in the first round, and I'm not convinced that it's a fair split considering the inflation. I'll make a new proposal in the next round and try to negotiate a better deal.\n\n###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nIn this round, I'll take into account the fact that the money is worth 40% less for me than in the first round (20% less in the second round, and another 20% less in this round). I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to Bob, while still being reasonable. I'll offer Bob $5000, which is 50% of the total amount, and I'll take $5000, which is also 50% of the total amount. I'll include a message saying ""Meet me in the middle"" to try to persuade Bob that this is a fair offer.\n\n###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know if Bob accepts or rejects my offer. If he rejects it, I'll have to come up with a new proposal for the next round. Keep in mind that the money is worth even less for me in each subsequent round, so I'll have to take that into account when making my next offer."
