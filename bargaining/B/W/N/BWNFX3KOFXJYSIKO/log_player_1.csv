"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. This is a reasonable starting point, and I think it's a fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55-45 split is fairer, considering we both lose value with each round. Let's work towards a compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 55-45 split, but I understand Bob's point about the value decreasing with each round. I'll consider it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'd like to make a counteroffer to try to get a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, let's split it 50-50 and end this!""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a fair compromise considering the decreasing value of the money. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finally divide the money."
