Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. I understand you want a larger share, but I'm proposing a 65/35 split in my favor.  Consider the rapid devaluation -  it hurts you far more than me. This ensures we both walk away with something substantial. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, time is running out, and we're both losing money! My last offer was more than generous. This is a 55/45 split in my favor. You need to consider the decreasing value of the money - another refusal only hurts us both. Let's be logical and end this.
