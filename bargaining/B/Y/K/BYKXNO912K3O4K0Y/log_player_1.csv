"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and end the game quickly!""
}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and straightforward offer. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."

Round 2

# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly less generous offer, but still a good one! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is a bit more skewed towards him, but it's still a decent offer. Considering the inflation, the effective difference between the two amounts is even more significant.

I'll decide to reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while.""
