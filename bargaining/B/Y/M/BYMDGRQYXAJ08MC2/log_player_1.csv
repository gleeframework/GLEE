"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly.""}\n\n###\n\nI'll offer Bob $4,000 and keep $6,000 for myself. I believe this is a reasonable division, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it. The message ""Let's divide fairly"" is meant to convey a sense of cooperation and mutual benefit. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm aiming for a slightly better split this time.  Think it over carefully, the value decreases quickly! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money I gain is worth 20% less in this round, the $4,500 offered by Bob is equivalent to $3,600 in the first round. Meanwhile, the money Bob gains is only worth 10% less, so the $5,500 he's offering himself is equivalent to $4,950 in the first round. Considering the decreasing value of the money, I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal in the next round.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nIn this round, I'll take into account the decreasing value of the money due to inflation. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less in each round, I'll try to get a larger share to compensate for the loss. I'll offer Bob $4,200, which is equivalent to $3,360 in the first round, considering the 20% decrease in value for me and the 10% decrease for Bob. I'll keep $5,800 for myself, which is equivalent to $4,640 in the first round.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's adjust the split.""}\n\n###\n\nLet's see how Bob responds to this offer!"
