"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and close the deal!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. This way, we both get a fair share and don't risk losing it all to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nIt's still early in the game, and accepting an even split would mean I'm losing out on potential gains. I'll take the risk of inflation to try and negotiate a better deal. Plus, since the money is worth 10% less for me in each round, I want to try and get a larger share to compensate for the loss in value."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a larger share to compensate for inflation, but still giving you a good deal. Let's close this before the money devalues further!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger share than your last offer. This split is fair considering the inflation, and we can both walk away with a significant amount. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nAlthough Bob's offer seems reasonable, I need to consider the impact of inflation on my share. Since the money is worth 27.1% less for me now, accepting this offer would mean I'm getting significantly less value than I would have in the initial rounds. I'll continue to negotiate, hoping to get a larger share to offset the loss in value due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""Inflation is taking a toll, and I need a larger share to make up for it. This is my most generous offer considering the circumstances. Let's end this before it's too late!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a larger share to account for inflation, but I need a bigger cut than your last offer. We're running out of time, and this deal is the best we can get at this point. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on my share, I think accepting this offer is the best decision. The money is now worth 40.95% less for me, and further negotiations might not yield a better deal. Bob's offer seems reasonable, given the circumstances, and I'd rather secure this amount than risk getting nothing if we fail to reach an agreement within the remaining rounds."
