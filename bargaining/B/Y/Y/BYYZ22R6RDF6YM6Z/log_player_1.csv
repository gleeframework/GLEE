"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the money, which is $600,000, and leaving Bob with 40%, which is $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal this time! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gain remaining the same value as in the first round, but Bob's money being worth 20% less, I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

  ""message"": ""I'll meet you halfway, let's try to find a compromise!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 55% of the money, which is $550,000, and leaving Bob with 45%, which is $450,000."
