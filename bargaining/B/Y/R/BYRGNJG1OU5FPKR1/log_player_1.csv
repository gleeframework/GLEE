"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the money, leaving 40% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split it evenly, Alice. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is now worth less, so I'll have to be more careful with my decisions.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll reject it. I'd rather try to get more money than split it evenly.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit less this time, Bob. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 55% of the money, leaving 45% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we should aim for a slight imbalance in favor of fairness, Alice. How about this? 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on my potential gains. Considering Bob's new offer, I'll accept it. I'd rather have 45% of the money now, with the inflation factored in, than risk getting less in future rounds.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
