  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept this and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split in my favor, with me getting $8,000 and Bob getting $2,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer to avoid further negotiations."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly lower amount, but it's still a good deal. Don't wait for the money to lose more value! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing rapidly!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'd rather wait for the next round and try to negotiate a better deal. The value of the money will decrease even further, so I'm hoping to get a better split in the next round."

# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing rapidly, and I'm starting to feel the pinch!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm not willing to accept a 45-55 split, even with the lower value of money. I'd rather wait for the next round and try to negotiate a better deal, hoping the value of money will continue to decrease for Bob more than for me."

}
```

# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing rapidly, and I'm starting to feel the pinch even more!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer because, at this point, I'd rather take what I can get and end the game quickly. The value of money is decreasing so rapidly that I'm not confident I can do better in the next round. I'll take the $3,500 and consider it a decent outcome."
