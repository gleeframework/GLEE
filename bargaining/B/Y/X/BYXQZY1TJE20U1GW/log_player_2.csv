"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, I get a bit more 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While it seems like a bad deal for Bob on the surface, the inflation works heavily in his favor. Alice loses value faster than he does. It's better to wait for a more favorable offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, let's compromise. This offer ensures you get a good amount while accounting for the decreasing value.""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Leveraging Inflation:**  Alice is more sensitive to the decreasing value of the money. By Round 2, her $600,000 offer from Round 1 is already less appealing.
* **Appearing Reasonable:** Bob needs to incentivize Alice to accept a deal. Offering a slightly better split than the previous round shows he's willing to negotiate.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:**  This offer isn't overly greedy. It leaves room for Bob to potentially concede a little more in later rounds if needed, while still securing a decent outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle of our previous offers 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is feeling the pressure of the inflation and moving closer to a more even split. This means time is working in Bob's favor. Accepting now would mean missing out on potential gains from her increasingly desperate position in later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 475000,
""alice_gain"": 525000,
""message"": ""Time is running out, and the value is decreasing rapidly. This offer is a fair compromise to ensure we both walk away with something substantial.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increased Pressure:** Both players are feeling the heat of the decreasing value, but Alice more so. Bob needs to capitalize on this urgency.
* **Strategic Concession:**  A bump of $5,000 from his last offer might seem small, but it signals to Alice that Bob is willing to negotiate and that this offer is serious. 
* **Balancing Act:** This offer balances Bob's desire for a larger share with the need to secure a deal before time runs out. The longer the game goes, the less everyone wins."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Counteroffer, slightly higher than last, considering the urgency 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly feeling the pressure now. While her counter offer is slightly better than her previous one, it's still worse than what Bob proposed in Round 4. She's trying to regain control, but Bob holds the advantage with the inflation working in his favor. This indicates that there's a good chance of securing an even better deal in the next round.  Bob needs to hold firm."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Let's be realistic, Alice. The clock is ticking and we both lose with every wasted round. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical solution at this point.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Turning Point:**  Six rounds in, the dynamic has shifted. Alice's counter-offer in Round 5 shows she's feeling the pressure.  
* **Strong Position:** Bob now needs to push his advantage. The 50/50 split is fair, especially considering the significant value lost to inflation by this point. 
* **Urgency:**  The message highlights the dwindling time and emphasizes the mutually beneficial aspect of a quick and clean agreement. Delaying further only hurts both players."
