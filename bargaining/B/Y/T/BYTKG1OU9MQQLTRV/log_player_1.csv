Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial 100$ and Bob gets 40%."

# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this one...

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about the 30% share for Bob, considering I was willing to give him 40% initially. I'm hoping to do better than that. Let's see what I can come up with for Round 3!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still want a slightly bigger share""}

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the initial 100$ and Bob gets 45%."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting desperate, but I'm still not giving up! Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll!

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm not thrilled about the 25% share for Bob, but considering the situation and the fact that the money is worth less and less, I think this is a decent compromise. I'll take it and hope that Bob will be satisfied."
