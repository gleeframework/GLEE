"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, it's a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slightly more balanced split, let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting the money!

I'll consider Bob's new offer. A 55-45 split is a bit more balanced than my initial offer, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer. Since Bob's last offer was 55-45, I'll try to get a bit more. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""message"": ""Meeting you in the middle, let's try 48-52!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 48-52 split, trying to get closer to a more balanced split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's aim for a 50-50 split, it's a fair compromise! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is getting more aggressive with his offers!

A 50-50 split is a fair compromise, but I'm not sure if I want to give up the extra $100,000 I was hoping for. However, I don't want to risk going into the next round with even less money due to inflation. I'll accept Bob's offer.
