"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, we can reevaluate later""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer to start the game."

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share this time, but I'm still willing to negotiate 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth 20% less for Bob, he's effectively taking $5600 (7000 / 0.8) in today's value. I'm taking $3000, which is the same as in the previous round.

I'm not sure if I want to give up too much more, so I'll reject this offer.
