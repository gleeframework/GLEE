"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I propose we split the money 60/40. I'm sure we can reach a deal quickly. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. With inflation, the money is worth less for both of us, but more so for Alice. I'm hoping to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a more reasonable split. Let's close the deal before the money loses more value.""}\n\n###\n\nI'm trying to take advantage of the fact that the money loses more value for Alice, so I'm making a slightly more aggressive offer. I'm still leaving room for negotiation, but I want to put some pressure on Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable. The inflation is hurting both of us. How about a 50/50 split to avoid further losses? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the inflation, a 50/50 split seems like a good deal for me. The money is worth less now, but I'm still getting half of the original amount. Since Alice is losing more value due to inflation, I think she's being reasonable with this offer, and I don't want to risk losing more value in future rounds."
