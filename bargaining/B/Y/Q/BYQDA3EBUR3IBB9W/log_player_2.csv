Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.

# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. This is the best offer you'll get considering the inflation. A 50/50 split makes the most sense. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000
