This offer gives me a larger share of the money, but still leaves Bob with a significant amount. I want to see if he'll accept this relatively fair offer in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is worse than my initial offer, even considering inflation. I'll reject it and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

I'm lowering my share slightly to account for inflation, but I'm still aiming for a majority of the money. I hope Bob realizes that rejecting my offer in the last round wasn't a good move, and he'll accept this one."
