"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can always negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40 and keeping $60 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 51/49 split is more fair, let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","The 5% inflation has already taken a bite out of my potential gain.

I'll consider Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I think I can do better than 49, let's keep negotiating!""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and looking for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more given the inflation.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $45 and keeping $55 for myself, trying to take into account the 5% inflation that has occurred so far."
