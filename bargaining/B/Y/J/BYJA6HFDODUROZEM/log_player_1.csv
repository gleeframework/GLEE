# Bob gain: 5500

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. The inflation is starting to bite, and if we keep rejecting each other, we'll both end up with less.  A 50/50 split is the fairest way to ensure we both get a decent share before the value drops further.
