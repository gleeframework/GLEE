"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the original $10,000, which is $8,000, and leaving $2,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly. It's a win-win for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $5,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, which is $4,500.

I don't think this offer is fair, considering the value of the money I would receive is less than what I initially proposed. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain is worth 81% of its original value now (90% of 90%). I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000, which is worth 81% of the original $7,500, and leaving $4,000 for Bob."
