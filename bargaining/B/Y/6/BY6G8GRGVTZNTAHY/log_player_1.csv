"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

This offer gives me a significant advantage, but it's still reasonable enough that Bob might accept it. I'll be taking advantage of the fact that he doesn't know how the inflation impacts him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly better for him than my first offer was for me, and while the inflation affects me more, I'm still better off rejecting this and making a counter-offer in the next round.  I need to try to get a larger share of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm increasing my share a bit from the previous offer. While I'm aware that the inflation impacts me more than Bob, I'm betting that he might accept this offer, especially if he's expecting a more drastic increase in my share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though I'm getting significantly less than what I initially aimed for, the inflation has impacted me so much that accepting a 50/50 split is the best option at this point.  I'd rather get something than nothing."
