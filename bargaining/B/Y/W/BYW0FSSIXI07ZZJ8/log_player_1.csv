"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}
``` 

I propose that I receive $990,000 and Bob receives $10,000. This ensures a large share for me while still giving Bob a small amount to incentivize acceptance in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would prefer more, accepting this offer guarantees me half of the remaining money. Given the risk of inflation, and the possibility of getting nothing in the following rounds, this seems like the most logical choice."
