"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This offer gives me the majority of the money, but still leaves Bob with a decent amount to keep him interested in negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more careful with the inflation in mind.

I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think I can do better than this."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a higher percentage of the remaining money. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This offer gives me a slightly higher share, but still leaves Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Wait a minute... This offer is the same as my previous offer! I think Bob is trying to trick me. I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll make a new offer that takes into account the increased inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll try to adjust for the increasing inflation. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

This offer gives us a 50/50 split, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can do."
