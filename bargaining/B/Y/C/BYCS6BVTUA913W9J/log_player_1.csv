"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this offer and we can split the money fairly. If you reject, I'll make a better offer next round.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount, but it's a fair starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finalize the division of the money."
