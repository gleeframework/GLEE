Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going for a large share in the first round, hoping Bob will accept it to avoid the risk of inflation.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, I'm taking Bob's offer.  The inflation rate is significant, and I don't want to risk getting a worse deal in the next round."
