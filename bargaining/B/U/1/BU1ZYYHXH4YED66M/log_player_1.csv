"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives Alice 90% of the money and Bob 10%.  It's a relatively generous offer to start, but I'm hoping that Bob will accept it rather than risk the inflation affecting the money he gets in a future round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While I'm losing money due to inflation, I would still rather reject this offer. I believe I can get a better deal in the next round. I'll try to make a more balanced offer, but I'm not willing to be pushed around by Bob's initial proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

I'm offering a 750,000/250,000 split.  This is a more balanced offer than the initial one, and since the money is worth less to me now with inflation, I'm hoping this will be appealing enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Although the inflation is hitting me hard, I still reject this offer.  I'm now losing almost half of my potential earnings due to inflation, but I believe I can still secure a better deal in the next round by making a more equitable offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

With the inflation continuing, I'm now taking a significant hit on my potential earnings.  A 50/50 split is the fairest offer I can make, and I believe it's a better deal than what Bob has been offering.  It's time to end this game and secure a reasonable share of the money."
