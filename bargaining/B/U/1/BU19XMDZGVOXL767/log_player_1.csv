"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This means I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less, the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: 6000 / 0.9 = 6666.67
Bob gain: 4000 / 0.9 = 4444.44

I'll accept Bob's offer.
