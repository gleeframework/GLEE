Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is attempting to compromise, the rapid inflation for her means waiting even a single round significantly reduces her potential gains. I'm betting she'll become more agreeable to my terms in the next round, as time is working against her more significantly than against me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 51, ""alice_gain"": 49, ""message"": ""Alice, this is a final offer. Take it before inflation eats further into your share. I'm taking a small hit here to end this.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's getting close to the wire.  This offer is a slight concession from my previous position, making it appear as a compromise. However, it's designed to be appealing to Alice given the rapid devaluation of her potential gains.  The message emphasizes urgency and the negative impact of further delay, hopefully pushing her to accept."
