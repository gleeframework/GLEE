"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm starting with a 90/10 split in my favor.  It's a pretty aggressive offer, but I want to see if Bob will bite.  I'm hoping he'll be willing to accept something rather than risk getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's an improvement from the previous round, I'm still losing a significant amount due to inflation.  I want to see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm offering a slightly more balanced split this time, hoping to find a middle ground.  I still want a decent portion of the money, but I'm willing to compromise a bit to avoid the risk of getting nothing in the later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is getting risky. Inflation is hitting hard, and I'm losing a lot of money.  Although it's not ideal, accepting Bob's offer is the best way to ensure I get something.  At this rate, I might get nothing if I keep rejecting."
