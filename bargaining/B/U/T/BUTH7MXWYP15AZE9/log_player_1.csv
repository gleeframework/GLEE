"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

This is a generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it quickly so we can avoid the inflation that will reduce the value of the money over time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll have to be careful with the inflation, but I'm not going to give up yet. Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll try to do better in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","The inflation is starting to bite!

Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive this time, but still leaving some room for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll!

I'll have to think carefully about this one... But I'm not going to give up now. Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll try to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","The pressure is mounting!

Here's my new proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm getting desperate, but I think this is a fair split, considering the inflation has already taken a big bite out of my potential earnings."
