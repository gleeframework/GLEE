Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most strategic move. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for Bob.  While my $45 remains constant, his $55 is now worth significantly less than it was in Round 1.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  If I reject this offer, there's no guarantee I can secure a better deal in the next round. Bob might become even more desperate and offer an even smaller amount.
* **Time Value:**  Even though $45 is less than my initial offer, it's better to secure a reasonable amount now than risk getting a worse deal later.

This decision reflects a balance between maximizing potential gain and minimizing potential loss in the face of inflation and a time-sensitive negotiation."
