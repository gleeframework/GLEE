"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a decent amount to start the negotiation.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $10,000, leaving Bob with $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. A 50/50 split is the most logical way to start. We both get a good amount, and there's no need for further rounds. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, the actual amounts I would gain are:

Alice gain: $5,000 x 0.9 = $4,500
Bob gain: $5,000

I don't think a 50/50 split is the most logical way to start, considering the inflation. I'd rather wait for a better offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth 90% of its original value, so I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share this time, but I'm willing to compromise. Let's see if you can do better.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the adjusted $9,000, leaving Bob with $3,600."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share this time, but I believe a 60/40 split is more fair. We both get a decent amount, and it avoids further rounds of negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 27.1% less due to inflation, the actual amounts I would gain are:

Alice gain: $4,000 x 0.727 = $2,908
Bob gain: $6,000

I don't think a 60/40 split is fair, considering the inflation has already reduced the value of the money. I'd rather wait for a better offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth 72.7% of its original value, so I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think I deserve a larger portion considering the inflation. Let's see if you can do better.""

```

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the adjusted $7,270, leaving Bob with $2,910."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is starting to bite, but I'm still willing to offer you a decent amount. Let's try a 70/30 split to avoid further rounds. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 40.95% less due to inflation, the actual amounts I would gain are:

Alice gain: $3,000 x 0.59205 = $1,776.15
Bob gain: $7,000

I think a 70/30 split is not favorable to me, especially considering the significant reduction in value due to inflation. I'd rather wait for a better offer.

# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 52.17% less due to inflation, the actual amounts I would gain are:

Alice gain: $2,000 x 0.4769 = $953.80
Bob gain: $8,000

I think this is a very low offer, especially considering the significant reduction in value due to inflation. I'd rather wait for a better offer.

# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 61.26% less due to inflation, the actual amounts I would gain are:

Alice gain: $1,000 x 0.3847 = $384.70
Bob gain: $9,000

I think this is a very low offer, and I'm not willing to accept it. I'd rather take the risk of waiting for a better offer or going without the money than accepting such a small share.

Round 11
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth 38.47% of its original value, so I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""I'm making a final push for a 50/50 split. Let's end this and split the remaining value evenly.""

```

I'm proposing that we split the adjusted $3,847.00 evenly, with each of us getting $1,923.50.

(Note: This is my last chance to make a proposal, and I'm hoping Bob will accept a 50/50 split to avoid going without any money.)"
