"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob in JSON format:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's be fair and end this quickly!""
}
```

In this offer, I propose that I receive $60 and Bob receives $40. I've also included a brief message encouraging Bob to accept the offer and end the game quickly, as the value of the money decreases with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering I get to make the offer this round. Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob in JSON format:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 58,
  ""bob_gain"": 42,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve the bigger share.""
}
```

Note that due to inflation, the actual value of the money has decreased by 20% compared to the initial round (10% decrease in round 2, and another 10% decrease in round 3). However, for the sake of simplicity, we'll continue to negotiate using the original $100 amount."

# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55
