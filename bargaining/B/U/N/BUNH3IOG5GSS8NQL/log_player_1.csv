"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

This offer is a bit cheeky, but it's a starting point.  It highlights the significant power Alice holds in the first round, given the lack of inflation for her. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}

While it's tempting to keep playing and potentially get even more, it's important to consider the inflation factor.  Bob's offer is a fair split, and accepting it guarantees a significant amount of money for Alice.  It's better to take the sure thing than risk losing out to inflation in subsequent rounds."
