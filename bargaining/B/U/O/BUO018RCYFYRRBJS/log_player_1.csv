Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a fairly generous offer, giving Bob a small share. I want to see how he responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}

While I'd prefer to get more, it's better to take the 500,000 now than risk getting nothing in future rounds."
