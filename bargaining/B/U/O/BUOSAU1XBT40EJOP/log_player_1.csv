"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 7:3, fair and square!""
}
```

This way, I get 70% of the original 100$, which is $70, and Bob gets 30% of the original 100$, which is $30."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we divide it 4:6, considering the decrease in value over time. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the 5% decrease in value, the money I gain is now worth 95% of the original amount. So, if I accept Bob's offer, I would get $60 x 0.95 = $57, and Bob would get $40.

I'll accept the offer.
