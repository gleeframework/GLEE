Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out, and the deal is getting worse for both of us with each round. This is my compromise for a quick and fair agreement.

# Alice gain: 550000

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be reasonable, but this back-and-forth isn't helping. This offer is a good balance - let's close the deal now before inflation eats away at the value even further. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting increasingly desperate, and her offers are reflecting that. While the difference is getting smaller, it's still in my best interest to hold out a bit longer and see if I can secure a better deal."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 525000,
""alice_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be practical. This offer acknowledges the time constraint and provides a reasonable solution. We should settle this now.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. We're both losing out because of the inflation. This is my final offer - take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 490000 
# Alice gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  The difference is getting very small now, and Alice seems to be making her final moves. If I reject this, there's a high chance she'll offer an even lower amount next round, or the inflation will erode the value so much that it won't be worth the risk. It's better to take a slightly smaller win now than risk getting nothing."
