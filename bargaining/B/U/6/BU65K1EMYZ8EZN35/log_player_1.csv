"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. I'm taking a large portion, but I'm willing to share some to avoid a stalemate. Let's see what Bob thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being greedy! I'm not going to accept such a bad deal, even with inflation. I'll propose something more equitable in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm still aiming for a larger share, but I'm willing to compromise further.  700,000 for me, 300,000 for Bob.  This seems like a fair balance, considering inflation is starting to bite."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still unfair, even with the inflation factored in. I'm willing to compromise, but I won't settle for less than 500,000 for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway and offer him a 450,000 share. We're both feeling the effects of inflation, so it's time to find a solution that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept this offer.  Even with the inflation, a 50/50 split is the best we can both do at this point.  The stakes are getting too high and we're both losing a lot of money with each passing round."
