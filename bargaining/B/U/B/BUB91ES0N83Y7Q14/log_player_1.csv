"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and square!""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'm the one who's really driving this deal! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the value of my gain in nominal terms. In this case, I'm being offered $2,000, which is a relatively small share.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate for a better deal.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more given the risk of inflation!""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the value of my gain in nominal terms. In this case, I'm being offered $4,000, which is a bit more than before, but still not as much as I was hoping for.

However, I'm also considering the fact that the money Bob gains is worth less than before, so he's getting a relatively smaller share in real terms. I'll accept this offer to avoid further negotiations and get a slightly better deal.
