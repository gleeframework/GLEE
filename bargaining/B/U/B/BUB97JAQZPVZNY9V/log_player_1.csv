"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm offering Bob 4000 and keeping 6000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about it...

Since the money is worth less now, I'll aim to get a better deal. Bob's offer is a bit more generous than my initial offer, but I still think I can do better.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm trying to be more generous this time, aiming for a 50/50 split."
