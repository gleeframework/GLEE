"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the majority, but leave you a decent chunk. Accept this, and we both get something. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While the offer is better than nothing, it's a very lopsided split.  There are 12 rounds, and I have time to try and negotiate a more even division."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I think a 45/55 split is a fair starting point.  We can both get a good chunk of the money and move on with our lives. Let's be reasonable.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle.  If we don't agree soon, we risk losing a lot of money. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Alice is offering to meet in the middle, it's still a very unequal split.  I'm still hopeful that we can negotiate a more balanced arrangement."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Let's try 40/60.  This is a compromise, but it's closer to a fair split.  We're both losing money with each round, so let's find a solution quickly.""}
