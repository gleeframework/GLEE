"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}

This is a fairly aggressive offer, giving me a large portion of the money. However, as the money is worth 0% less for me per round, I can afford to be more generous than Bob. We'll see how this first round goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get more than 50%, it's a fair offer considering Bob's money is worth less now. Accepting ensures I get something and avoids the risk of getting nothing at all if we reach the end of the 12 rounds."
