"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly and be done with it!""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable and fair way to divide the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering your offer in the previous round. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not going to accept Bob's offer, as it's still a 40% gain for me, and I was hoping for a more even split. I'll try to make a new offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and split it 50/50""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems like a fair compromise considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation."
