"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

This offer gives me 90% of the original $1,000,000, and leaves Bob with $100,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $100,000 is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $80,000. Bob's gain of $900,000 is worth 95% of its original value, which is $855,000.

Considering this, I'll decide to reject the offer.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In this round, my offer is worth 80% of the original value, since the previous round's offer was worth 80% of the original value. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```"
