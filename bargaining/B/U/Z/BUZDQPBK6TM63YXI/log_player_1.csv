"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob! 80/20 is a good starting point.""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $10,000, which is $8,000, and Bob gets 20%, which is $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60/40 is a fairer split, considering the time and effort we'll both put in. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not convinced by Bob's proposal. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'd like to aim for a better split. I'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 70/30 is a more reasonable split considering the reduced value of money due to inflation. What do you think?""}

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the remaining $10,000, which is $7,000, and Bob gets 30%, which is $3,000."
