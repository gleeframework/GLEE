"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10} 
```

I propose keeping the majority of the money, 90$, for myself, and giving Bob 10$. I want to maximize my gains in the first round, knowing the value of the money will decrease for me in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I'd prefer more money, taking 40$ is better than the 72$ I'd get if I reject and go to round 3.  The decreasing value of the money makes accepting this offer the most beneficial."
