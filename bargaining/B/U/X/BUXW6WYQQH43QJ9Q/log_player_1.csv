"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, see how it goes.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'll see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You got lucky on the first round, now it's my turn to take the lead! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take the lead.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer, considering the inflation effect. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, I'll have to decide whether the potential gain is worth it.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60/40 in his favor, I'll try to make a more favorable offer for myself this time. I'll aim for a 55/45 split.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You took a risk by offering 60/40, now it's my turn to take a slightly better deal.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting greedy, but I'll give you a slightly better deal this time 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to make a slightly more generous offer to get me to accept.

Considering the inflation effect, the money I gain in this round is worth even less than in the previous round. I'll have to weigh the potential gain against the decreasing value of the money.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the inflation effect is taking a toll on the value of the money, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a better deal. I'll aim for a 60/40 split in my favor this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Time's running out, and I'm taking a bigger share!""

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, but I'll give you a fair deal before it's too late 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to make a final offer before the value of the money drops too low.

Considering the significant inflation effect, the money I gain in this round is worth a lot less than in the first round. I'll have to think carefully about whether to accept this offer or risk waiting for a better deal.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
