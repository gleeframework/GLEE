Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a good deal for both of us, Alice.  I'm taking a small hit from the inflation to make this work. 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation and is trying to secure a slight advantage.  However, he's still aiming for a larger share than Alice.  By rejecting this offer, Alice maintains her strong negotiating position and increases the pressure on Bob to concede further in the next round."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5100,
""bob_gain"": 4900,
""message"": ""Bob, this is a fair offer, especially considering the inflation. You need to accept that it's impacting your share significantly. Let's close this deal and both benefit.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Apply pressure:**  Bob is now feeling the heat of inflation. Offering him slightly less than what he offered last round emphasizes this and puts the pressure on him.
* **Appear reasonable:** While Alice is taking a stronger stance, offering $4900 (which will be worth even less to Bob after another round) demonstrates some willingness to negotiate. 
* **Urgency:** Reminding Bob of the dwindling overall value adds urgency to the situation and encourages a decision in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, the clock is ticking. This is more than fair considering the inflation is eating away at my share.  Let's be reasonable and end this. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, Bob's offer is the best Alice is likely to get at this point.  Here's why:

* **Inflation is hurting Bob more:**  While Alice is losing potential gains by waiting, the impact of inflation on Bob's share is far more significant. This puts time pressure on him to make a deal.
* **Downward trend:** Bob's offers have been generally trending downwards. By accepting now, Alice locks in a decent amount before Bob potentially offers even less. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a slightly better deal carries the risk of Bob becoming increasingly desperate and offering significantly less, or even reaching a point where no agreement is possible."
