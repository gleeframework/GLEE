350000.0,650000.0,"Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm offering you a larger share than last time, considering the inflation will hit you harder. This is a fair deal.",Bob,2,
,,"While I appreciate the gesture, Bob, that's still a very uneven split. Let's see if we can find something closer to the middle in the next round.",Alice,2,reject
650000.0,350000.0,"Bob, time is ticking and this seems like the fairest split. I get slightly more to compensate for the inflation, which is eating into my share with every round we waste. Deal?",Alice,3,

450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, this back and forth isn't helping anyone. I'm meeting you closer to the middle ground this time. Let's be practical and end this.",Bob,4,
,,"It's true we need to settle this soon, Bob, but I still think a 50/50 split is the fairest option considering the circumstances. I'm willing to negotiate slightly, but that offer is still too far off.",Alice,4,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Okay Bob, last offer.  I'll take a slightly smaller share than previously proposed, reflecting the urgency. This is a compromise, let's wrap it up.",Alice,5,
