"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share this round, but you get a good chunk. We can work something out for the future. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While the offer is tempting, it's important to keep in mind the inflation. By rejecting, I can potentially get a better deal in the future rounds, even though the money will be worth slightly less."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable. I'm willing to give you a good portion, but I need a fair share for myself as well.  We both have to consider the inflation factor -  it's in our best interest to reach a deal now.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your need for a fair share, Bob.  I'm willing to compromise, but this is the most I can give you this round.  We're both losing value with each passing round, so let's find a solution sooner rather than later. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I would prefer a higher percentage, the inflation is a serious factor.  Accepting this offer is the best way to ensure I get a decent share and avoid losing more money due to the devaluation."
