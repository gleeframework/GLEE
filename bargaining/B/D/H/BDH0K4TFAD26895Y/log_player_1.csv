Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable. I'm willing to give you a good portion, but I need a fair share for myself as well.  We both have to consider the inflation factor -  it's in our best interest to reach a deal now. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
