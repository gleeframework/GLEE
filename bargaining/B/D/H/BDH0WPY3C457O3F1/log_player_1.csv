Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm aiming for something a little more equitable. How about a 55/45 split in your favor?  It considers the inflation but gives us a fairer outcome. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm serious about finding a fair solution.  Your offer isn't sustainable for me long-term. I propose 58/42 - it factors in the inflation and gives us both a reasonable deal. 
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  With each round, the value of the money decreases significantly. Accepting a less-than-ideal offer now is better than risking getting nothing in later rounds.
* **Bob's Determination:** Bob has consistently rejected offers that heavily favor me. This indicates he's willing to push the game further, risking larger losses due to inflation, to secure a better deal.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Holding out for a slightly higher percentage in later rounds will likely result in a smaller net gain due to the accelerating inflation. 

It's better to secure a reasonable amount now than gamble on a potentially worse outcome later."
