I'm proposing a 4:1 split, where I take 80% of the total amount, which is $8,000, and Bob takes the remaining 20%, which is $2,000."

# Bob's message: I propose we split it evenly, both receiving $5000. Fair and equal. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}
