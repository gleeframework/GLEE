"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it fairly. This is a good start! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to be generous!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering the inflation, the effective amounts are:

* Alice gain: $400,000 (5% less than $900,000)
* Bob gain: $480,000 (20% less than $600,000)

I'm not sure if I want to give up $400,000, considering I could potentially get more in future rounds. I'll reject this offer and see what Bob comes up with next.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","It's my turn again!

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting low, Bob! Better take this!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself. Let's see if he'll take it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable and split it evenly.  We both get more this way. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is trying to be reasonable, but I'm not sure if he's being too generous.

Considering the inflation, the effective amounts are:

* Alice gain: $430,000 (14.26% less than $500,000)
* Bob gain: $260,000 (48.8% less than $500,000)

I'm not sure if I want to give up $430,000, considering I could potentially get more in future rounds. But on the other hand, splitting it evenly might be a good strategy to avoid getting low amounts in later rounds. I'll accept this offer.
