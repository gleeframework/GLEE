Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a slightly unfair offer, giving myself 90% and Bob 10%. I'm hoping this will encourage him to accept quickly, as the money will be worth less with each passing round.  Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is much fairer, and with each round, the value of the money decreases. Accepting this offer ensures I get at least half of the remaining value."
