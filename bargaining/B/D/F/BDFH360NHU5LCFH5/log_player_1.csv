"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making an offer.

Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the original amount, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think for a moment...

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'd rather get a larger share now, while it's still worth something. I'll accept Bob's offer.
