"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good deal!""
}
```

I'm willing to give Bob 40% of the money, which I think is a generous offer. Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try 55-45, it's more fair! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think I can get a better deal than 45% of the money, even considering the inflation. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:


{
  ""alice_gain"": 5800,
  ""bob_gain"": 4200,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, 58-42 is the way to go!""
}

I'm taking into account the inflation, but I still think I can get a bit more than 50%. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the bigger share this time! 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

Considering the inflation, I think 4200 is a reasonable amount, and I don't want to risk losing even more value in the next round. I'll accept this offer!"
