"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the majority, but you get a decent share. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While it's tempting to take the $1000, remember the inflation. If we go to the next round, I'll get to make the offer and I can get more than that!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm taking a bigger share this time, but we both get a good amount.  Let's settle this now.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's compromise. We're both losing money with each round, so let's settle for a more even split. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a more even split, the inflation is starting to hurt. This is a decent deal considering the circumstances, and it's better than getting nothing if we keep going."
