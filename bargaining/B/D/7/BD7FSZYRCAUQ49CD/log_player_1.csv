"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can negotiate from here""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money equally. This ensures a fair outcome and avoids further negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I accept Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think an equal split is a fair outcome, and it's better than risking further negotiation and potentially ending up with less."
