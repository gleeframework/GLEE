"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 
 
I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. This is a generous offer, considering the inflation that will affect Bob more significantly in the future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer ensures I get something. The inflation will be more significant in the future rounds, potentially leading to a worse outcome for me."
