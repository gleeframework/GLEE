Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than a 60/40 split.  Let's go with 55/45, which gives me a slightly larger share, but still a fair deal. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
