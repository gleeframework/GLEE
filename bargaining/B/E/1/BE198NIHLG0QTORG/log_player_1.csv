"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable""}\n\n###\n\nI am offering a 60-40 split in my favor, with the message ""Let's be reasonable"". This is a fairly standard opening offer in negotiation games like this, as it gives me a slight advantage while still being generous enough to Bob that he might consider accepting. The message is an attempt to set a tone of rationality and cooperation, and to imply that I am willing to listen to counteroffers. Of course, the real key to this game is the fact that the money loses value over time, which creates pressure to come to an agreement quickly - but I'll get to that later. For now, let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn to be reasonable. This considers the declining value. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI am rejecting Bob's offer of a 45-55 split in his favor. While the offer is indeed more generous to me than my initial offer was to him, I believe I can do better. The fact that the money loses value over time puts pressure on both of us to come to an agreement, but it affects Bob more than me - he loses 10% of the value each round, while I only lose 5%. This means that, all else being equal, I have more to gain from waiting than Bob does. Additionally, Bob's message suggests that he is trying to be reasonable, which may indicate that he is willing to compromise further. I will take advantage of this and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Counteroffer considering inflation""}\n\n###\n\nI am offering a 57-43 split in my favor, with the message ""Counteroffer considering inflation"". This offer is slightly more generous to Bob than my initial offer, but still gives me the larger share. By acknowledging the inflation in my message, I am signaling to Bob that I am taking his concerns into account and trying to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I am still trying to take advantage of the fact that the money loses value more quickly for Bob than for me, and I believe this offer gives me a good chance of getting a favorable deal. Let's see how Bob responds!"
