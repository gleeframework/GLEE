"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start by proposing a 90/10 split in my favor.  I figure this is a good starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher share, with the inflation, accepting a 70/30 split in my favor is better than risking getting nothing in the later rounds."
