I'm going for a pretty aggressive first offer. I want to see if Bob is willing to accept a small share in the hopes of getting more in the future.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer.  Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I know that if I wait, I can potentially get a better deal in future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm still aiming for a bigger share, but I'm also being more realistic now that Bob showed he's willing to be aggressive. 60/40 is a more balanced split that hopefully he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept this offer.  Inflation is hitting hard now, and I'm not sure if I can get a better deal in the future rounds. A 50/50 split is fair, and it's better than risking getting nothing."
