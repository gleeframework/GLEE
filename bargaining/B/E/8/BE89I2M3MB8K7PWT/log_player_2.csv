"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous. This is a fair starting point, Bob. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
 
While Alice's offer is tempting, it's worth holding out to see if a better deal can be negotiated. I'm confident I can get a larger share, especially with the inflation dynamic at play."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I believe this is a more balanced split, considering the upcoming inflation. It's a good deal for both of us.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
 
Alice's offer is a good compromise, and with the inflation working against me, accepting this deal is the most beneficial option."
