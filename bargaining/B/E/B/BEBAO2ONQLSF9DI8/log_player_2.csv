"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Since my money is worth 10% more than yours now, I'll take a bit more. Let's settle this. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is starting to use the time pressure and inflation difference to her advantage. While her offer isn't terrible, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal in the next few rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""The inflation is hurting both of us. Let's be practical and split it evenly. This is a fair deal and saves us both from further losses.""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Time Pressure:** With each round, the value of the money decreases. It's crucial to reach an agreement soon.
* **Shift in Strategy:**  Alice is using the time pressure to her advantage. By offering a 50/50 split, I'm demonstrating a willingness to be fair and emphasizing the negative impact of inflation on both of us. This hopefully encourages her to settle instead of continuing to push for a larger share."
