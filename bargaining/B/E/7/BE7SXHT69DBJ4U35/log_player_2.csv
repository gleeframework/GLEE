It's always good to try to negotiate a better deal, especially when there's inflation involved. Let's see if we can get more!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is fairer, given the potential for inflation.  What do you think?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55/45 is a more reasonable split, considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd still prefer the 60/40 split, Alice's offer is a decent compromise considering the inflation. Accepting this ensures I get something and avoids the risk of getting even less in future rounds."
