"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take $9,000 and you get $1,000. Accept and we can finish the game.""
}
```

This offer gives me the majority of the money, but still leaves Bob with a significant amount. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more balanced split is better for both of us. Let's try 5500 for me and 4500 for you. This way, we both get a good share and can avoid the risk of losing money to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't want to give Bob too much, but I also don't want to risk losing more money to inflation. Considering the reduced value of money due to inflation, I think Bob's proposal is reasonable.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
