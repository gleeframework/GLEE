"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair to start with."

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to be more careful with my decision.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now.

I'm offering a slightly more favorable split to Bob, hoping he'll accept this time."
