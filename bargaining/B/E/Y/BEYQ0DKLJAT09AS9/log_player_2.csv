Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting us nowhere fast.  I came down a bit, you came up a bit.  Deal? 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm still holding out for a better deal.  Let's see what happens next round."

""alice_gain"": 45,

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time here.  This is my final offer. 60/40.  Take it and we both walk away with something. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60

It's getting risky to keep rejecting offers.  I'll take the 40 and avoid further inflation."
