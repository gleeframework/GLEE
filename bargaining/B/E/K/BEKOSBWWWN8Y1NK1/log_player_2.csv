I'm Bob, and I'm going to try to get a better deal. Even though Alice is proposing a seemingly fair split, the money will be worth less to me in the next round.  Let's see if I can negotiate a better outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you 40% of the money, but I need to get a better deal for myself. It's only fair, considering inflation will eat away at my share in the next round.""}

# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

While Alice's offer seems generous considering inflation, I'm still not convinced. I need to maximize my gains as much as possible.  I'll see if I can secure a better deal in the next round."

{""decision"": ""reject""}

# Alice's message: You're running out of time, and inflation is killing your share. This is a good deal, don't be greedy! 
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
