"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, a fair starting point""}

I'm proposing a 4:1 split, where I take 80% of the initial $10,000 and Bob takes 20%. This is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's compromise 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the compromise, but I'll consider it.

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll take the 4000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. It's better than getting nothing, and I'm hoping Bob will be more willing to negotiate further in future rounds."
