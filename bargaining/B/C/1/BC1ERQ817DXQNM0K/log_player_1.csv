"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40, which is a relatively generous amount considering the inflation factor. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game here!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is a good starting point, reflecting our different inflation rates. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to turn the tables on me!

I'll reject his offer since it's the same as my initial offer, and I was hoping for a better deal considering the inflation rates.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation rates, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more given the inflation""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but still trying to get a better deal for myself."
