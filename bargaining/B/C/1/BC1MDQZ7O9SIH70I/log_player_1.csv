"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}

I'm offering a 50-50 split to start the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer for Round 2.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'm rejecting this offer because I'd rather wait for a better deal, considering the money is worth 5% less for Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","In Round 3, I'll propose a slightly better deal for myself to account for the inflation:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}

I'm offering a 55-45 split, hoping Bob will accept this time."
