"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a proposal. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

This means I'm proposing that I get $600,000 and Bob gets $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 5% less, I'll calculate the actual amounts:

Alice gain: 300,000 * 0.95 = 285,000
Bob gain: 700,000 * 0.95 = 665,000

I'll reject this offer. The difference in the amounts is too large, and I think I can do better.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts considering the inflation:

Alice gain: 450,000 * 0.851 (1 - 0.149) = 382,550
Bob gain: 550,000 * 0.851 (1 - 0.149) = 469,355

I'll reject this offer. The difference in the amounts is still too large, and I think I can do better.

# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts considering the inflation:

Bob gain: 600,000 * 0.777 (1 - 0.223) = 466,200
