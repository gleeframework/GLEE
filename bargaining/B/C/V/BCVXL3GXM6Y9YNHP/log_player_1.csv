# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I was expecting a more competitive offer from Bob!

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 20% less, I'll have to consider the long-term implications of accepting this offer.
