"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

This offer gives Alice the vast majority of the money, but it is still a small amount for Bob, which might be enough to entice him to accept. I'm playing it safe in the first round, as the inflation will affect Bob more than me in the later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly better for him, and even though the inflation will affect his gain, he will still receive a much larger share than in the previous round. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

This offer is a 50/50 split. I'm aiming for a fair division this time.  I'm hoping that after seeing the inflation affect the value of his gains in the last round, Bob will be more amenable to a more balanced split."
