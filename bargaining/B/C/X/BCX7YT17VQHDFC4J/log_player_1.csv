Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. I propose a 50/50 split. We can end this quickly and avoid any potential losses due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already starting to bite!

I'm not sure I want to give up 50% of the remaining money, considering the value of the money is decreasing with each round. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money! I need to be careful not to give up too much.

A 45/55 split is closer to what I was initially offering, but I'm not sure I want to give up that much more. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.
