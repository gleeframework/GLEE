"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, hoping to set a fair tone for the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, but I think I deserve more since I'm the one making the offer 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. Considering the inflation, my gain of $40 is actually worth $38 (95% of $40).

I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with the 60/40 split, especially since I was hoping for a more even split. But I also don't want to risk waiting for a better offer, and Bob's offer is still better than a 0% gain.

I'll accept this offer for now.
