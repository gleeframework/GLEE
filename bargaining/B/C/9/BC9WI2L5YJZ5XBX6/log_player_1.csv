Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split, which seems fair and reasonable for the first round."

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me, I'll have to adjust my expectations. Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting the offer because I think I can do better, considering the inflation effect."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 20% less for me, I'll aim to get a bit more than 50% of the remaining amount. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer."

Do you accept this offer?","Considering the rapid inflation, I need to adjust my expectations even further. Since the money is worth 48.8% less for me, I'll have to be more cautious. However, Bob's offer is still relatively close to the initial 50/50 split, but slightly skewed in his favor. I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting the offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
