"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start, no need to negotiate too hard!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to begin with, hoping to set a fair tone for the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted to start with an even split, but I think I can do better than that! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks he can do better than a 50-50 split, huh?

Considering the money is worth 10% less now, I'll have to adjust my strategy. Since Bob's offer is 60-40 in his favor, I'll try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Time for a counteroffer!

Since the money is worth 20% less now (10% less in each of the two previous rounds), I'll aim to get a better share. I'll offer a 55-45 split in my favor.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You think you can do better? Let's see how you like this!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting a bit more aggressive, but I'm still not impressed 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is sticking to his guns!

Considering the money is worth 27.1% less now (10% less in each of the three previous rounds), I'll try to adjust my strategy. Since Bob's offer is still 55.5-44.5 in his favor, I'll aim to get an even better deal.

However, I'll also consider the fact that Bob's message suggests he's not impressed with my previous offer, so I might need to be more cautious.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Time for another counteroffer!

Considering the money is worth 37.1% less now (10% less in each of the four previous rounds), I'll aim to get a better share. I'll offer a 60-40 split in my favor.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not backing down, let's see if you'll meet me halfway!""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging, but I'll meet you halfway... this time 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is willing to meet me halfway, but I'm not sure if it's the best deal I can get.

Considering the money is worth 40.95% less now (10% less in each of the five previous rounds), I'll have to think carefully about this offer. A 50-50 split is better than the previous offers, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

However, since Bob's message suggests he's willing to meet me halfway, I'll take the deal.
