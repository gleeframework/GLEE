Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm aiming for a slightly more balanced split. How about 45/55? 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical solution. Take it while it's still on the table. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While a 50/50 split seems fair in principle, the constant inflation puts me at a significant disadvantage.  Bob is consistently getting the full value while my potential gains decrease each round. I need to push for a better split while it's still early enough to make a difference."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6200,
""bob_gain"": 3800,
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering 62/38.  This is a compromise, and it's the last offer I'm making above 60%.  We need to settle this before inflation eats away at the value.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it's clear we both want this over. I'm offering 52/48. It's a strong offer considering the inflation working in my favor. Let's be done with this. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision, but Bob's offer is still heavily skewed in his favor, especially considering the accumulated inflation. While 48% is tempting, accepting it sets a bad precedent and implies I'm willing to settle for significantly less. I need to show firmness, even if it means risking a worse outcome later."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm dropping my demand to 60/40 again to show I'm willing to compromise.  Take it or leave it - time is literally money for me!""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Time pressure:**  With six rounds left, the pressure is on. I need to signal that I'm serious about reaching an agreement soon. 
* **Strategic Retreat:** By slightly lowering my demand (even though it's a repeat of Round 1's offer), I appear more flexible and hopefully incentivize Bob to negotiate more earnestly. 
* **Strong Language:** The message is more direct, emphasizing the urgency and the real cost of delay caused by the inflation mechanic."
