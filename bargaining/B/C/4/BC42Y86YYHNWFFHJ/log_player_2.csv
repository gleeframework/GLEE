Alice's offer:

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out, and the value is decreasing. I'm proposing 65/35. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering 62/38.  This is a compromise, and it's the last offer I'm making above 60%.  We need to settle this before inflation eats away at the value. 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation, and her offers are getting increasingly desperate.  While not ideal, I'm willing to hold out a bit longer to see if I can secure a better deal.  The longer this goes on, the more the power shifts in my favor."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Alice, it's clear we both want this over. I'm offering 52/48. It's a strong offer considering the inflation working in my favor. Let's be done with this.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm increasing my ask slightly to take advantage of my increasingly strong position.  Alice's desperation is growing, and this offer, while still potentially a compromise on my end, reflects the changing power dynamic."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm dropping my demand to 60/40 again to show I'm willing to compromise.  Take it or leave it - time is literally money for me! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  While not ideal, accepting a 60/40 split at this stage is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** With only 5 rounds remaining, the risk of walking away with nothing significantly increases. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  While Alice is feeling the pressure of inflation more acutely,  continuing to push my advantage could backfire and lead to her making even riskier, less favorable offers. 
* **Guaranteed Gain:** Accepting now guarantees me $4000. Holding out for a slightly better split in later rounds carries a significant risk of ending up with nothing. 

This decision prioritizes a guaranteed win over the potential for a slightly higher, but riskier, gain."
