# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making a decision.

Since the money is worth 10% less for Bob each round, I'll try to take advantage of that. My initial offer was $9,000, which is still a good amount. However, Bob's offer of $6,000 for me is lower than my initial offer, and I'm not sure if I want to settle for less.

I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal in the next round.
