"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You got a bit greedy, let's try a more balanced split this time! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Thanks for the update on the inflation rate.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll think for a moment...

I'll reject this offer. I'd like to negotiate further to get a better share. The 30-70 split is too skewed towards Bob's favor, especially considering the inflation factor.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle this time""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems like a fair and balanced division of the remaining $100. Your turn, Bob!"
