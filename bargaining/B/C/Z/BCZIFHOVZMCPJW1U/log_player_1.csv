I'm going to be greedy and propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor.  It's unlikely Bob will accept this on the first round, but it's a starting point.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being just as greedy as I was! I'm not going to accept that offer.  Let's see if we can reach a more fair compromise in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

I'm going to propose a 5500/4500 split.  This is a more fair offer, and it's closer to a 50/50 split, which is more likely to be accepted."
