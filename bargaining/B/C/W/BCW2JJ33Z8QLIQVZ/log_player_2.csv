Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to 6000, but I'm not going lower. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 
 
Although Alice's offer is better, I'm willing to gamble a bit more. The inflation is hitting her harder, so she'll be more desperate in the next round. Let's see if I can get a better deal."
