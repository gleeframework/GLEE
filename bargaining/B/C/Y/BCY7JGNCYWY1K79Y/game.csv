6000.0,4000.0,Let's split the money 60/40. It's a good deal for both of us in the first round.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,I think 55/45 is a fair split considering the inflation,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"I understand the inflation is affecting us both. Let's settle this now with a 55/45 split in my favor. This is the same split you proposed last round, but with the value adjusted fairly for the current round.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4200.0,5800.0,"Considering the increasing inflation impact, especially on your side, I think 58/42 is a reasonable adjustment",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Bob, it's clear we're both trying to maximize our gains, but this is getting ridiculous. The inflation is hurting us both.  Let's split it evenly at 50/50 and end this before we both lose out even more.",Alice,5,
