Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to be greedy and try to get the majority of the money on the first round. I'll offer Bob a small amount, hoping he'll accept it to avoid the risk of getting nothing later.  Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is fair and offers me a significant amount of money, especially considering the potential for further inflation. I'm going to accept and avoid the risk of getting nothing."
