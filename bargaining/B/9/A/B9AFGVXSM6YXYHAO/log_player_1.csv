"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 400k, a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my 400k is now worth less than 50% of the original amount. I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round due to inflation, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to compensate for the loss in value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You offered 400k, I'm willing to give you 450k, but I need a bit more for myself to account for inflation.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, 55/45 split 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to meet me halfway, but considering the inflation, I'm still not getting the value I want. The 55/45 split is closer to what I wanted, but I'm still losing out on some value.

I'll accept this offer, as it's a reasonable compromise given the current situation.
