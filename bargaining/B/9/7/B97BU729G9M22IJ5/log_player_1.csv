"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you get 40%""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You took 60%, I'll take 70% this time. It's a better deal for you to accept now. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure if it's really a better deal for me, and I'm not convinced that 30% is a fair share for me. I'd like to make another proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. 55% for me, 45% for you. It's a fair split.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
