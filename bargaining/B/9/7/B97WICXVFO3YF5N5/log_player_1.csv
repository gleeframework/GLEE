I'm starting with a fairly aggressive offer.  I'm hoping to get a good chunk of the money before the inflation kicks in too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer to get more money, I don't want to risk getting nothing at all. 50% is a fair compromise, especially with inflation eating into our gains."
