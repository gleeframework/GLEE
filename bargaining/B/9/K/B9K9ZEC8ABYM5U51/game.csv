4000.0,6000.0,"I understand you want a larger share, but that offer is too low for me. How about a 60/40 split in my favor? This seems more reasonable.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
6500.0,3500.0,"Okay, let's compromise. I'll take 65% and you get 35%. This is still a good deal for both of us, and we can avoid further rounds of negotiation.",Alice,3,
