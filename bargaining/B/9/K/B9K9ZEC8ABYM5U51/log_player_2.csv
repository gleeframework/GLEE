Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's compromise. I'll take 65% and you get 35%. This is still a good deal for both of us, and we can avoid further rounds of negotiation.

# Alice gain: 6500
