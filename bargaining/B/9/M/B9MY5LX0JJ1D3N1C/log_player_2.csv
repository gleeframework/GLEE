Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate the urgency, but I'm not ready to settle for 52 yet. Meet me in the middle of our last offers. 
# Bob gain: 44

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation, but she's still trying to hold out for a better deal.  While her offer is getting closer to a more even split, it's still beneficial for me to push a bit further.  Each round that passes hurts her more than it hurts me."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""This is it - a perfectly even split. Let's stop wasting time and both walk away with something!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's time to play hardball and go for the most advantageous outcome for me.  While I could potentially squeeze out a slightly larger share by continuing to play chicken, the risk is too high.  

* **Diminishing returns:**  The difference between getting 50 and, say, 52 is becoming increasingly negligible as inflation eats away at the value.
* **Risk of losing everything:** If Alice doesn't budge and we run out of rounds, we both get nothing.  A 50/50 split guarantees me a reasonable share, even if it's not the absolute maximum. 

This offer is a strong signal that I'm serious about reaching an agreement and willing to be fair, but I'm not interested in further concessions."
