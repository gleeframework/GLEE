"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose to keep almost all of the money and give Bob just $1. It's a bit of a bold move, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it, knowing that if he rejects, he has a 50% chance of getting nothing at all in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It's a fair offer, and I'm not sure I'll be able to do better than this in the next round."
