Bob's offer:

# Bob gain: 400000

While not ideal, accepting this offer guarantees a reasonable gain for you.  Bob's offers are unlikely to significantly improve, and the longer we wait, the more he loses to inflation, increasing the pressure on him to make a deal.  It's better to secure a good amount now than risk getting nothing later."
