Round 2

# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the money is worth less, but I'll have to make a decision based on the current offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure 30 is fair, I was thinking more like 55 or 60. Can you meet me in the middle?""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and suggesting a compromise, hoping he'll meet me in the middle."

}

# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25
