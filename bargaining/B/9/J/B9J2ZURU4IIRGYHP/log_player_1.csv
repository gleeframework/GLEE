"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 20% of the money, is that fair?""
}
```

This offer gives me 80% of the initial $1,000,000, which is a relatively generous offer considering the inflation will reduce the value of the money over time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a fair share, but not too generous 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering the offer, I think I can do better than 45% of the remaining money. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate for more.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation affecting the value of the money, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 40% of the money, but I think I deserve more""
}
```

This offer gives me 60% of the remaining $1,000,000, which is a bit more aggressive than my initial offer, but considering the inflation, I think it's a fair request."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give away too much 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll on the value of the money!

Considering the offer, I think I can still do better than 40% of the remaining money. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate for more.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation continuing to erode the value of the money, I'll try to negotiate an even better deal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 45% of the money, but I think I'm getting a bit desperate""
}
```

This offer gives me 55% of the remaining $1,000,000, which is a bit more aggressive than my previous offers, considering the value of the money is decreasing rapidly."
