"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
 
I propose to keep 9000$ and give Bob 1000$. This way, I maximize my gain in the first round, before inflation affects the value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
I accept Bob's offer. While I'm getting less than I initially wanted, Bob's offer is still fair considering the inflation.  I'm happy to get 5000$ and avoid further rounds of negotiation."
