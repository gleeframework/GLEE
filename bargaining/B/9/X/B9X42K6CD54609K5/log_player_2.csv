"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's meet closer to the middle. This offer is still in your favor considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, the clock is ticking. I'm being reasonable, let's close this deal. 
# Bob gain: 4900 
# Alice gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the offer is getting closer to a more even split, time is not the primary pressure point yet. Accepting an offer where I get less than Alice is unacceptable given the inflation working against me.  I need to signal I'm willing to risk it going to later rounds to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5400, ""alice_gain"": 4600, ""message"": ""Time is money Alice, and we're both losing it.  This is a strong offer considering the circumstances.""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintain a firm stance:** Continuing to counter-propose with a slight advantage for myself keeps the pressure on Alice.  I can't appear desperate, even with the inflation.
* **Slight concession:** I've lowered my demand by $100 to show some flexibility and potentially entice Alice to take the deal. 
* **Time pressure:**  Emphasize that each round wasted is a loss for both of us, subtly increasing the pressure on Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is it. I'm offering a near even split, take it or leave it. The inflation means every round costs us both. 
# Bob gain: 4950 
# Alice gain: 5050 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough call, but the risk outweighs the potential reward at this point. Here's why:

* **Near Even Split:** Alice is correct; the offer is very close to even. Considering the inflation working against me, getting a slightly worse deal now is better than risking getting a much worse deal later. 
* **Time Pressure:**  With only 5 rounds left, the inflation will seriously cut into any potential gains.  Waiting any longer drastically increases the risk of getting a much smaller amount, even if I win a later offer. 
* **Alice's Tone:** Her ""take it or leave it"" language suggests she's unlikely to budge further. 

While not ideal, accepting this offer guarantees a reasonably fair share of the money and avoids the risk of walking away with nothing."
