# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While the money is losing value for Bob, he's still trying to inch closer to a larger share.  My offer in Round 3 was already a compromise, acknowledging the inflation. I'll hold out a bit longer and see if he's willing to negotiate more fairly."

```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is feeling the pressure of the inflation, but he's still trying to take a larger share than I'm comfortable with. His offer is getting closer to a point I might consider, but I'm willing to risk another round to see if he'll become more reasonable."
