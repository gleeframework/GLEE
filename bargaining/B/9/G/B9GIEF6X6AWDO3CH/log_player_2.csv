**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the fact that the money loses value faster for her. However, accepting a deal where I consistently get less than 50% is not in my best interest, even with the inflation. I need to hold out for a better offer, closer to even, and leverage the fact that she's more desperate for a deal as time goes on."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 510000,
""alice_gain"": 490000,
""message"": ""This is my final offer.  Take it or leave it - we're running out of time.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to play hardball. I'm offering slightly more than half, acknowledging the inflation pressure, but making it clear this is the best she'll get. The ""final offer"" stance adds pressure for her to accept now."
