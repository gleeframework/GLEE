Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nA 50/50 split is indeed a fair and logical solution, especially considering the significant impact of inflation on both our shares. Continuing to negotiate further may lead to both of us losing more value than we gain from the money. Accepting this offer ensures we both walk away with something substantial, rather than risking it all."
