"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can wrap up the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Splitting it down the middle is a good starting point, but I'm hoping to get a bit more 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept a 50-50 split, especially since I'm losing value due to inflation. I'd like to propose a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I should get a bit more since I'm losing value due to inflation""}

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which is a bit more favorable to me since I'm losing value due to inflation. I'm hoping Bob will consider this offer and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think I should get a larger share to account for the inflation 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept a 45-55 split, especially since I'm losing value at a higher rate due to inflation. I think I should get a bit more to compensate for the decreasing value of my share. I'd like to propose a new offer that takes into account the increasing disparity in the value of our shares."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think I should get a bit more to account for the increasing inflation""}

I'm proposing a 52-48 split, which is a bit more favorable to me since I'm losing value at a higher rate due to inflation. I'm hoping Bob will consider this offer and accept it."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting a bit impatient, I think I should get the majority to make up for the lost value 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept a 40-60 split, especially since I'm losing value at an alarming rate due to inflation. I think I should get a bit more to compensate for the decreasing value of my share. I'd like to propose a new offer that takes into account the increasing disparity in the value of our shares.

I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not be able to agree on a split before the 12th round, and I'm worried that we'll both end up with nothing. I'm hoping Bob will consider a more reasonable offer from me in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and split it evenly again, but I think this should be the last chance to do so""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is the same as the original offer from Bob in round 2. I'm hoping that Bob will accept this offer and we can finally agree on a split before it's too late."
