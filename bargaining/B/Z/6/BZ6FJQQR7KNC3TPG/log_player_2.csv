"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take 80% and you get 20%. You can try to do better in the next round if you want. 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly this time, Alice. It's a fair deal, and we can both get a good amount.""}

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still not satisfied with the split. I'll take 60% this time, and we can reassess in the next round. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While the offer is tempting, I want to try to negotiate a better deal for myself.  I still have time and can try to reach a more even split."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
