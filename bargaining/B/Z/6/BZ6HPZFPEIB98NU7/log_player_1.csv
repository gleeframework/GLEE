"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5}
```

I propose to take $95 and give Bob $5.  Since I'm the first to propose, I'm taking the lion's share!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I accept Bob's offer. While I would prefer more, inflation means my gains are worth less each round, and I'm not sure if I can get a better deal in the future. It's better to take what I can get now."
