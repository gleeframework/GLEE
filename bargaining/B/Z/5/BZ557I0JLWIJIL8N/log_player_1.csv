"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This offer gives me a large share, but leaves Bob with a small amount. I'm hoping this will incentivize him to accept the offer in the first round, avoiding further rounds and inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more than 5000, with inflation, my share is worth less than in the previous round. It's better to accept this offer and secure a decent amount, rather than risk further inflation and potentially get less in the next round."
