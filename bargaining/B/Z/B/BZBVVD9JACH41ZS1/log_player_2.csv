While Alice's offer is not ideal, she is gaining much less than she was in the first round. This is due to inflation, and the risk of losing everything in the last few rounds is high. Accepting this offer is the best way to ensure that Bob gets at least something, and Alice doesn't get nearly as much as she did initially."
