"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm offering you 40 dollars, and I'll take 60 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob has made the same offer as I did in Round 1.

Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, I'll consider the offer in terms of the new value. 

I'll calculate the actual amount I would gain: 40 * 0.8 = 32

I'll calculate the actual amount Bob would gain: 60 * 0.95 = 57

Considering the reduced value due to inflation, I'll decide to accept this offer.
