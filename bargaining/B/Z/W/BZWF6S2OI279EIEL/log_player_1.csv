"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is 40% of the total amount. This way, we both get a significant amount of money, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still not giving away too much. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I need to reassess the offer.

In this round, the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, so my gain of $450,000 is equivalent to $427,500 in the first round's value.

Considering the offer, I think I can do better than this. I'll reject the offer and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll make a counteroffer. Your turn!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 5% less again, I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to find a middle ground. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but still trying to keep a decent amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

# Bob gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are starting to add up!

With the money being worth 14.26% less than in the first round, my gain of $380,000 is equivalent to $333,333 in the first round's value.

Considering the offer, I think I can do better than this. I'll reject the offer and make a counteroffer.
