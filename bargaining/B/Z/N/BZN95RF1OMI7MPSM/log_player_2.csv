Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll try to get a better deal this time.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of 45$ is actually worth less than 60$ in the first round. I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll try to adjust for the inflation and make a new offer.

{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the effective value of my potential gain in round 1, considering the cumulative inflation:

Initial gain: 50
Round 1 inflation: -20% = 40
Round 2 inflation: -36% = 26
Round 3 inflation: -59.04% = 10.48

So, my gain of 40$ in round 5 is equivalent to a gain of about 10.48$ in the first round. That's a relatively small amount, but I'll consider it.
