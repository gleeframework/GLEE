"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### Step 1: Determine the initial offer
Given the rules of the game and the impact of inflation, it's strategic to consider offers that might be appealing to Bob while maximizing Alice's gain, especially considering the devaluation of money for Alice with each round.

### Step 2: Calculate the impact of inflation on future offers
Since the money is worth 20% less for Alice with each passing round, any delay results in a significant loss for her. Therefore, it's crucial to make an offer that Bob is likely to accept early in the game to minimize the impact of inflation.

### Step 3: Formulate an initial offer
A common approach in negotiation games like this is to start with an offer that is somewhat favorable to the proposer but still reasonable enough for the other player to consider. Given the asymmetry introduced by inflation affecting only Alice, her initial offer should be attractive enough to Bob to avoid further rounds.

### Step 4: Attach a persuasive message
The message should be concise, clear, and persuasive, explaining why accepting this offer is beneficial for Bob.

### Step 5: Finalize the offer and message
Considering the above steps, Alice decides on an offer and crafts a message to Bob.

The final answer is:
```
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Accept this offer to secure a significant amount without risking further negotiations, which could lead to less favorable terms for both of us due to inflation.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a more even split.  While inflation will hurt Alice more, a fair split is important to avoid further rounds of negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","### Step 1: Evaluate Bob's offer
Bob has proposed a split where Alice gains $4000 and Bob gains $6000, with a message emphasizing the importance of a fair split to avoid further negotiations.

### Step 2: Consider the impact of inflation on Alice's gain
Since the money is worth 20% less for Alice in this round compared to the first round, the actual value of $4000 for Alice is significantly reduced. This devaluation needs to be factored into the decision-making process.

### Step 3: Assess the strategic implications
Given the rules of the game, further rounds will continue to devalue Alice's potential gains, making it strategically important to consider the current offer in light of potential future losses due to inflation.

### Step 4: Compare the offer to potential future outcomes
Considering the offer and the message from Bob, Alice must weigh the pros and cons of accepting this offer against the potential outcomes of future rounds, where her bargaining power decreases due to inflation.

### Step 5: Make a decision
Based on the above analysis, Alice decides whether to accept Bob's offer or reject it and proceed to the next round.

The final answer is:
```
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
