"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can split the difference!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's end this! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth even less due to inflation.

I'm not sure if I should accept Bob's offer, considering the reduced value of the money. Since we're meeting halfway, I'll get $500,000, which is worth 95% of $900,000 (the value of my share in the previous round).

I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal for Round 3."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll make a new proposal that takes this into account.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 810000,
  ""bob_gain"": 190000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting the better deal, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share, but I'm hoping he'll still accept and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting too greedy, meet me in the middle again! 
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is biting!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll think about Bob's new offer. In this round, the money is worth significantly less due to inflation.

I'll calculate the value of my potential gain: $700,000 is worth 70% of $1,000,000 (the original value), which is 70% of 95% of $1,000,000 (the value in the second round).

Let me see...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. It's not the best deal, but it's better than risking further inflation and getting an even smaller share."
