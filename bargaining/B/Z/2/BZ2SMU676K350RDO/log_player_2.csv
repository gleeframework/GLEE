Round 5

# Alice's message: Considering inflation, I can only go down to 57. 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is heavily undervaluing the impact of inflation on her returns. While she's focusing on nominal dollar amounts, we need to consider the *real* value of the money after inflation.  I'm willing to negotiate, but not when she's getting such a disproportionate benefit."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 47, ""alice_gain"": 53, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're aiming for a higher initial share, but inflation is rapidly eroding the value of your potential gains. This offer is a compromise, reflecting the reality of our situation.""}

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can compromise, but I need a bit more than that. 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clinging to a higher nominal amount, but the reality is that inflation is eating into her share significantly. While her offer has inched closer to a compromise, it's still not reflecting the real value of the money after inflation. I need to continue pushing for a more equitable split."

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, we need to be realistic.  The value of this deal diminishes with each round that passes. Let's split it evenly and avoid losing everything.""}
