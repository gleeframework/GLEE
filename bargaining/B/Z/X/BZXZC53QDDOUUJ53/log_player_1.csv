"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money 90/10. I'll give you a fair share.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 10% share, and I'll take the remaining 90%. This is a generous offer, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You could have gotten more in round 1, now I'm taking a smaller share 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","In the second round, the money is worth 10% less for me, so the actual amount I would gain is 400000 * 0.9 = 360000.

Bob's offer is 400000 for me and 600000 for him, but I don't know how much he values the money, since the inflation effect on him is different.

I'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round. I'm hoping to do better in the next round.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In the third round, the money is worth 10% less than in the second round, so the actual amount I would gain is 400000 * 0.9 = 360000 * 0.9 = 324000.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly bigger share, but I still think 70/30 is a fair split.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","In the fourth round, the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, so the actual amount I would gain is 900000 * 0.723 = 649100.

Bob's offer is 450000 for me and 550000 for him. I'll accept this offer, as it's a better deal than my previous offer and it's getting late in the game.
