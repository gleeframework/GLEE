"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'm reasonable.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, but still willing to negotiate 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $30 is worth 20% less than the $60 I proposed in the first round, so it's equivalent to $48 in terms of purchasing power.

I don't think Bob's offer is reasonable, considering the inflation. I'd like to make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with your offer, I'll make a counteroffer""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain is worth 40% less than the initial $60 I proposed, so it's equivalent to $36 in terms of purchasing power. I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of money.

```

  ""alice_gain"": 40,

  ""message"": ""Meet me halfway, let's end this""
