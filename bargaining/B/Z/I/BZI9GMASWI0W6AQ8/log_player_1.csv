"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since I'm Alice, I'm trying to maximize my gains. In the first round, I'm assuming Bob is unaware of the inflation effect. By offering him a tiny portion, I'm hoping he'll accept it out of greed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:** My gains are now worth 20% less.
* **Opportunity Cost:** If I reject this offer, the next round will have even lower value for my gains due to inflation. 
* **Bob's Fairness:**  While Bob is taking a larger portion, it's still a reasonable split considering the inflation factor. 

It's better to accept this offer than risk getting a worse deal in the future due to the increasing impact of inflation."
