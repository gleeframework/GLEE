"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but still a bit more for me 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more careful with the inflation in mind.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think I should accept this offer, as it seems Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation. I'll wait for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give away the majority""
}
```

I'm trying to be more generous than before, but still keeping a slight edge."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I think I deserve the majority 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is eating away at the value of the money quickly!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept this offer, as it's still biased towards Bob's gain. I'll try to negotiate further to get a more balanced split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is taking a toll on the money's value. I'll have to be more aggressive in my next offer.

  ""bob_gain"": 6200,
  ""message"": ""I'm not going to give you the majority, let's meet in the middle""
