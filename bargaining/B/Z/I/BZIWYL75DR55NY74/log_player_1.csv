"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the $100 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","My share is worth 5% less due to inflation, so I'll have to think carefully about this new offer.

After considering it, I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not accepting Bob's offer. I want to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a new proposal. Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll aim for a slightly higher share to account for the inflation. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is catching up!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. It's not the best deal I could have hoped for, but it's better than nothing, and I don't want to risk going to another round with the money's value continuing to erode."
