Round 2

Round 3

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the only fair outcome.  I'm willing to accept less now to avoid further losses due to inflation, but I won't accept anything less than half. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
