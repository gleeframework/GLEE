"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, I'll give you a fair chance to counter""
}
```

This is a generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will see the value in accepting it and ending the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent share, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, I need to be cautious. However, Bob's offer is still a decent one, and I don't want to risk going into further rounds and losing more value due to inflation.

I'll decide to accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
