"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'll start with a proposal that is heavily in my favor, but I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would prefer a larger share, it's better to accept now before the inflation hits me harder in future rounds."
