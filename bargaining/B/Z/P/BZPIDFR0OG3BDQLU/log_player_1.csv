"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose that I take $6,000, and Bob gets $4,000.  This seems like a fair starting point given the inflation we need to consider.  I'm hoping this will be enough to secure my share quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
 
While I'd prefer more, it's better to accept this offer. I'm losing 10% of my potential earnings each round, and Bob is only losing 5%. If I reject this offer, I risk getting a worse deal later. It's in my best interest to take the 50% share now."
