I'm going for a very slight advantage here, knowing inflation will affect Bob more in future rounds. 
Let's see what Bob does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob is being extremely greedy, and I'm not going to let him get away with it.  I'll make my own counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm cutting my losses a bit here, but I'm still aiming for a significant majority of the money. I'm hoping Bob will realize that continuing to be so greedy will only hurt him in the long run."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still being ridiculously greedy!  I'm not going to give in to his unreasonable demands. I'll make my own offer in the next round, aiming for a fairer split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

This is a more reasonable offer,  giving Bob a larger share than before.  I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still aiming for a majority of the money."
