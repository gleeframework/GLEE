"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a proposal that gives me a significant portion of the money, but still leaves Bob with a decent amount.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's offer is a bit more generous than my initial offer, I'll consider it a good deal.
