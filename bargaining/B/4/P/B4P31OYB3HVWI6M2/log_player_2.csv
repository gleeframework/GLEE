Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage. While the offer is slightly better than her last one, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  We need to show her we're serious about getting a fair deal, even if it means risking a worse outcome in later rounds."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm not buying it. This is my counteroffer. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a tough spot. Alice is playing hardball, and we're running out of time.  Let's analyze:

* **The offer:** 440,000 is significantly less than we'd like, especially with the 26.49% inflation already eating into it.
* **Rounds left:**  We have 5 rounds left. If we reject, our bargaining power weakens each round due to inflation. Alice knows this and might keep lowballing us. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a better offer is risky. We might get even less later, or even nothing if we can't reach an agreement.

Given the circumstances and the dwindling value of the money, it's time to cut our losses and secure something. 

```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While it's not ideal, it's better to walk away with something than risk getting nothing at all."
