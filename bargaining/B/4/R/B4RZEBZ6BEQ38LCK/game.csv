6000.0,4000.0,"Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. I get $6,000 and you get $4,000. This way we both benefit from splitting the money early.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, your offer was heavily skewed in your favor. Let's be more realistic. I propose a 55/45 split, giving me a slight advantage in this round.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5800.0,4200.0,"Bob, your offer was tempting, but still favors you too much considering the inflation. I'm proposing $5,800 for me and $4,200 for you. This is a good deal considering the money will be worth even less if we wait longer.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4800.0,5200.0,"Alice, we're running out of time, and the money is losing value fast.  My last offer was already generous considering the inflation. I'm adjusting it slightly to 52/48, which is my final offer.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5600.0,4400.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous. We're both losing money with each round. I'm offering you $4,400 which is more than you would have gotten last round if you factor in the inflation. Take the deal, or we both lose! ",Alice,5,
