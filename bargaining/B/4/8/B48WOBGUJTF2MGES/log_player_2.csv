"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Let's see if we can negotiate a better deal."

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we need to settle this quickly.  This is a slight improvement on my previous offer, let's close the deal and avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer is still worse than my offer in the previous round, even considering inflation.  Let's see if we can reach a more agreeable outcome."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 525000,
""alice_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Alice, time is running out and we're both losing money. This offer is a compromise - let's end this now and both walk away with something substantial.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm willing to take a smaller gain to end this now. Let's be reasonable and avoid losing even more. 
# Bob gain: 490000 
# Alice gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

Alice is finally moving in the right direction, and the effects of inflation are becoming significant. Accepting this offer guarantees a reasonable payout, even with the losses due to inflation. Holding out further risks an even smaller gain."
