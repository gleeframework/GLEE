"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. This way we both get a decent amount.""}

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to meet in the middle. This way we both get a decent amount, and we can avoid going back and forth too much. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'll have to consider that in my decision.

I'm not thrilled about giving up $1,000 from my initial proposal, but Bob's offer is a decent compromise. I think I can live with it.
