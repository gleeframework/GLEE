"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 70,
""bob_gain"": 30,
""message"": ""Let's be fair, Bob. This offer leaves us both with a good amount.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fairer. This way we both get a good amount, and we can avoid the risk of losing money in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","This offer is tempting because it's more than I would get if I reject it and propose a 50/50 split in the next round. Let's analyze:

**If I reject:**

* **Next round:** The pot is worth $90 to me, $80 to Bob.  Even if I propose 50/50 and he accepts, I get $45.

**Conclusion:** Bob's offer of $40 is better than risking getting only $45 next round.
