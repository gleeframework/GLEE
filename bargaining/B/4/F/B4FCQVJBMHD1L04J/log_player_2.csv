Let's see how the inflation affects things and try to negotiate a better deal."

# Alice gain: 580000

Alice is right, the inflation is becoming more significant. However, I still believe a more equitable split is possible considering the faster rate at which my buying power diminishes. Let's see what she proposes in the next round."

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:

This offer is barely better than my last, and the inflation is increasingly eating into my potential gains. Accepting now is the best option to avoid getting even less in the following rounds."
