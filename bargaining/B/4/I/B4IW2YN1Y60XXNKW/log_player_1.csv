"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

This is a 50-50 split, which seems like a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, so I'll need to adjust my calculation accordingly.

Since the total amount is still $1,000,000, I'll consider the effective gain for me in this round to be 0.95 x 500000 = 475000.

Bob's offer is 400000, which is less than my effective gain in this round. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, my gain is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, and I'll try to make a more favorable offer for myself this time.

Since the total amount is still $1,000,000, I'll consider the effective gain for me in this round to be 0.95 x 500000 = 475000.

I'll make a slightly more aggressive offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This way, I'll get a slightly larger share, but still leave some room for Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is starting to bite! 

Let's calculate my effective gain for this round:

0.85 x 500000 = 425000

Bob's offer is 450000, which is more than my effective gain in this round. I'll accept this offer.
