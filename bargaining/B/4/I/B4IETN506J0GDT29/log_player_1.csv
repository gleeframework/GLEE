"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good deal for both of us.""}\n\nI'm offering $6,000 for myself and $4,000 for Bob. I believe this is a reasonable and fair split, and I'm hoping Bob will see it that way too. The message is intended to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept the offer. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60-40 is a fairer split for both of us.  Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not going to accept Bob's offer. Although the message claims a 60-40 split is fair, the actual numbers show that Bob is trying to give himself the larger share. Given that the money is worth the same to me as in the first round, but 20% less to Bob, I believe I can negotiate for a better deal in the next round. Let's proceed!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think 65-35 is a more reasonable split now. Let's settle this!""}\n\nIn this round, I've increased my share to $6,500 and decreased Bob's share to $3,500. Given that the money is worth 20% less to Bob than in the first round, but still worth the same to me, I believe this adjusted split reflects the changing value of the money. The message aims to justify the new split and encourage Bob to accept, emphasizing the impact of inflation on his share. Let's see how Bob responds!"
