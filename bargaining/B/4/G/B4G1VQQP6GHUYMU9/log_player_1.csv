"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is getting scarcer!

I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll have to adjust my calculation accordingly.

If I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $6,000, which is worth 80% of $8,000 (my initial target). That's not bad, but I was hoping to get more.

However, if I reject this offer and proceed to the next round, the money will be worth even less for me (40% of $8,000), but I might be able to negotiate a better deal.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With the money being worth 40% of its original value, I'll have to be more aggressive in my proposal.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $7,000 and Bob gets $3,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is getting even scarcer!

Let me calculate the value of the money in this round. Since the money is worth 48.8% of its original value for me, and 14.26% of its original value for Bob, I'll have to adjust my calculation accordingly.

If I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $5,500, which is worth 55% of $10,000 (my target). It's not a bad deal, but I'm still hoping to get more.

However, if I reject this offer and proceed to the next round, the money will be worth even less for me (24.4% of $10,000), and I might be able to negotiate a better deal.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With the money being worth 24.4% of its original value, I'll have to be even more aggressive in my proposal.

Here's my new offer:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
