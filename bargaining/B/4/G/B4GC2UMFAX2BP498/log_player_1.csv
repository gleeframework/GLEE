"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

This way, we both get $50, and we can call it a day!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly!

I'll think for a moment... Hmm, I'd rather not give Bob a bigger share, especially with the inflation. I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","With the inflation in mind, I'll make a new offer that gives me a slightly higher share. Here it is:

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}

This way, I'm trying to get a bit more value out of the deal before the money becomes even less valuable."
