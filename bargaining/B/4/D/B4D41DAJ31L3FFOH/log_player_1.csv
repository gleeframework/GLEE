"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm offering Bob 100,000$ and taking 900,000$ for myself.  I want to start with a generous offer, but still secure a large portion of the money.  Since I don't know how inflation is affecting Bob, I think this is a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer.  While I'm not sure how much the inflation is affecting Bob, I know mine is negligible. This offer is much worse than the first round for me, and I think I can do better.  I'm willing to take a risk and see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and taking 600,000$ for myself. I'm lowering my initial offer slightly, but I believe this is a fair compromise considering Bob rejected my previous offer. I'm still confident I can secure a larger portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer.  Even though Bob's gains are significantly affected by inflation, my gains are not. This offer is still worse than the first round for me, and I believe I can do better. I'm willing to take a risk and see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm offering Bob 300,000$ and taking 700,000$ for myself. I'm lowering my offer again, but I still believe I can secure a larger portion of the money.  I'm trying to find a balance between getting a good deal and avoiding further rejections."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I accept this offer. While it's not ideal, it's better than the previous offers I've received. I'm not sure how much longer I can afford to reject offers, as Bob's gains are being significantly impacted by inflation.  I'm willing to take this offer and secure a portion of the money before inflation erodes it further."
