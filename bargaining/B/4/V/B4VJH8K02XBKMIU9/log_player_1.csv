"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer. With inflation, my share of $300,000 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, so I'm getting $285,000 in ""real"" terms. Bob's share of $700,000 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round as well, so he's getting $665,000 in ""real"" terms.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, but I'll go with it for now.
