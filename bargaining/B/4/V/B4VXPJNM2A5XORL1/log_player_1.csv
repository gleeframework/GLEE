"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your generosity, but I think I can do better. Let's see if you're willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, my gain of $300,000 in the previous round is now worth $270,000. But with Bob's offer, I would be getting $300,000, which is still 10% more than what I offered initially. I think I can do better than that.

I reject Bob's offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me again, my gain of $270,000 from the previous round is now worth $243,000. I'll try to make a more attractive offer this time.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle. This is my best offer so far.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to move closer to your offer, but I still need to make sure I get a good share. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 27.1% less for me now, my gain of $420,000 from the previous round is now worth $304,220. Bob's offer of $400,000 is still a bit lower than my previous offer, but it's getting closer.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, but I don't want to risk going to the next round. I'll accept Bob's offer.
