"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. This way we both get a decent amount.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $600,000 and Bob gets $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","That's a big difference in the second round!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a pretty one-sided deal, Bob. I'm not willing to give you 7/10 of the money. I'll try to do better in the next round.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
