"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, 60-40""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $100, which is $40, and I'll take the remaining 60%, which is $60. My message is a friendly one, suggesting a fair split to start the game."
