"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I propose we split the money 55/45, with me getting the larger share.  I think this is a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer is reasonable, I'm going to try to get a slightly better deal.  I want to see if I can get closer to a 50/50 split before we start losing value due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split the money evenly.  This way, we both get the most we can before the value of the money starts to decrease.""}
