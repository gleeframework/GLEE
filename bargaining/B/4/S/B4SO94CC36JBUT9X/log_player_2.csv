I'm not sure about this split considering the inflation. I want to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my share is decreasing faster than yours if we delay. Let's settle on this! 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Even though the inflation hurts me more, I'm not sure I'll get a better offer next round.  It's getting riskier to wait."
