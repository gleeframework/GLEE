"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```

  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll give you a fair 40% of the pie. Accept and we can split the cash!""

# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, given the potential for inflation.  Let's get this done!

Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is already affecting the game!
