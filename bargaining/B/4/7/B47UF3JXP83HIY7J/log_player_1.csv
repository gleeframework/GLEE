"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

This is a straightforward offer, where we both get $5000 each. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can call it a day!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but still a decent amount 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's trying to take a bigger share, eh? Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 60/40 split. I'd like to make a counteroffer in Round 3!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's find a compromise""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, where I get a slightly larger share than Bob, but still a fair amount for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob's trying to take a big chunk of the pie! Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 30/70 split. That's not a fair deal for me. I'll make another counteroffer in Round 5!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""Getting closer to the middle, let's try to meet again""
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise that's closer to the middle ground, where I get a bit more than 40% and Bob gets a bit more than 58%."
