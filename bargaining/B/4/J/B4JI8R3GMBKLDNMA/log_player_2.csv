"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable and end this quickly. I take a bit more to account for the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your offer was tempting, but the time value of money is important. I'm proposing a slightly better split to reflect that. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to take advantage of the situation by framing her offers as generous due to the inflation she's experiencing. However, her offer is only slightly better for me than her last, and the overall trend is moving in her favor.  I need to hold firm to secure a better split."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 520000,
""alice_gain"": 480000,
""message"": ""Time is money for both of us, Alice.  I'm willing to concede a bit more to find a compromise, but this needs to be mutually beneficial.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm moving my offer closer to Alice's, signaling flexibility, but still holding onto a slightly advantageous position. The message emphasizes that we both lose out if this drags on, reminding Alice of the shrinking pie."

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most efficient solution.  We both lose if this drags on. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, a 50/50 split is a reasonable outcome at this stage. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:**  With only 7 rounds remaining, the pressure is mounting. Every round that passes significantly devalues the money for Alice, making a favorable agreement less likely. 
* **Fairness Argument:** Alice is now using the ""fairness"" argument of a 50/50 split, making it harder to justify holding out for a significantly better deal.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to push for a slightly larger share comes with the risk of Alice becoming increasingly frustrated and offering even less favorable terms later, or even reaching no agreement at all.  

A 50/50 split guarantees a decent payout, and at this point, it's a safer bet than gambling on securing a slightly larger share later in the game."
