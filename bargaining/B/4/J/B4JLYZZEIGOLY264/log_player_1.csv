"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}

I'm offering you 30 dollars, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping you'll accept and we can end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","In the second round, the money is worth 20% less, so I'll have to be more cautious.

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 2.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a higher share this time. Here's my offer for Round 3:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}

I'm offering you 45 dollars, hoping you'll accept and we can move forward!"
