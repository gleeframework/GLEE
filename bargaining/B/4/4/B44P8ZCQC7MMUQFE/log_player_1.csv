# Bob's message: I understand you want a larger share, but this split is more equitable. Let's close this deal quickly.

Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is a fair offer considering the time pressure and the impact on your potential gains. Let's settle this now. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is being incredibly stubborn and trying to take advantage of the inflation working against me.  While my potential gains are decreasing, I need to hold firm to get a deal that's at least somewhat reasonable. Accepting now would be letting him win.  I'm hoping he'll start to panic in the later rounds."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm holding firm. This offer is fair and accounts for the time pressure. Let's be reasonable and close the deal. 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The pressure is definitely on, but Bob is clearly trying to exploit the situation. I need to hold my ground a little longer.  He's got to crack soon and realize that getting a slightly smaller share is better than nothing."
