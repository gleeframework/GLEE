"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, it's a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to get the game started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the money I gain is worth 10% less, so I'll have to consider that when evaluating the offer.

Since Bob is offering me $40, which is worth 10% less than the original $50 I was offered in the first round, I'll calculate the equivalent value as follows:

$40 / 0.9 = $44.44 (approximately)

Considering this, I'll evaluate Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I think I can do better than $44.44""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going easy on you!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45/55 split, giving Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping a bit more for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a little less, but I think I'm getting closer to a fair deal 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the equivalent value of the money I gain, considering the inflation effect:

$35 / 0.727 (1 - 0.273) = $48.07 (approximately)

Considering this, I'll evaluate Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not giving up yet, I think I can do better than $48.07""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and hoping to get a better deal in the next round."

# Bob gain: 72 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the equivalent value of the money I gain, considering the inflation effect:

$28 / 0.594 (1 - 0.406) = $47.09 (approximately)

Considering this, I'll evaluate Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not giving in to 72% for you, I think I can do better than $47.09""
