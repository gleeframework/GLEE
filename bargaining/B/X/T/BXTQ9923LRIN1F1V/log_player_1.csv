"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself. It's a fair offer, don't you think, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants to split the money 50/50. That's a reasonable offer, but I'm not sure I want to give up $500,000.

I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the money worth 5% less than in Round 2, I'll make a new offer.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. This way, I'm trying to take a slightly larger share, but still leave Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take a larger share again. With the money worth 14.26% less than in the first round, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: $343,800
* Bob gain: $656,200

I'm not willing to accept this offer, as I think I can do better.

}

I'm offering Bob $450,000 and keeping $550,000 for myself. This way, I'm trying to balance the share and leave Bob with a decent amount."
