"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, it's equivalent to $80 in the original amount. I'll propose a 50-50 split, but since the money is worth less for me, I'll actually get $40 and Alice will get $60.
