"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the $10000 with a 75/25 split in favor of Alice, given the potential risk of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While a 25% share is something, it's worth considering the potential for higher gains if I reject and make a counteroffer. The inflation risk is a factor, but I'm willing to gamble on a better deal."
