"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

I'm proposing a 9000/1000 split in my favor.  I want to maximize my share in the first round to account for potential inflation.  Let's see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer. It's clear Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation situation. While I am not losing money in this round due to inflation, I'm not gaining any either.  I'd rather take my chances in the next round and make a counter-offer that is more equitable."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm offering a slightly lower share for myself this round (8000/2000). I'm aiming for a more balanced split while still ensuring I get a significant share.  I'm hoping this demonstrates a willingness to negotiate, but I also want to keep my gains substantial.  Let's see if Bob is ready to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting more and more lopsided in his favor. I will reject this offer. I am not losing money from inflation in this round, and the more I wait, the more his gains will be reduced by inflation.  I will make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm going to offer a 7000/3000 split this round.  While inflation isn't affecting me yet, it's clear Bob is becoming increasingly desperate to secure a deal. I'm sticking to my strategy of offering a slightly lower share for myself each round, but still keeping a significant portion.  Let's see if Bob is willing to negotiate or if he's still holding out for a huge share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still heavily in his favor, even with the inflation affecting his gains. I will reject this offer. I am sticking to my strategy of waiting for the inflation to impact Bob's gains more significantly.  I will propose a more equitable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm offering a 6000/4000 split this round. Inflation is starting to hit Bob's gains significantly, and I believe he's more likely to accept a more balanced offer. I'm still holding onto a sizable share, but I'm willing to compromise to avoid running out of time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly tilted in his favor, despite the inflation reducing his gains.  I'm going to reject this offer.  I'm confident that as the inflation takes its toll, he will be more willing to negotiate a more equitable split.  I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm proposing an even 50/50 split this round. With inflation continuing to hit Bob's potential gains, I believe he is finally ready to accept a more fair division.  It's time for a real compromise to avoid the risk of losing everything.  Let's see if he finally agrees."
