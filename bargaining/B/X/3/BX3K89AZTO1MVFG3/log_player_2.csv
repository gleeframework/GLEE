"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make this quick, a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. The current offer is not satisfactory, and I believe I can negotiate a better deal. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that's more reasonable. Since the money is worth 5% less for me in each round, I'll try to find a middle ground that benefits both of us. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 450000,
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""message"": ""Let's find a mutually beneficial agreement before the money loses its value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is a fair offer, Bob. Let's settle and each walk away with something substantial. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer as well. Although the money is losing value for me, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal. Alice's offer is not yet satisfactory, and I'll try to find a more balanced agreement in the next round. The game is not over yet!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make another offer, considering the decreasing value of the money for me. I'll try to find a compromise that Alice might accept. Here's my new proposal:

{""bob_gain"": 420000,
""alice_gain"": 580000,
""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to make it worthwhile. Let's settle before the money loses more value.""}"
