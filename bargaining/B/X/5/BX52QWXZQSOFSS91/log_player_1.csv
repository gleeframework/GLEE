Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: That's a tough start, Alice! How about I flip it around? You take 35% while it's still worth a good amount, and we can avoid this whole inflation mess. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
