"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $100, which is $40, and keeping 60% for myself, which is $60."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a more fair split, considering the inflation will hit me harder. Let's agree and move on. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, the money is worth less, and Bob's offer seems more appealing. However, I'm still not willing to accept a split that's not as favorable to me as possible.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation rate, the money is worth even less, and I need to make a more aggressive offer to compensate. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob. We can still make this work!""
}
```

I'm offering a 50-50 split, but I'm still hoping Bob will accept this offer."
