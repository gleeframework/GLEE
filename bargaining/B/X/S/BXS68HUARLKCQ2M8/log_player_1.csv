"Round 1

{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I propose taking $900,000 and giving Bob $100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point, given that we have 12 rounds to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I am proposing a 60/40 split in my favor, recognizing that the money is losing value with each round. This should be attractive to Bob, as he will still receive a significant share."

# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting this offer. While the inflation is hitting hard, I'm still confident I can get a better deal. I'm going to try to negotiate a more even split in the next round."

Round 5

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split. The inflation is serious now, so it's time to compromise and find a deal that benefits us both."

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

While I'm feeling the pressure from the inflation, I believe I can still get a more equitable deal. I'm rejecting this offer and will propose something fairer in the next round."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000}
```

I'm proposing a 45/55 split in Bob's favor. With each passing round, the inflation is making it increasingly difficult to get a good deal. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the current situation."

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting this offer. While the inflation is severely diminishing the value of the money, it's better to take something than risk getting nothing. I've tried to negotiate a better deal, but it seems Bob is determined to get a larger share."
