"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept this and we can move on!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial amount, and keeping 60% for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for Bob, he's effectively offering me a smaller amount than in the previous round, but still a larger share.

I'll reject this offer because it's not a significant improvement from my previous offer, and I'm not willing to give up more than 40% of the total amount.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation. This is my best offer so far!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share, but still a fair amount considering the inflation."
