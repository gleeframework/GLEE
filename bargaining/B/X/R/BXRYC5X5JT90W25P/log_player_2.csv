Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 750000, ""alice_gain"": 250000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Alice. This is a much fairer split.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. Time is working against you with the inflation.  This is still a good deal for you while ensuring I don't walk away empty-handed. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, the clock is ticking and your potential gains are shrinking.  This is a compromise - a strong offer for me, but one that still leaves you with a decent amount. Let's settle this now. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage. While the offer is better than nothing, accepting now sets a bad precedent. I need to show Alice I'm willing to risk it for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer. It's a fair split considering the time pressure and inflation. Take it or leave it.""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  We're past the halfway point, and time is my biggest enemy.  I need to push for a resolution soon.
* **Firmness:**  Bluffing with a ""final offer"" might make Alice take my proposal more seriously, especially since it's still relatively fair. 
* **Inflation:**  Even with this offer, I'm losing a significant chunk to inflation, but it's better than risking getting a much smaller amount (or nothing) in later rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. You're losing so much value with each passing round. Take this deal and we both win! Don't be greedy. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Inflation:** The inflation is eating significantly into my potential gains. Waiting any longer is very risky.
* **Downward Trend:** Alice's offers have been getting worse, not better. This suggests she might be willing to take even more in later rounds. 
* **Something is Better Than Nothing:** While not ideal, 300,000 is still a substantial amount of money. Risking everything for a slightly better deal at this point is not worth it."
