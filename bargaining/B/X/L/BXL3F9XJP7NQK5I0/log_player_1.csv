I'm starting with a high offer for myself, but I'm still giving Bob a small amount to incentivize him to accept.  We'll see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being greedy, offering me a significantly lower amount than what I proposed.  I'll counter with a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm raising my offer slightly, but still giving Bob a fair share. I hope he realizes it's better to agree now than risk getting nothing later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, even with the reduced value of my money. I'm going to keep trying to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm taking a slight risk here, but I think offering Bob a slightly higher amount will be more appealing than waiting another round and risking getting even less. We're getting closer to the end of the game, so it's time to get serious about a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though the value of my money is significantly reduced, I'm taking the offer.  It's a 50/50 split, which is fair, and we're running out of rounds.  It's better to get something than risk getting nothing at all."
