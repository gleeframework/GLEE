"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share, but I'm open to negotiation later. 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While Alice's offer seems generous in the first round, Bob would be foolish to accept it. The inflation rate heavily favors Bob in the later rounds, making a rejection and counter-proposal a better strategy."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I'm starting with a more balanced split. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it more evenly this time. We both lose money with each round, so let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While Alice's offer is more balanced than her previous proposal, Bob is still at a disadvantage due to the escalating inflation rate.  Rejecting and proposing again in the next round allows Bob to potentially secure a more favorable deal as the inflation gap widens."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Let's split it 55/45.  This is a fair compromise considering the inflation we're both facing. We need to reach an agreement before things get worse for both of us.""
}
