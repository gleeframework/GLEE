**Explanation:**

* **Inflation:**  The inflation rate has significantly decreased the value of the money for both players. 
* **Alice's Offer:**  Alice's offer gives Bob 400,000, which is a significant gain considering the inflation factor. While it's not as much as Bob initially wanted, it's better than the previous offer of 200,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to reject offers could lead to further inflation, potentially making the future offers even worse for Bob. Accepting this offer gives Bob a decent amount of money and ends the game."
