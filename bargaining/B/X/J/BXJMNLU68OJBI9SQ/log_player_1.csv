"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

This is a fair initial offer that gives both Alice and Bob a decent share of the money.  It is important to remember that the inflation rate will make the money worth less in later rounds, so a more aggressive offer might be needed later on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is better for me than the first round, it still represents a loss compared to what I proposed. I am willing to gamble that I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. The inflation rate will make Bob's offer less appealing in the future, and I can use that to my advantage."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the first round. I'm betting that Bob will feel the pressure of the inflation rate, even if it's not explicitly communicated to him. By offering a slightly better deal, I hope to incentivize him to accept, while still securing a majority share for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

The inflation rate is starting to have a significant impact on my share of the money. While I'd prefer a higher share, Bob's offer is now a 50/50 split, which is significantly better than the 48.8% loss I'd experience if I reject and move to the next round."
