4500.0,5500.0,"I think a 55/45 split is fairer, considering the inflation affects me more. Let's see if we can agree on this!",Bob,2,

8000.0,2000.0,"I'm willing to compromise.  Let's split it 80/20, with me taking the bigger share since I'm not affected by inflation like you are.  Let's get this settled!",Alice,3,

4000.0,6000.0,"I'm willing to go up to 6000 for me, but I need a bigger share to make up for the inflation. Let's try to reach an agreement before the money loses even more value.",Bob,4,

7000.0,3000.0,"I'm still feeling generous, but I need to get a bigger share to make it worthwhile for me. Let's try 70/30 this time. It's better than the previous rounds, and with each passing round, the money gets less valuable for you.  Let's work together!",Alice,5,

3500.0,6500.0,"I understand your desire for a bigger share, but I'm still feeling the impact of inflation. Let's try 65/35 this time. We need to settle this quickly, or both of us will lose out in the end.",Bob,6,

6000.0,4000.0,"Let's make a final compromise. I'll take 60% and you take 40%.  The inflation is affecting you greatly now, and it's only going to get worse. We need to close this deal before we both lose out completely.",Alice,7,
