I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where I would receive $5,000 and Bob would receive $5,000."

# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""You're getting closer, but I'm still not willing to give up too much. Let's meet in the middle!""}

I'm proposing a slightly more generous offer, giving Bob a slightly larger share of the total amount. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob than my previous offer."

Round 4

# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob's offer is getting more aggressive!

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting this offer because it's too lopsided. I'm not willing to give up 30% of the total amount to Bob, especially considering the inflation is affecting my gains more severely. I think I can still negotiate a better deal."

{""alice_gain"": 4200, ""bob_gain"": 5800, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but don't expect me to give up too much more. This is my final offer!""}

I'm trying to find a sweet spot where I'm not giving up too much, but still showing some willingness to compromise. This offer is slightly more generous than my previous one, but I'm not going to give in to Bob's aggressive demands."
