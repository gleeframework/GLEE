"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take 60 and you take 40""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a relatively fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 51/49 split is more fair.  Let's be reasonable and get this done! 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 51/49 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Since Bob is trying to be reasonable, I'll accept this offer for now.
