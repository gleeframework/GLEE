Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very generous offer for Bob.  I figure a tiny amount is better than nothing, and it sets a precedent for further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, it's better to take 500,000 now than risk getting nothing in the remaining rounds. The inflation is a significant factor, and I don't know how it will affect Bob's proposals in future rounds."
