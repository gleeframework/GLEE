"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and be done with it!""
}
```

This way, we both get $500,000 and can call it a day."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit less, but still a good deal 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my $500,000 is now worth $475,000.

Considering Bob's offer, I'd rather have $400,000 now, which is still a decent amount, than risk going to the next round and potentially getting even less.

I accept the offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
