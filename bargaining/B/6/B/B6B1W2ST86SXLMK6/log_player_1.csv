"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'll start with a fair offer, giving Bob 10% and keeping 90% for myself. It's important to establish a baseline and see how Bob reacts to it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is worse than my initial offer.  Even though the money he's offering me is worth the same as in round 1, I'm getting a much smaller share. I'll reject and see if he'll make a more reasonable offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'll raise my offer slightly. Since Bob is losing value on his side more quickly, I'll increase my share to 80% and give him 20%.  This will hopefully be attractive enough for him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse with each round.  He's offering less and less, while my side is staying the same. Even though it's only 40% of the initial value, it's the best offer I've seen so far.  I'll accept it and take what I can get."
