"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, it's fair and simple!""
}
```

This way, we both get an equal share of the money, and we can both be happy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the high road, but you'll get a smaller share this time! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation reducing the value of Bob's gain, I'll have to be cautious. Since I'm getting a smaller share this time, I'll reject the offer. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 70% to him and 30% to me, I'll try to get a better deal this time. I'll offer a bit more to Bob, but still keep a significant share for myself.

```

  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I still want a decent chunk for myself!""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation reducing the value of Bob's gain even further, I'll try to take advantage of it. Since I'm getting 40% of the remaining money, I'll accept this offer.
