"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 
I propose a 99/1 split in my favor. This is a very aggressive offer, but I believe it will incentivize Bob to accept. Since the money is worth less with each round, I want to maximize my share quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would have preferred a larger share, I am willing to accept this offer. The inflation rate is unknown to me, so there is a risk that Bob will reject any future offers I might make. This 50/50 split is a fair and reasonable outcome given the circumstances."
