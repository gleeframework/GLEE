**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is decreasing rapidly. Waiting longer significantly erodes the potential gains for both players.
* **Bob's Position:** Bob is likely to be increasingly motivated to secure a deal as his share is losing value faster.  He may not be willing to offer more favorable terms in the future.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a slightly larger share is a risky gamble. There's no guarantee Bob will offer a better deal, and the value of the money will continue to decline."
