"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I take the lion's share this time, but I'm open to negotiating in future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While it's tempting to accept a small amount now, it's better to see if Alice is willing to negotiate. Rejecting the offer allows you to become the proposer in the next round and potentially get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Let's split it evenly this time. We can work out a more balanced deal later if you'd like.""
