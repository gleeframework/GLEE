Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:** While my money is worth 20% less, Bob's money is only worth 5% less. This means my relative bargaining power has decreased significantly. 
* **Fair Offer:** Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, which is fair considering the inflation factor. 
* **Risk of Rejection:**  If I reject, I have no guarantee of a better offer in the next round.  The inflation will continue to erode my share, and Bob might become even more reluctant to share. 

It's better to accept the 50/50 split and secure a decent amount of money."
