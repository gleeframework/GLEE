"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me $600,000 and Bob $400,000. The message is a friendly opening offer, hoping to set a positive tone for the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being greedy, I'll give you a decent chance to get a better deal! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I need to reassess the offer.

My current proposal was rejected, and now Bob is offering a 75-25 split, giving me $300,000 and Bob $700,000. Considering the reduced value of money, I'm not as eager to accept this offer.

I'll reject this offer and hope to get a better deal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 5% less due to inflation, my offer is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, a fair compromise!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42-58 split, giving me $420,000 and Bob $580,000, trying to find a middle ground after Bob's previous offer."
