I'm going for a big chunk of the money in the first round.  Since I don't know how inflation affects Bob, I'm assuming he's also feeling the pressure, so I'll make a fairly aggressive offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a bigger chunk, the inflation is hurting me and I don't know how many more rounds I can afford to lose 20%. Accepting this offer guarantees me at least some money, and it's a significant improvement over the first round."
