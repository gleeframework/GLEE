"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose taking 90 dollars for myself and giving 10 dollars to Bob. This ensures a quick resolution, but it's important to note that this is a very aggressive opening move.  I'm aware of the inflation, but I need to secure a substantial portion early on. Let's see what Bob decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer to have a larger share, I have to consider the inflation.  Accepting this offer means I get a decent amount, even with the 10% reduction.  Taking the risk of rejecting and potentially getting nothing in the end is too high.  Let's go with Bob's offer."
