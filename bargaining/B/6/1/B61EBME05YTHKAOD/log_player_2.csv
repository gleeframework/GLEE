Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, I'll budge a little. 58 for me, 42 for you. Let's close this deal, the clock is ticking! 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is using the shrinking pot and time pressure against me. However, her concessions are still too small. It's worth risking another round to try and secure a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""The inflation is working against me, but I need a bigger share to make this worthwhile.  This is my final offer.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** With only 6 rounds left, time pressure is mounting. It's crucial to secure a deal soon.
* **Shifting Power Dynamics:** By offering Alice slightly less than her initial offer, Bob is subtly turning the tables and demonstrating that he's not desperate, despite the inflation disadvantage. 
* **Finality:**  By stating this is his ""final offer,"" Bob introduces a sense of urgency and forces Alice to make a decision â€“ accept a slightly less favorable deal or risk losing it all."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Alright, Bob, let's meet in the middle. 55 for me, 45 for you. Time is running out, and this is a decent deal! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Crunch:**  With only 5 rounds left, the time pressure is immense. The risk of getting nothing is becoming very real.
* **Diminishing Returns:** The longer the game goes on, the less Bob's potential gain becomes due to inflation. 
* **Reasonable Compromise:** While not ideal, Alice's offer is a reasonable compromise. Accepting now guarantees Bob a decent share of the money, whereas holding out for a slightly better deal carries a significant risk of ending up with nothing."
