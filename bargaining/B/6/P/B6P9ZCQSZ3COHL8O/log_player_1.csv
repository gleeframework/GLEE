"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can move on!""
}
```

This way, I'll get 90% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob will get 10%. The message is a friendly one, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to find a better split, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 10% less, so I'll get 30% of the current amount, which is $300,000, and Bob will get 70% of the current amount, which is $700,000.

I'll reject this offer because it's not favorable to me. I'd like to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, so I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle. Accept and we can move on!""
}
```

This way, I'll get 55% of the current amount, and Bob will get 45%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to find a fair split, Alice. This is a reasonable compromise. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, so I'll get 50% of the current amount, which is $500,000, and Bob will also get 50% of the current amount, which is $500,000.

This offer is actually a 50/50 split, which is a fair compromise. I'll accept this offer.
