"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. This is a relatively equal split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to get closer to a fair split, but I'm not giving up too much yet 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my $8,000 from the first round is now worth $7,200 (since it's 10% less). I'll consider Bob's new offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to give up that much, let's try to get closer to a fairer split for me""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm not willing to give up $2,000 when I could potentially get more. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my $7,200 from the previous round is now worth $6,480 (another 10% decrease). Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7200,
  ""bob_gain"": 2800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while""
}
```

I'm proposing a slightly more favorable split for myself, but still trying to be reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think we can do better than this. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can get closer to a fair split 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my $6,480 from the previous round is now worth $4,712 (27.1% less). I'll consider Bob's new offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""I think we've finally found a fair split, let's call it a day""
}
```
