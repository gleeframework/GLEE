I propose to take 6000$ and give Bob 4000$.  This seems like a fair starting point, as it gives me a slight advantage but leaves plenty for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share,  taking 5800 is still a good deal. The inflation is starting to bite, and I'm not sure if I can get a better deal in the next round."
