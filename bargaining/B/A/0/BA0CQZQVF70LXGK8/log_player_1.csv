"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 90% of the $1,000,000, and Bob gets 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be careful with this offer. Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, but the money Bob gains is worth 20% less, I should be wary of Bob's offer.

I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob's offer was 80% of the remaining amount, I'll try to counter with a slightly higher percentage. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the $1,000,000, and Bob gets 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, but the money Bob gains is worth significantly less, I'll have to be cautious.

However, considering the rapid decrease in value of the money Bob gains, I'll take a chance and accept this offer.
