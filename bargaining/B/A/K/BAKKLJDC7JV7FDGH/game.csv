60.0,40.0,"Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. I get $60, you get $40.  The value decreases each round, so it's in our best interest to settle this quickly.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"I think we can do better than that. I'm willing to accept a slightly less even split, but I need more than $40. Let's try $55 for me and $45 for you.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"Bob, this is getting us nowhere fast. My turn, same deal as before - I get $55, you get $45.  Let's be realistic, the clock is ticking!",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
40.0,60.0,"Alice, we're both losing money with every round.  Let's compromise and split it 60/40.  This gives me a bit more, but still ensures we both get a good deal.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
50.0,50.0,"Bob, this is ridiculous. Let's just split it down the middle - 50/50.  It's the fairest option and we're running out of time! Take it or leave it.",Alice,5,
