I'm not going to accept an offer where Alice gets 9 times more than me! I'm going to try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm proposing a 50/50 split. It's a fair offer, and I think it's in both our best interests to avoid further rounds and the potential for losing money due to inflation."
