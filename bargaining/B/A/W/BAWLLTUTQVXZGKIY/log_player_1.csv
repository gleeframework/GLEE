Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 38, ""bob_gain"": 62} 
```

With only two rounds left, and the value of my share continuing to plummet, I have to be realistic. I'm offering a slightly higher share to Bob in hopes of getting a deal done. It's still a significantly lower share than I would like, but it's better than getting nothing at all in the next round."

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a very tough decision, as I'm getting a very small share of the money due to the inflation.  However, there is no more room for negotiation, and if I reject this offer, I will get nothing. It's better to get something than nothing."
