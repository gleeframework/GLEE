"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5} 
```

I'm going to offer Bob a small share (5$) to ensure I get the majority of the money. Since the value of money decreases with each round, it's better to secure a larger share early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While it's not ideal, I should accept this offer. The inflation rate is higher for Bob, meaning the value of his gain is diminishing more rapidly. It's likely that if I reject this offer, he'll be able to offer me even less in the next round."
