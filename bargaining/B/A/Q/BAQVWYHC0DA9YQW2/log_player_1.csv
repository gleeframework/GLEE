"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

I'm going to start with a pretty generous offer to Bob. This might encourage him to accept in the first round and avoid any potential for inflation to hurt us both.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much worse than my initial offer, even accounting for the inflation. I'm willing to take the risk of going to the next round and trying to get a better deal. I believe I can negotiate a better outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob 3000, which is less than my initial offer, but still a decent amount. I'm hoping that the inflation will encourage Bob to accept this time, as he might be concerned about getting less in the future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still worse than my previous offer, even accounting for the inflation.  I am still confident that I can negotiate a better outcome.  I'm going to keep trying to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob 4000. This is a compromise, but it's important to remember that the value of my share keeps decreasing with inflation. I need to secure a deal soon before the inflation further diminishes my potential gains."
