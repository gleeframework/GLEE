"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

I'm going for a pretty aggressive split in the first round. I want to see if Bob is willing to accept a smaller share right away, or if he wants to play it safe and wait for his turn to propose."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject Bob's offer. While it's better than nothing, I'm not willing to settle for such a small share, especially since I know the money will continue to lose value. I'll take my chances and propose a more equitable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  Since the money is worth less with each round, I need to secure a larger share to compensate for the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting this offer. Even though the inflation is taking a bigger bite out of the money, I'm still hoping to get a more balanced split. It seems like Bob is being stubborn, so I'll continue to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split this round. The inflation is getting serious, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with an even worse deal later on.  It's time to try and find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'm not thrilled with the 4500/5500 split, the inflation is really starting to hurt now. I've lost almost half the value of my potential earnings.  It's time to be practical and secure a reasonable share before the money is worth even less."
