"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly, considering the inflation""}\n\n###\nI am offering a 60-40 split, with me receiving $600,000 and Bob receiving $400,000. I believe this is a fair offer, taking into account the fact that the money is worth less with each passing round due to inflation. I hope Bob will accept this offer and we can conclude the game.\n###\n###\nYour turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair considering the inflation difference, but I'm open to negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI will not accept Bob's offer of a 40-60 split. Given that the money I gain is worth only 5% less than in the first round, but the money Bob gains is worth 20% less, I believe his offer does not adequately take into account the impact of inflation on his share. I will make a counteroffer in the next round.\n###\n###\nYour turn!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation difference, I'm willing to meet in the middle""}\n\n###\nIn this round, I am offering a 55-45 split, with me receiving $550,000 and Bob receiving $450,000. Given the significant difference in how inflation affects our shares, I believe this offer is more than fair. The money I gain is now worth 10% less than its original value, while the money Bob gains is worth 36% less. I'm trying to find a middle ground that takes into account the decreasing value of the money for both of us, but especially for Bob.\n###\n###\nYour turn!"
