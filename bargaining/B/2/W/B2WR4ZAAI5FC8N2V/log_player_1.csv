"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This is a fairly aggressive first offer, but it leaves some room for negotiation. I'm aiming to get as much of the money as possible, while still leaving Bob with a somewhat reasonable offer. I'm hoping he'll accept to avoid the risk of inflation impacting his potential gains in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is significantly better than the previous round, it's still not a good deal for me. The inflation hit me hard, but his offer doesn't reflect that. I'm hoping I can get a better deal in the next round when I get to propose."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to try a more balanced approach this time. Bob's offer in the previous round showed he's willing to negotiate. I'm offering him a larger share, but I still aim to get a significant portion of the money. I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing and avoids further inflation."
