Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm starting with a pretty aggressive offer, Alice. I figure I'll take most of the money, but I'm still leaving Bob with a small amount. Hopefully, he'll accept and we can both walk away with something.  Let's see if he's feeling generous!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

This is a fair deal, and I don't want to risk losing more money due to inflation.  Let's call it a day."
