Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Bob, I'm losing a lot due to inflation. I need to make it worth my while. This is my final offer.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency:**  We need to signal to Bob that time is running out. The ""final offer"" message adds pressure.
* **Shift in Balance:** Bob is getting increasingly aggressive. Offering slightly more than his last offer (5800) but significantly less than our round 3 offer (5500) might make him reconsider.
* **Inflation Factor:**  While 5200 seems low compared to earlier rounds, the rapid inflation means it might be the best we can get. If we reject this and Bob continues his trend, we risk getting even less in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're running out of time, I'm taking the bigger share 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Critical Point:**  The inflation has eaten away a significant chunk of the potential gains. Accepting 4000 is better than risking getting even less in further rounds.
* **Bob's Strategy:** Bob is clearly aware of our predicament and is exploiting the inflation to his advantage. He's unlikely to offer anything better at this point. 
* **Limited Options:**  We're running out of rounds.  Rejecting this offer means gambling on Bob being significantly more generous in the next round, which is unlikely given his current trajectory."
