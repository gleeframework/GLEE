"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, then we can negotiate further""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more this round, but I'm willing to negotiate further. Let's see how this goes. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 400,000
* Bob gain: 600,000

I'm not thrilled about taking less than I proposed initially, but I'm willing to negotiate further. I'll accept Bob's offer for now.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
