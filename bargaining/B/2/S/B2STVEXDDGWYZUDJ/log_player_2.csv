"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your point about the inflation rate, but a 60/40 split is still too unequal for me.  I propose 55/45, which is a more balanced compromise. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
