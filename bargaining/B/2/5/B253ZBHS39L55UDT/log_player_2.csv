"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 60%, you take 40%. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Your turn, Alice. I'm feeling a bit more generous than your previous offer.  Let's make a deal.""}
```
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Time Value of Money:** Delaying an agreement hurts Bob more than Alice due to the higher inflation rate he faces. It's in his best interest to secure a reasonable deal quickly.
* **Slight Advantage:** Offering Alice slightly less than what she offered Bob still gives her a decent share while giving Bob a slight advantage. 
* **Urgency and Encouragement:** The message aims to convey a sense of urgency to Alice while also framing the offer in a positive light."
