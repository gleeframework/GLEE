"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60-40 in my favor.""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and give Bob $4,000. My message to Bob is that I think this split is fair, with me getting 60% of the money and him getting 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth less due to inflation, my gain of $2,500 is now worth $2,250 (10% less than the original $2,500) and Bob's gain of $7,500 is now worth $7,063.75 (5% less than the original $7,500).

I'm not sure if this is a good deal, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
