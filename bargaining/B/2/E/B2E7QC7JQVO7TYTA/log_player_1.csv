"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not willing to give away too much 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure if I want to accept an offer that gives me 40% of the remaining money. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is eating away at the money, so I'd better make a strong offer!

```

  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better deal than last time""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45/55 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than Bob's previous offer. Let's see if he'll accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still not willing to give away too much 
# Alice gain: 3800 
# Bob gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is eating away at my potential gains! I need to think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that this offer is good enough, especially considering the money is worth less and less with each passing round. I'd like to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value. I'd better make a strong offer to try to get a good deal.

  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a better deal than last time""
}
```

# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is dropping rapidly! I need to think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
