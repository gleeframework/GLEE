"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose you take $900,000 and Bob takes $100,000.  I figure it's a fair starting point, and it gives Bob a chance to see if he wants to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer is the best strategy. My gains are worth 20% less than the first round, and there's a chance Bob will keep rejecting offers, leading to further losses. It's better to secure a decent portion now rather than risk getting nothing."
