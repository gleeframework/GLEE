This offer gives me a large portion of the money, but still leaves Bob with something. I'm hoping that it's enticing enough for him to accept in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob is being greedy!  I'm going to reject this offer.  While I'd get something, it's a much smaller share than I initially offered, and the inflation means I'm losing value with every round.  I'll be able to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}

I'm going to lower my offer slightly, but still keep a large portion of the money.  Since I rejected his offer, I hope this shows him I'm serious about getting a fair share. Inflation is hurting me, so I need to make sure I get a good deal."
