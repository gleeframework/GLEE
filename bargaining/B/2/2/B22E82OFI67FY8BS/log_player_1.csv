Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, 60-40 is reasonable.""}\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split, which I think is a fair starting point. The message is a brief explanation of why I chose this split.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know what Bob decides!"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit too much in your favor. I'm proposing a more balanced 55-45 split. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not ready to accept a 55-45 split. I think I can get a better deal, so I'll reject Bob's offer and make a new proposal in the next round.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know the outcome!"

How about 58-42?""}\n\nI've taken Bob's offer into consideration, but I still believe I should get a larger share. I'm proposing a 58-42 split as a compromise.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know what Bob decides!"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out Alice, and the value is decreasing with each round. I'm proposing a 52-48 split. Let's close the deal. 
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant decrease in value due to inflation, I think accepting the 52-48 split is the best option at this point. Prolonging the game further would lead to even greater losses, so I'll accept Bob's offer to minimize the impact of inflation.\n\n###\n\nPlease conclude the game!"
