"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you a small portion""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted to give me a small portion, I'll give you a smaller portion this time, but still fair 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, my gain of $4,000 is actually worth $3,200 in real terms.

I accept the offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
