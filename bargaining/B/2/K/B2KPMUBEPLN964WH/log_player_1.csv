"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than that. If we both take a little less, we can secure a good amount now, before the money loses more value.  Let's split it 55/45, with me getting 55.  What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
