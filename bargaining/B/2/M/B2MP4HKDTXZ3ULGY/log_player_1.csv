"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}

This is a classic game theory scenario, and in the first round, I'm taking a greedy approach! I want to maximize my share, knowing that if I don't get a good deal now, Bob's share will be worth significantly less in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to keep a larger share, it's in my best interest to accept this offer. If I reject it, Bob's offer will be worth less in the next round, and I risk getting even less than half the money. It's better to take the guaranteed 500,000 now."
