70.0,30.0,Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this split is fair considering the time pressure and the fact that the value decreases for me each round.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
40.0,60.0,"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I believe this split is more equitable given the time constraints and the changing value of the money. I propose we each take a larger share in this round, with 60% going to me and 40% going to you.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
65.0,35.0,"Bob, I understand you want a larger share, but your offer doesn't reflect the decreasing value of the money for me. I'm proposing a compromise that's closer to my initial offer.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
30.0,70.0,"Alice, we need to move faster. The money is losing value for both of us. I'm willing to increase my share to 70%, but I believe this is the final offer I can make before the value becomes too low for us both. Let's split the remaining value and move on.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
55.0,45.0,"Bob, you're right about the need to move quickly, but your offer is still heavily skewed in your favor. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. This is a fair compromise considering the time pressure.",Alice,5,
