"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80/20, a fair starting point?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping to negotiate a better deal in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I should get a bit more 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to accept a smaller share this round due to inflation. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the 6000 dollars, it's better than nothing, and I'll try to negotiate a better deal in future rounds."
