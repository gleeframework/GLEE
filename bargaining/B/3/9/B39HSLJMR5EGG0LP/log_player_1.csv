"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need for negotiations!""
}
```

I'm proposing a fair and equal split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but still a good chunk for myself 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll have to be more careful with my decisions.

After considering Bob's offer, I'll reject it. I'd rather not give up 20% of the remaining value of the money. I'll wait for a better offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth even less due to inflation, I'll have to be more aggressive in my proposal. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not getting taken advantage of!""
}
```

I'm trying to balance my desire to get a decent share with the risk of inflation eating into our earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm still not giving away too much 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is taking a toll on the value of our earnings!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll reject it. I'd rather not give up 16% of the remaining value of the money. I'll wait for a better offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With inflation eating away at our earnings, I'll have to be even more cautious. Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 48,
  ""bob_gain"": 52,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slight edge, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and not giving up too much value due to inflation."
