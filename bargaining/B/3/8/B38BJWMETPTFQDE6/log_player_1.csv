"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This way, I get the majority of the money, but still leave Bob with a decent amount."

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 10% less, so I'm not as eager to give up as much as I was in the first round. Bob's offer is quite generous, but I'm not sure if I should accept it yet. I'll reject it for now and try to get a better deal.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Inflation has taken its toll, and the money is worth even less now. I'll try to get a better deal. Here's my new proposal:

```

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","The money is worth even less now, and I'm running out of time. I'll try to get a decent deal, but I'll have to be realistic. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

I'm splitting the money 50/50, hoping that Bob will accept this fair offer and we can finally end the game."
