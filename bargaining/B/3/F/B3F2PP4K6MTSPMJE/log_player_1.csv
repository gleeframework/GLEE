"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

I'm starting with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping to get the game over quickly and avoid any inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 98, ""bob_gain"": 2}
```

I'm reducing my share slightly, but still offering a large portion to Bob. This should incentivize him to accept, as the inflation is likely to hurt him more in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2 
# Bob gain: 98 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting. Even though Bob is getting a larger share, the inflation is significantly impacting his gains. I'm hoping to hold out for a better offer as the game progresses."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 97, ""bob_gain"": 3}
```

I'm continuing to reduce my share gradually, hoping to find a point where Bob will accept before the inflation impacts him too severely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3 
# Bob gain: 97 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting. Even with the significant inflation on Bob's gains, I'm hoping for a better offer. I'm confident that I can get a larger share, especially considering that I have the advantage of knowing the inflation rate for my own gains."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 96, ""bob_gain"": 4}
```

I'm continuing to reduce my share, but this time by a larger amount. The inflation is starting to bite into Bob's gains, and I believe this offer is starting to become more appealing to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4 
# Bob gain: 96 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even though the inflation is hurting Bob significantly, I'm still rejecting this offer. I'm confident that I can get a larger share in the coming rounds."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5}
```

I'm continuing to reduce my share, but at a slower rate. The inflation is making Bob's offers increasingly less appealing, and I'm confident that I can secure a good deal in the next few rounds."
