I propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor.  This seems like a good starting point, and it gives Bob something to work with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take something, the inflation is already hurting me. It's better to gamble on a more equitable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm still aiming for a larger share, but I'm offering Bob a bit more this time to incentivize acceptance. This reflects the inflation hitting us both, and I'm hoping to avoid another rejection."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. While 2000 is better than nothing, the inflation is heavily impacting me now. I need to hold out for a fairer split, even if it means risking getting nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm taking a bigger risk here, offering a more even split, but inflation is making it hard to keep a majority.  This offer reflects the current value of the money, and I'm hoping it's enough to entice Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject Bob's offer. Even though the inflation is hurting me badly, I still believe I can get a better deal. This is getting very risky, but I'm not ready to give up yet."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm proposing an even split. The inflation is drastically reducing the value of the money, so I'm willing to settle for half.  It's the fairest offer I can make at this point, and hopefully, Bob will see that too."
