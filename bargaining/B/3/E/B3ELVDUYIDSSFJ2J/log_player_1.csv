I'm going for a slightly unfair split in my favor. I want to see if Bob is willing to accept a smaller share in the first round.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob's offer is very unfair! I'm not going to accept that. Let's see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm going to try and compromise a little bit. I'm still aiming for a larger share, but I'm offering Bob a more reasonable amount than in the first round. Let's see if this is acceptable to him."
