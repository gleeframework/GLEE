"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. You can try to negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000, which is 20% of the original amount. This leaves me with $800,000, which is 80% of the original amount. I'm hoping this will be a good starting point for negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable and split the money evenly. This way, we both get a fair share without risking the value of the money dwindling further. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, I'm now looking at a gain of $800,000 being worth $720,000 in real value.

Considering Bob's proposal, I'd rather not split the money evenly, as it would leave me with $500,000 in real value, which is less than my initial offer. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to keep pushing for a better deal, Bob. Your offer is too generous for me at this point.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 10% less than in the previous round, the total value is now $720,000.

I'll make a new proposal, taking into account the decreasing value of the money. I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation. Let's see if you can do better than this.""
}
```"
