Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's offer was 60 for her and 40 for me, I'll try to counter with a similar offer, but slightly more in my favor.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effects of inflation, I'll have to adjust my thinking. Since Alice's offer is still relatively close to the initial split, I'll think about whether it's worth accepting.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's offer was 55 for her and 45 for me, and considering the effects of inflation, I'll try to make a slightly more favorable offer for myself.
