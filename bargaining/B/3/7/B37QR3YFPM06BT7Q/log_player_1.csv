Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This offer is a 60/40 split in my favor, as I am the one making the offer.  I'm starting with a relatively generous offer, hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred a larger share, it's better to accept this 50/50 split.  The inflation is hurting my potential gains, and Bob might make a less favorable offer in the next round."
