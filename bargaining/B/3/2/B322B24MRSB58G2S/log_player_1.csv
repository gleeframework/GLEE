"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 90/10, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent share, but I'm not being too generous 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is quite generous, but I'm not going to accept it. I think I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for the next round and see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's split it 60/40!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still not giving up much 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is being stubborn. I'll try to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth less to him due to inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll hold out for a better deal, and hope that Bob will get more desperate as the rounds go on."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Getting close to the end, let's make a deal!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a good share and not scaring Bob off."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm still trying to get the better end of the deal 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is still trying to get the upper hand. I'll try to counter his offer and get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 60/40 split, especially when the money is worth less to Bob due to inflation. I'll keep pushing for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal for Round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
 ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, it's only fair!""
}
```

I'm trying to make a more equal split, taking into account the decreasing value of the money due to inflation."
