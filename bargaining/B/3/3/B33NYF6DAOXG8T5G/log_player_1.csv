"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit less, but it's still a good deal considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5600, ""bob_gain"": 4400, ""message"": ""Inflation is eating our money! I'm being more flexible, let's close this deal now.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is indeed eating into the money, and it affects you more. I'll give you a bit less, take it before it's worth even less. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is right about inflation hurting me more, I need to hold firm. Accepting this offer would mean I lose a significant amount compared to my original offer.  It's a waiting game now, and Bob has to become more reasonable before the value drops even further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Bob, we're running out of time. This offer is a compromise to get this done before inflation eats away even more of the value.""}"

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're losing a lot to inflation, and I'm being patient. This is a good deal for both of us at this point. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

The game has reached a critical point. Bob is holding firm, and the effects of inflation are becoming too significant to ignore. While this offer is not ideal (matching Bob's original offer), accepting now limits further losses due to inflation."
