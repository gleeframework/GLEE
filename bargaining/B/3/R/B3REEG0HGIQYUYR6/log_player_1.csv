"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going for a fairly aggressive first offer, aiming to secure the majority of the money. It's a risky move, but it's a good starting point to see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly less than my initial offer, and I'm not willing to accept such a drastic reduction. I believe I can still secure a more favorable outcome by continuing to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm offering a compromise, lowering my initial demand but still aiming for a larger share. This should demonstrate my willingness to negotiate, while also maintaining a strong position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, even with the inflation affecting his share. I'm determined to get a better deal than this, and I'm confident I can still secure a more favorable outcome in the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but still aiming for a larger share. I'm trying to find a balance between being reasonable and securing a good deal for myself. This offer should show Bob that I'm willing to compromise but also that I'm not willing to accept a drastically unfair split."
