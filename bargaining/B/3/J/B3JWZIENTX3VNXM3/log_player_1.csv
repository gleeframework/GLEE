"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair!""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $400,000, which is a significant amount, and I'll take $600,000. I'm trying to be generous while also considering my own interests. Since the money doesn't lose value for me but does for Bob, I'm hoping he'll be motivated to accept this offer rather than risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds. The message ""Let's be fair!"" is meant to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept the offer without feeling taken advantage of."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want to be fair, but time is money! Let's make a deal. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\nI reject Bob's offer because it gives him the larger share, and considering the inflation, his share is actually worth less than what I offered him in the first round. I believe I can negotiate for a better deal in the next rounds, especially since the inflation affects Bob's gains but not mine. By rejecting this offer, I'm hoping to pressure Bob into making a more favorable proposal or to wait for a chance to make a counteroffer that benefits me more."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Consider the inflation!""}\n\nIn this round, I've decided to increase my share to $650,000 and offer Bob $350,000. Given that the money loses 20% of its value for Bob with each round, the actual value of what I'm offering him is significantly less than it was in the first round. However, I'm trying to make a point with the message ""Consider the inflation!"" to remind Bob that the longer we negotiate, the less the money is worth to him. This is an attempt to create a sense of urgency and make him consider accepting my offer before the value of his potential gain decreases further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The clock is ticking, and we both lose with every round.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\nI reject Bob's offer again because, despite his claim that this is his final offer and the pressure of the clock ticking, the deal still doesn't favor me as much as I believe it could. Given the significant devaluation of Bob's share due to inflation (now worth 48.8% less than in the first round), I'm in a stronger negotiating position. Bob's share of $550,000 is actually worth much less in real terms, making his offer less appealing. I'm betting that Bob's urgency might lead him to accept a less favorable deal in the next rounds or that I can propose a better split that he'll accept due to the mounting pressure of losing value with each passing round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Time is on my side.""}\n\nIn this round, I've increased my share to $700,000 and offered Bob $300,000. Given the significant impact of inflation on Bob's potential gains, I believe I'm in a strong position to negotiate a better deal for myself. The message ""Time is on my side"" is intended to remind Bob that with each passing round, the value of his potential gain decreases, while mine remains unaffected. This is a strategic move to pressure Bob into accepting my offer, as the longer we negotiate, the less he stands to gain in real terms. I'm hoping that the mounting pressure and the realization that time is indeed on my side will prompt Bob to accept this offer, which, despite being less favorable to him, might seem more appealing than risking further devaluation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the only fair outcome. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\nI reject Bob's offer of a 50/50 split because, given the current state of inflation affecting his share, a ""fair"" split in terms of the original value would actually be heavily skewed in my favor. Bob's share of $500,000 is now worth 67.23% less than in the first round, making his actual gain significantly less than mine. Bob's attempt to appeal to fairness and his ""take it or leave it"" stance is a negotiation tactic, but I recognize that accepting this offer would mean giving up the advantage that the inflation dynamic has given me. I'm betting that the pressure of losing value will eventually force Bob to accept a deal that is more favorable to me, so I'm choosing to continue negotiating."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000, ""message"": ""Inflation is biting, isn't it?""}\n\nIn this round, I've decided to increase my share to $750,000 and offer Bob $250,000. Given that the money Bob gains is now worth 67.23% less than in the first round due to inflation, and considering my previous offers and his rejection of them, I believe it's time to push for an even more favorable deal. The message ""Inflation is biting, isn't it?"" is a reminder to Bob of the significant impact inflation is having on his potential gains and is intended to make him realize that the longer he holds out, the less he will actually get. This is a strategic move to pressure Bob into accepting my offer, as it becomes increasingly clear that time is not on his side."
