"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I think this is a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
 
I'm not going to settle for a 40/60 split right off the bat, especially since the money is worth less in later rounds. I'm going to try and negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think we can do better than that, Alice.  Let's split it 55/45. It's a fairer deal for both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting us nowhere. I'm willing to take a little less, but I need you to be more reasonable. Time is running out! 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

I'm still not happy with this split, even with the time pressure. I'm going to try and push for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. We need to come to an agreement soon. I'm willing to take 45, but we both need to be flexible to avoid losing everything.""}
