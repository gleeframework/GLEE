"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose a 900,000 - 100,000 split in my favor. I'm being generous in the first round, hoping for a quick resolution.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly less than my previous offer. It is worth rejecting and attempting to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

I'm offering a 750,000 - 250,000 split, still in my favor but recognizing that Bob needs to be given a more significant share to potentially accept.  The inflation is starting to bite, and I need to make a move before it gets worse."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still not good enough, even with the inflation.  I'm losing value much faster than him, and I need to push for a more equitable split to avoid getting a very bad deal later in the game."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering a 600,000 - 400,000 split.  I'm reducing my share, but it's still significantly higher than Bob's last offer.  I'm hoping he recognizes the value of getting a larger share before the inflation continues to erode his gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation is getting out of hand, and I am losing value much faster than Bob.  Accepting this offer ensures a 50/50 split and prevents me from risking getting a much worse deal in the remaining rounds."
