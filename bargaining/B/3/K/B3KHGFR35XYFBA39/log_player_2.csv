"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5 
# Alice gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is a very unfair offer, and it's worth trying to negotiate a better deal. There are 12 rounds, and the money is worth less each round, so there's time to try and get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}
``` 
 
I propose an equal split of the money.  This is a fair and reasonable starting point, and it shows that I'm willing to negotiate in good faith."
