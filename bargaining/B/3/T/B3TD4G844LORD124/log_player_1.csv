"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I propose taking 900,000 dollars for myself and leaving 100,000 dollars for Bob. I figure this is a fair offer since it gives Bob a decent amount while still leaving me with the majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
