"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

This offer splits the $10,000 evenly between us, with each of us receiving $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly lower amount, but I think this is a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less due to inflation, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 4000 / 0.95 = 4210.53
* Bob gain: 6000 / 0.95 = 6315.79

I'll accept Bob's offer.
