"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the $10,000, leaving Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less for me now, and Bob's offer is actually worse than my previous offer, I will reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the decreasing value of the money due to inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher percentage this time. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another identical offer from Bob! Given the significant decrease in the value of the money, I think I can do better than this. I'll reject the offer again.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly due to inflation. I'll aim for an even higher percentage this time to account for the loss in value. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This is the same as my initial offer, but with the decreasing value of money in mind."
