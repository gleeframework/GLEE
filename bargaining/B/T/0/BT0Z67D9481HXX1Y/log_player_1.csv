"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take it 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take advantage of the situation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer. I'm not willing to give up 70% of the remaining amount. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth even less now. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""A bit more balanced this time. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42-58 split, which takes into account the decreased value of the money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're still being too generous, I'll take it 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take advantage of the situation again.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer. The 45-55 split is not favorable to me, and I'm hoping Bob will make a more generous offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""message"": ""Getting closer to a fair split. Accept and we can end this.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 48-52 split, trying to find a middle ground that might be more acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not getting any younger, I want more 
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to squeeze out a bit more. However, this offer is actually a slight improvement for me.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer. A 52-48 split is not ideal, but it's a decent compromise, and I'm willing to end the game here."
