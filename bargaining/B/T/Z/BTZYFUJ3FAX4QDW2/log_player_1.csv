"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor, as I'm only losing 5% of the value per round while Bob loses 10%.  This seems like a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While a 50/50 split isn't ideal for me, considering the inflation, the money I gain is now worth less.  Accepting this offer ensures I get something, and the value loss will be less significant than if I reject and risk losing even more in the next round."
