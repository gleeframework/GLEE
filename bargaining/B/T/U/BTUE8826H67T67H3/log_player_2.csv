"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'm willing to give you a significant share, but I need the majority to be profitable. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer was quite low for me. I'm proposing a more even split this time.  Let's be realistic - the clock is ticking and we both lose if this fails.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I understand your position. I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger share to make it worth my time. Let's aim for a more sustainable deal this time. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is inching upwards, but it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  We need to show strength and willingness to walk away, or she'll keep lowballing.  The inflation hurts, but it hurts less than a terrible deal."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close, but your offer still heavily favors you.  This split is more in line with the urgency of the situation. Time is literally money for me!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to concede more, Bob, but I need a larger share to be motivated. This is a fair compromise considering the shrinking time and our individual needs. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to use the time pressure against me, framing her offer as ""generous"" due to the shrinking pot.  However, her offer is worse than round 3!  I need to hold firm and show I'm willing to risk it all, or she'll keep lowballing me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  My offer is more than fair, and the clock is ticking.  I'm standing firm - take this deal or let's both walk away empty-handed.""} 

**Reasoning:** 

It's a gamble, but Alice needs to understand I'm serious.  Repeating my previous offer with a strong message might be enough to get her to finally agree. We're running out of time, and she needs to realize that a 60/40 split in her favor is the best she's likely to get."
