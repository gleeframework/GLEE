"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving us both $500,000 each. This is a good starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share for now. Let's see if we can reach an agreement before the inflation hits too hard. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's proposal.

Since I get $400,000, which is worth the same as in the first round, and Bob gets $600,000, which is worth 10% less than in the first round, I think this is a reasonable offer. I'm not sure if I'll get a better deal later, so I'll accept this offer.
