45.0,55.0,"I understand the inflation puts me at a disadvantage, but 40% is too low. How about we meet in the middle at 55/45?",Bob,2,

50.0,50.0,"Alice, it's clear we both want to maximize our gains. I'm proposing a 50/50 split to end this fairly before inflation eats away at my share any further.",Bob,4,
