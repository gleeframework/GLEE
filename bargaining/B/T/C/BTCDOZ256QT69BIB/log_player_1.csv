"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering you $400,000, and I'll take the remaining $600,000. It's a fair deal, don't you think?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to be more careful with my decision.

I'll reject this offer from Bob. My gain of $300,000 is worth less than my gain of $600,000 in the first round, and I think I can do better than that.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the second round, I'll aim to get a better deal. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, and we can finally settle this!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but not that much! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth even less due to inflation, I'll have to be even more cautious. However, this offer from Bob seems a bit more generous than the previous ones. I'll accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
