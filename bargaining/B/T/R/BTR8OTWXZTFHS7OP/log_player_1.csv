"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, I'll take the first 60%""}

I'm proposing to take 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and leaving $40 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we should split it more evenly, I'll take the first 60% this time 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't think Bob's offer is a good one for me, considering the inflation. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, I'd like to get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and the previous offers, I'll make a new proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'll take a slightly smaller share this time, but I still think I deserve a bit more due to my initial proposal""}

I'm proposing to take 55% of the remaining $100, which is $55, and leaving $45 for Bob."
