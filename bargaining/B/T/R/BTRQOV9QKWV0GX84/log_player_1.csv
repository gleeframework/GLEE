"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me 600,000 dollars and Bob 400,000 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slight adjustment, but still a fair split 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to consider the impact of inflation on the offer. Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

I'm not convinced that this offer is the best I can get, so I'll reject it.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. I'll aim to get a bit more, considering the reduced value of the money.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000,
  ""message"": ""A slight increase for me, still a fair split""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A compromise, but still a good deal 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are starting to add up! With the money being worth 48.8% less for me and 14.26% less for Bob, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

After considering the reduced value of the money, I think this offer is a good one. I'll accept it.
