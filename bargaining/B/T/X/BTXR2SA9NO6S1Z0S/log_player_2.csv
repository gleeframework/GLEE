"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share this round, but I'm open to negotiation in the future. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While it's tempting to take the $1000 now, it's a very small share. Rejecting allows me to propose a more equitable split in the next round, and I can use the threat of further inflation to my advantage."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly this time. We can discuss a different split in the future if we both agree.""}
