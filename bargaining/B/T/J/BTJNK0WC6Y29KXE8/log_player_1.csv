"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets the remaining 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less in the second round, I'll calculate the actual amount I'll get:

$50 * 0.95 (since it's 5% less than the original $100) = $47.50

Bob's offer is to split the money 50/50, which means I'll get $47.50 and Bob will get $47.50.

I'll accept this offer.
