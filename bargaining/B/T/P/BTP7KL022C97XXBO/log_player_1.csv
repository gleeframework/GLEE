"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly and be done with it!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair and straightforward way to divide the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but still a fair deal! 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with the 3:1 ratio proposed by Bob. I think I deserve a better share, considering I'm the one who made the initial offer. I'll reject this proposal and try to make a new one that's more favorable to me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 375000, ""bob_gain"": 625000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think this is a more reasonable split""}

I'm trying to find a balance between my initial proposal and Bob's offer. I'm willing to give him a slightly larger share, but I still want to keep a decent amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, but I'm willing to give you a small consolation prize 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm really unhappy with the 4:1 ratio proposed by Bob. The consolation prize of $200,000 is not enough to make up for the significant difference in the split. I think I deserve a better deal, considering the initial offer I made. I'll reject this proposal and try to make a new one that's more favorable to me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 300000, ""bob_gain"": 700000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I still want a decent chunk""}

I'm trying to find a compromise that's closer to Bob's previous offers, but still gives me a significant share. I'm willing to give him a larger share, but I want to keep a substantial amount for myself."
