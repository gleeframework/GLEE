I propose a 900,000 to 100,000 split. I believe this is a fair offer, as it gives Bob a significant portion of the money. I'm confident he'll accept it and we can move on to more important things."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 927272.73 
# Bob gain: 72727.27 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
