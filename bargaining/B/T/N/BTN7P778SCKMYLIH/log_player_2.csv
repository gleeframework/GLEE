"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Alice's offer was to give me $100,000, I'll try to counter with a higher amount. Considering the 20% inflation, I'll offer:

{""bob_gain"": 120000, ""alice_gain"": 880000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I'll think carefully before making a decision. Since Alice's offer is higher than my previous offer, I'll consider it a decent proposal. I'll accept it this time.
