Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, not me. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the time pressure and the impact of inflation on Bob's potential gains. While the offer is slightly better than her previous one, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  Bob needs to hold firm and hope Alice starts making more serious concessions soon."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""This is a fair and final offer.  Let's split it evenly and avoid losing everything.""}

**Reasoning:**

It's time for a bold move to counter Alice's stalling tactics.  Offering a 50/50 split sends a clear message:  

* **Fairness:** Bob is demonstrating a willingness to compromise and find a mutually agreeable solution. 
* **Urgency:**  The clock is ticking, and this even split emphasizes the risk of walking away with nothing. 

While Bob could push for a slightly higher amount, the longer the negotiations drag on, the more his potential gains shrink due to inflation. This 50/50 offer represents a balance between maximizing his potential earnings and securing a deal before time runs out."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your 'fair' is too late. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly not budging and is content to let the clock run down. While this offer is far from ideal, it's the best Bob is likely to get at this point. Accepting avoids the risk of getting nothing if the rounds run out."
