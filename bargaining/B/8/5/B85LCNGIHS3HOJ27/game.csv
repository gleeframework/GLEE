,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,I'm not sure about your initial proposal. I'm willing to start with a 55/45 split in my favor.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
50.0,50.0,"Let's try an even split this time. We've both had a chance to make our initial proposals, so a 50/50 split seems like a fair compromise. What do you say?",Alice,3,
