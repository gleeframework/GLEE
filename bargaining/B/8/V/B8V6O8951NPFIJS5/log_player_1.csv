"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, giving Bob 40% of the initial $1,000,000. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since Bob's offer is 50-50, I'll have to decide whether to accept it or not.

After considering the reduced value of the money, I'll choose to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the money worth 40% less than in the first round, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This offer gives Bob a slightly smaller share, but still a decent 45% of the reduced value of the money. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Déjà vu! It seems Bob is repeating his previous offer, but with the reduced value of money. I'll have to think carefully about this one again.

Considering the significant reduction in the value of the money, I'll choose to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the money worth 68.8% less than in the first round, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}
```

This offer gives Bob a slightly larger share, taking into account the reduced value of the money. Let's see if he accepts!"
