"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

This is a fair starting point. I'm offering Bob a smaller share, but it's still a decent amount, and it ensures I get the majority.  Let's see what Bob does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly less favorable to me than my initial proposal.  I'm confident I can do better, even with the risk of further inflation.  Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to account for the potential for further inflation.  However, I'm still offering a significant amount to Bob, and I believe this is a fair compromise.  Let's see if he accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my initial proposal, and the inflation is starting to become a real factor.  I'm not willing to accept this offer, as I believe I can still get a better deal. Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again to account for the increasing inflation, but I'm still holding onto a significant majority of the money.  This is a risky move, but I believe that I can still get a better deal than Bob is offering.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough call, as the inflation is really hurting Bob's share. However, I've been holding out for a better deal, and it's clear that Bob is becoming increasingly desperate. Accepting this offer guarantees me a significant share, and while I'm not thrilled about the 50/50 split, it's the best I can reasonably expect given the circumstances."
