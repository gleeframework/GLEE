"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you 40%""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $100, which is $40. I'll take the remaining 60%, which is $60."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair to split it evenly since we're both taking a hit from inflation. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, my gain of $40 is actually worth $32 (40% of $80, which is the value of the original $100 after the first round's inflation).

I'll consider Bob's offer. Since we're both taking a hit from inflation, splitting it evenly does seem fair. I'll accept Bob's offer.
