"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very greedy offer.  I'll take almost everything and leave Bob with a single dollar.  I figure he might be tempted to accept, but if not, I'll have 11 more rounds to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer. It's a fair split, and I'd rather not risk getting nothing by rejecting and hoping for a better offer in the next rounds."
