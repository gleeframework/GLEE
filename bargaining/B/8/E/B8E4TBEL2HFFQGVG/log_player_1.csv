"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money in an 80/20 ratio, with you receiving $2000. I believe this is fair given the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 50/50 split.  It's a fair and simple solution, and we both get a decent amount even with the inflation factor. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
