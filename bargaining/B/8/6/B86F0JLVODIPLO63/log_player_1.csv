"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it 60-40. We both get a good amount, and we avoid losing value due to inflation.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is a significant amount, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation. The message is intended to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and the shared goal of avoiding losses due to inflation. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split is fairer, as I'm taking on the risk of inflation being higher for me. Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

  ""bob_gain"": 4200,
