"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take the lion's share, but I'm willing to negotiate. Let's see if we can find a more balanced split. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible starting offer!  While I'm willing to negotiate, Alice's offer is heavily skewed in her favor. The inflation works in my favor, so I'm confident I can get a much better deal in subsequent rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Alice. I'm proposing a much fairer split this time. Take it while it's still a good deal for you, considering the inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still not happy with the proposed split. This is my final offer, Bob. Let's find a compromise before the inflation eats away at our gains even further. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation, and this offer is significantly better than her first one. While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting now prevents further losses due to inflation. It's a decent compromise."
