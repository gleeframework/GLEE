  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it with a 60-40 ratio""

I'm offering Bob 40% of the money, which I think is a generous offer considering I'm the one making the first proposal. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split, with me getting the larger share, is more fair.  After all, we're both taking a hit on the value of the money with each round! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
