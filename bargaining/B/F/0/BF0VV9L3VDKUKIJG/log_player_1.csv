"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept and we can split the money fairly!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable for a fair division of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take this or leave it, I'm not budging! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. With the 10% reduction in value due to inflation, Bob's offer is actually a 70-30 split in his favor, which is a pretty significant difference from the 60-40 split I initially proposed.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time, taking into account the inflation and Bob's previous offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You're being too greedy, Bob! Meet me in the middle!""
}
```

I'm trying to push the split back towards a more even 55-45 ratio, but still leaving some room for Bob to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not backing down, but I'm willing to compromise a bit. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to push the split even further in his favor, but I'm not going to let him get away with it. The 27.1% reduction in value due to inflation means that Bob's offer is actually a 59.1-40.9 split, which is still not acceptable to me.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","It's getting down to the wire, and I need to make a strong move to get a good deal. Considering the inflation and Bob's previous offers, I'll try to push the split even further in my favor.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""It's time to meet me halfway, Bob! 50-50 is a fair split!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a more even distribution of the remaining money. Let's see if Bob will finally accept!"
