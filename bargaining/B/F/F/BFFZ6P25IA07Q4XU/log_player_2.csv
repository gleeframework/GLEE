**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer seems to be moving in Bob's favor, it's important to remember that the value of the money is decreasing rapidly for Alice due to inflation.  This means she's getting increasingly desperate for a deal, even if it means accepting a smaller share than she initially wanted. Bob can likely secure a better deal by continuing to hold out."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 525000, ""alice_gain"": 475000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic.  This offer is more than fair considering the time constraint and inflation working against you.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

- **Time Pressure:** We're past the halfway point, and the pressure is mounting on both players. 
- **Exploiting Inflation:** Alice's buying power is significantly diminished with each round. Bob can leverage this by offering slightly more than before, knowing that the real value for Alice is less than it appears. 
- **Appearing Reasonable:**  The message aims to portray Bob as practical and somewhat generous, potentially nudging Alice towards acceptance."
