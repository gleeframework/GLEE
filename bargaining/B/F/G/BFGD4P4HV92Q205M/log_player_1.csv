"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

This is a fairly standard 60-40 split, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it to get the game over with quickly."

# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 5% decrease in value of my gain due to inflation, I'm not as eager to accept a 50-50 split as I was in the first round. I think I can do better. I'll reject Bob's offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the 5% decrease in value of my gain due to inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of money. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm offering a slightly more favorable split for myself, but still a reasonable offer considering the circumstances."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing rapidly! With the significant decrease in value of my gain, I'm getting more cautious. However, Bob's offer is actually more favorable to me than my previous offer, considering the inflation. I think I should take it.
