"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a fair offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

This way, we both get an equal share of the $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, but the money Bob gains is worth 20% less, I should take a more aggressive stance to compensate for the difference.

I'll reject this offer and make a counter-proposal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I want to take advantage of the fact that Bob's money is worth 20% less, I'll make a proposal that gives me a larger share.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}"
