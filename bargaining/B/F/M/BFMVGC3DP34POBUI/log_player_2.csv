"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 80% of its original value due to the 20% inflation, I'll make a proposal that takes this into account.

{""bob_gain"": 40, ""alice_gain"": 60}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the new inflation rate, I'll evaluate Alice's offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 36% less than in the first round, I'll consider the effective value of the money I gain in this round. 

In the first round, $50 was worth 100% of its value, and now it's worth 64% of its original value (100% - 36%). So, $45 in this round is equivalent to $28.20 in the first round.

Considering this, I'll decide whether to accept Alice's offer.
