"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor.  This is a fair starting point, considering the inflation will impact Bob's share more than mine.  Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is very unfair, and even though I'm losing money faster than him, I'm confident I can get a better deal. I'll reject this and make a counter-offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor.  While I'm losing value quicker, I'm willing to compromise to avoid a stalemate.  This offer is more fair than Bob's previous proposal and should give him some incentive to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, even with the inflation.  I'm willing to take a smaller share than I originally proposed, but I need to ensure I get at least 400,000.  I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000}
```

This is my final compromise. I'm taking a significant hit due to inflation, but I need to secure at least 400,000.  This offer is fair considering the circumstances and the decreasing value of the money.  I hope Bob realizes that it's better to accept than risk losing everything."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'm losing a significant amount of value due to inflation, Bob's offer is finally getting closer to a reasonable split. Accepting this will ensure I get something, and I'm not willing to risk losing everything by continuing to reject his offers. It's time to compromise and take what I can get."
