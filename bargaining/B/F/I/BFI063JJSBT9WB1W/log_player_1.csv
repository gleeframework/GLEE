"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This way, I get a decent amount to start with, and Bob still gets a significant share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before accepting. With the offer on the table, I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I want to get more money, and I'm not convinced that 5000 is the best I can get. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the decreasing value of money due to inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes this into account. Here's my proposal for round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

This time, I'm offering a slightly higher amount to me, but still leaving a decent share for Bob."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is catching up quickly! Considering the decreased value of money, I'll think carefully about Bob's new offer. I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not convinced that I should give up more money to Bob, especially since the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. I'll try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With the rapid inflation, I'll need to adjust my strategy. Here's my proposal for round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm trying to get back to the original ratio from round 1, but taking into account the decreased value of money."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll! Considering the rapidly decreasing value of money, I'll think carefully about Bob's new offer. I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm not getting any younger, and I don't want to risk going home with nothing. This offer is getting closer to the original ratio, and I don't see a better opportunity on the horizon."
