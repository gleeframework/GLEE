"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, it's a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking a slight advantage, but I'm open to negotiation.  Let's see what you propose next! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is affecting me, and I need to be strategic.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Too generous on your part, Bob. I'll try to get a better deal.""
}
```

I'm hoping to get a better split in the next round, considering the inflation factor."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer, I'll try to get a better deal. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you in the middle, but I'm not giving up much more.""
}
```

I'm trying to get a slightly better split, taking into account the 5% decrease in value due to inflation."
