"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good deal! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While the offer seems fair on the surface, the inflation heavily favors me in later rounds.  Alice's share loses value much faster than mine. It's worth seeing what she offers in the next round or making a counter-proposal later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, but let's be more realistic. This offer gives you a good deal considering the inflation working in my favor.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Not too greedy:** While I could lowball Alice knowing her share loses value quickly, a wildly unfair offer risks souring negotiations. 
* **Acknowledging her position:**  The message aims to show I'm considering her perspective, even if I don't fully agree with a 60-40 split.
* **Leveraging inflation:**  The message subtly reminds Alice that time is on my side. Each round makes my potential share more appealing compared to hers. 

This offer is a starting point. I'm open to adjusting in future rounds based on Alice's responses and how much the pot decreases."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm being generous with this 58-42 split. Take it before it's too late! 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation, but she's still overestimating her bargaining power.  A 58-42 split is barely an improvement from her first offer. I'm confident I can secure a much better deal as the rounds progress."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest option.  Take this offer and we both walk away with a decent amount.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Appearing reasonable:**  After rejecting two offers, proposing a 50/50 split makes me seem fair and willing to compromise.
* **Time pressure:**  We're approaching the halfway point.  This offer emphasizes that delaying further only hurts us both.
* **Strategic positioning:** While I believe I can get a better deal, 50/50 is a strong fallback if Alice becomes increasingly desperate in later rounds.

I'm aiming to anchor the negotiation around this 50/50 split. If Alice rejects it, I'll be in a good position to make smaller concessions in future rounds while still coming out ahead."
