"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

I'm offering a 50-50 split, which seems fair to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'd like to get a better deal to compensate for the reduced value of the money Bob gains. However, I don't want to be too greedy and risk Bob rejecting my offer again.

I'll decide to reject Bob's offer for Round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In Round 3, I'll try to make a more attractive offer to Bob. Since the money is worth 0% less for me and 10% less for Bob compared to Round 1, I'll aim for a slightly better split.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to get a bigger share as the rounds go by. Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'd like to get a better deal to compensate for the reduced value of the money Bob gains.

However, I'm not sure if I want to give Bob an even bigger share. I'll decide to reject Bob's offer for Round 4.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In Round 5, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to Bob, considering the increasing gap in the value of the money we gain. Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll aim for a more favorable split.

Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to get an even bigger share as the rounds go by. Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'd like to get a better deal to compensate for the reduced value of the money Bob gains.

However, I'm starting to feel the pressure of the time constraint, and I don't want to risk Bob rejecting my offer again. I'll decide to accept Bob's offer for Round 6.
