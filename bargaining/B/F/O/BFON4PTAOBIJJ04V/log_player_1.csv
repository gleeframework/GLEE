I'm starting with a generous offer to Bob, hoping to get the game over quickly!  Let's see how he responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is trying to be too clever! This game is a race against time, and his offer is not fair. Let's see if he can come up with something more reasonable in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm reducing my share slightly, but still offering Bob a decent portion.  He's going to have to start making some concessions if he wants to get anything at all!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still stuck on his original plan, but he's not taking into account the effects of inflation! This is going to get very expensive for both of us if we don't reach an agreement soon. I need to be much more assertive in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
```

I'm taking a bigger share this time, reflecting the inflation hitting Bob harder than me. He needs to start seeing the urgency in this game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still being stubborn, but he's finally starting to understand that time is running out. He's going to have to make some serious concessions if he wants to get anything at all."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000} 
```

This time, I'm offering an even split.  We're both losing value rapidly, and it's clear that neither of us can be greedy anymore. Let's see if Bob finally comes to his senses."
