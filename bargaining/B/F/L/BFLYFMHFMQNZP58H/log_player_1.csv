Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that. Let's start with a more balanced split.  I'll take 55, you take 45.  This gives us a good starting point for negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 45

{
""alice_gain"": 58,

""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but the deal is getting worse for me with each round due to inflation. How about we meet in the middle? I'll take $58, you take $42.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're both losing value with each round. Let's be reasonable and split the money evenly. 50/50 is the fairest way to go, and we can both get something instead of nothing. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
Although not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this point makes the most sense. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The value of the money is decreasing for me significantly with each round. Waiting any longer will only result in a worse deal, even if Bob eventually agrees to a slightly higher split.
* **Risk of Losing Everything:** If we don't reach an agreement in the remaining rounds, we both get nothing. A 50/50 split ensures I at least get something.
* **Bob's Stance:**  Bob seems fixated on a ""fair"" split, which implies he might not budge much from this offer. 

While I could gamble on getting a slightly better deal in later rounds, the risk associated with it outweighs the potential reward at this stage."
