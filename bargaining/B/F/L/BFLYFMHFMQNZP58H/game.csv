,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"I think we can both do better than that. Let's start with a more balanced split.  I'll take 55, you take 45.  This gives us a good starting point for negotiation.",Bob,2,

50.0,50.0,"Alice, we're both losing value with each round. Let's be reasonable and split the money evenly. 50/50 is the fairest way to go, and we can both get something instead of nothing.",Bob,4,
