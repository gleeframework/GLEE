"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, as it's a fair and equal division of the $100. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more, but still a fair deal! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this new offer. With inflation, my gain of $30 is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, so it's actually $24 in today's value. Bob's gain of $70 is still worth $70.

Considering the decreasing value of money, I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer. I'd rather try to get a better deal. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In this round, my gain is worth 64% of what it was in the first round (80% * 80% = 64%). I'll make a new offer that takes this into account.

Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 32,
  ""bob_gain"": 68,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a bit less, but still a fair deal!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 32/68 split, which I hope Bob will find acceptable."
