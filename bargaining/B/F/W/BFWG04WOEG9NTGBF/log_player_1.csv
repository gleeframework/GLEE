"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm starting with a fairly generous offer, giving Bob a significant amount. I'm hoping this will encourage him to accept in the first round, avoiding any potential inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm rejecting this offer. While I understand the concept of inflation and that the money is worth less now, this offer is significantly less favorable than my initial proposal. I'm confident I can secure a better deal for myself in the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

I'm adjusting my offer slightly. Given that Bob rejected my initial proposal, I'm lowering my share slightly to make it more appealing while still maintaining a significant portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is getting increasingly unfavorable, but I'm still rejecting it. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can secure a better deal for myself in the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm again adjusting my offer, lowering my share slightly in hopes of reaching an agreement. While inflation is a factor, I'm still aiming for a significant portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is extremely unfavorable, with Bob taking the vast majority of the money. I'm rejecting it and will continue to negotiate for a fairer share in the remaining rounds. Even with the impact of inflation, I believe I can secure a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

With inflation continuing to bite, I'm offering an even split. It's the most equitable solution at this point and hopefully will incentivize Bob to accept, preventing further losses from inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is completely unacceptable, with Bob taking almost all the money. While inflation is a significant factor, I am determined to secure a more equitable split, even if it means risking losing all the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000}
```

With inflation increasing, I'm lowering my share again. I believe this is the most reasonable offer at this point, while still giving Bob a significant advantage. I'm hoping he will accept this offer to avoid further losses from inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 86.58% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is extremely unfair and leaves me with barely anything.  Despite the significant inflation, I am determined to hold out for a better deal. Even if it means losing all the money, I refuse to accept such a meager share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 300000, ""bob_gain"": 700000}
```

With only two rounds remaining, inflation is eating away at the money rapidly. I'm offering Bob a larger share in hopes he'll finally accept. I believe this is the best chance to avoid losing everything."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 91.41% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is absurd.  It's clear that Bob is trying to take advantage of the situation, but I won't accept being given only $1. While I understand the immense impact of inflation, I cannot accept such a disproportionate division of the money. It is better to lose everything than to accept this offer and be left with nothing but pride."
