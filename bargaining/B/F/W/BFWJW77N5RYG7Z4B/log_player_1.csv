"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob!""
}
```

This means I'm offering to take 900,000 dollars and leaving Bob with 100,000 dollars. The message is a bit cheeky, but I'm hoping to get a good deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split the money evenly, Alice. It's fair and reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","A more reasonable proposal from Bob! Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not interested in splitting it 50/50, I think I can do better than that!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""You can do better than that, Bob!""
}
```

I'm increasing my offer, but still leaving Bob with a significant amount of money. Let's see if he'll take it this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair division, Alice. Let's split it 60/40. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","A new offer from Bob! Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think 60/40 is a fair division, and I'm willing to accept Bob's offer. I'll take 400,000 dollars and Bob will take 600,000 dollars. It's a good compromise!"
