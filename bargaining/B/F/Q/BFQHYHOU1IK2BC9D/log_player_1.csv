"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I'm going for a large share initially, hoping Bob will accept to avoid risking getting less in the next round due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
I'll accept Bob's offer. Even though I get less than my initial proposal, it's still a good deal considering the inflation and the risk of getting even less in future rounds."
