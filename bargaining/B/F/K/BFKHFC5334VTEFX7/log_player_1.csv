"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, it's a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%. I think this is a good starting point, and it's a fair split."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but it's still a decent offer! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the reduced offer, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me only 30% of the total, especially since the money is worth less due to inflation. I'd like to make a counteroffer and try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""I'll meet you halfway, let's try to find a compromise!""}

I'm proposing a slightly more generous offer, giving me 45% of the total and Bob 55%. I'm trying to find a middle ground and hope that Bob will be willing to accept this compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm still not willing to give up too much! 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the reduced offer again, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm still not willing to accept an offer that gives me only 35% of the total, especially since the money is worth even less due to inflation. I'd like to make another counteroffer and try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60, ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not giving up too much either!""}

I'm proposing a slightly more generous offer, giving me 40% of the total and Bob 60%. I'm trying to find a balance between my own gain and Bob's, and hope that this offer will be more acceptable to him."
