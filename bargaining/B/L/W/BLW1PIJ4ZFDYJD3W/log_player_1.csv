"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 90% of the money, and you can have the remaining 10%.  This is a fair offer, as I'm taking the risk of rejection and the next round's inflation will only further incentivize me to take a larger share. Let's end this now. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
