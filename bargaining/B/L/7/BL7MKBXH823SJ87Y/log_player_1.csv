"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Accept and we can split the remaining 12 rounds between us!""
}
```

This offer gives me $800,000 and Bob $200,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can move on to the next round, where I'll have the chance to make another proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm offering a more even split, let's be fair and avoid the risk of losing more money in the next rounds. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth 10% less, so the total amount is now $900,000.

I'm not thrilled about the uneven split, but Bob's message makes sense. I'd rather take a smaller share now and avoid the risk of losing more in future rounds. I accept Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
