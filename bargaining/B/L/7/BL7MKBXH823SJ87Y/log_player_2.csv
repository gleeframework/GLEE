"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Accept and we can split the remaining 12 rounds between us! 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's important to remember that the money is worth less with each round.  Bob can likely do better by rejecting and proposing his own offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
