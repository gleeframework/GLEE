"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take a smaller share, let's keep negotiating! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth 10% less for me, I'll consider the offer in terms of the reduced value. Bob's offer is for me to get $20, which is 20% of the initial $100, but since it's worth 10% less, it's equivalent to 22.22% of the initial $100.

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'm willing to consider it. I'll decide to...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 50-50 split!""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I want more! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth 27.1% less for me, I'll consider the offer in terms of the reduced value. Bob's offer is for me to get $30, which is 30% of the initial $100, but since it's worth 27.1% less, it's equivalent to 21.3% of the initial $100.

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'm willing to consider it. I'll decide to...

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60, ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give away all my share!""}

I'm proposing a 40-60 split, which is a bit more generous than my previous offer, but I'm still holding onto a significant portion of the initial $100."
