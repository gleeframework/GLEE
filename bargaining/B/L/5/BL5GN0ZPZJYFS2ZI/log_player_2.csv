"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I take a bit more since I lose more if we drag this out. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. While I'm getting a decent amount, the inflation will eat away at my earnings quickly. I want to see what Alice will offer if she's forced to make a proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's try this: I take a bit more this time to compensate for the inflation, but you still get a good share.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer. Let's be reasonable and wrap this up. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still going to reject this offer. While it's the same as the initial offer, inflation is hitting me harder than Alice. I need to see if I can negotiate a better deal for myself, or risk getting nothing at all."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Alice, inflation is hitting us both, but we're losing more value with each passing round.  Let's split this evenly and get the best possible outcome for both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but we're losing serious money.  Meet me in the middle - this is getting ridiculous. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While I'm getting a bit more than the initial offer, I'm still losing a lot of value due to inflation.  I need to see if I can get a more even split before the money becomes worthless."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, we're both losing a lot with each round. Let's be reasonable and split the money evenly. It's the best chance we have to get something worthwhile.""}
