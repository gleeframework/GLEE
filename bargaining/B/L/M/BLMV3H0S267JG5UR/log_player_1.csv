"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that we divide the $100 60/40, with me getting $60 and you getting $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my $60 gain from the first round is now worth $48.

I'm not sure if I want to meet Bob in the middle, since I was hoping for a slightly better deal. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With another round of inflation, my potential gain is now worth 64% of what it was in the first round. I'll aim for a slightly higher share this time.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, hoping Bob will be willing to accept a slightly better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting close, Alice, but I'm not giving up yet! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With another round of inflation, my potential gain is now worth a mere 51.2% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not thrilled with Bob's 55/45 offer, but I'm getting a bit desperate. I'll accept this offer to avoid further losses due to inflation.
