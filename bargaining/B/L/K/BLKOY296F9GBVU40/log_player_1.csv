"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you $2,000 and keep $8,000 for myself.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's compromise and split it down the middle, Alice. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less in the second round, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 4500
* Bob gain: 4500

I accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
