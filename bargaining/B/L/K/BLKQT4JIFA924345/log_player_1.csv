"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, 60-40 in my favor.""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $10,000, which is $6,000, and Bob gets 40%, which is $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a small advantage, but I think I deserve a bigger share. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll need to adjust my expectations.

I'll accept the offer, but I'll make sure to negotiate harder in the next round.
