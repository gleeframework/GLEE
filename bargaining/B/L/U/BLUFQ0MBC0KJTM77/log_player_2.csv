"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's divide fairly

# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm Bob, and I'm not happy with this offer! While it's a ""fair"" division in the sense of percentages, Alice gets significantly more money than me. Let's see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is fairer, given our respective inflation rates. Let's see if we can agree on this.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's find a middle ground 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I still prefer the 60/40 split, I recognize that Alice's offer is a step closer to that. Given the inflation, and the fact that I have to propose in the next round, I'd be better off accepting this."
