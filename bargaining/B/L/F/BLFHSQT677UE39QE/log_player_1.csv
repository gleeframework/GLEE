"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,

}

Round 2

Bob's offer:

# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 20% less than initially. In the first round, my gain was $6,000, which is worth 80% of its initial value now. So, in the second round, I should aim for a gain that is worth at least $4,800 (80% of $6,000).

Bob's offer is $4,000, which is worth 66.67% of its initial value, so it's less than what I was aiming for.
