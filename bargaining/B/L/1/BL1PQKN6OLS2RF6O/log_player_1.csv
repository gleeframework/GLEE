"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 400k and take 600k for myself.""
}

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering the money will be worth less for you in the next round. Let's end this now. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth less in the next round, I'd rather take the current offer. Here's my response:

```
