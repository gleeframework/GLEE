"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose to keep 900,000$ and give Bob 100,000$.  It's a good starting point, and hopefully he'll accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Bob is being quite greedy! I'll reject this offer and see if he's willing to negotiate a bit more fairly in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer slightly to 700,000 for me and 300,000 for Bob.  I hope this is more reasonable and he'll accept it before we both lose more money to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still being too greedy. Even though inflation is hitting hard, I'm not willing to settle for such an unfair division. I'll reject this offer and hope he comes around in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to try a slightly lower offer again, aiming for a 60/40 split in my favor.  It's a compromise considering inflation, and I hope Bob will finally see the value in reaching an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though inflation is biting, I'll accept this offer.  It's a 50/50 split, which is fairer than what Bob was proposing before.  I don't want to risk losing even more money with each passing round."
