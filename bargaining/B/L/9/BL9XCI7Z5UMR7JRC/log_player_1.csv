I'm going to start with a pretty generous offer to Bob. I figure this will make him more likely to accept, and we can both get a decent amount of money.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to take the $1000 now, I think I can do better.  Since the money loses value with each round,  I'm better off waiting and seeing if he's willing to negotiate.  It's clear he wants a lot of the money, but I don't think he'll keep rejecting offers for long."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm reducing my share a bit more to see if Bob is willing to compromise. I'm still aiming for a good amount, but I'm showing I'm willing to negotiate.  The pressure is on him now!"
