Round 2

{""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Your offer was a bit imbalanced. Let's be more realistic. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  This accounts for the time value of money - if we don't agree now, the pot shrinks for both of us.""}

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but a 60/40 split is still too far off. Let's split it 55/45, with me taking the slightly larger share. This offers a more equitable split while still acknowledging the time value of money.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
