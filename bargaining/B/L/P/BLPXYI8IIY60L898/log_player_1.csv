"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
```

I'm going to propose a very lopsided split in my favor.  Since Bob's money is worth less with each round, I figure he might be willing to accept even a small amount to avoid getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I'm not going to let him. I'm going to reject this offer and see what he proposes next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer slightly, but I still believe that I can get a good share. Bob is losing more value with each round, so I'm hoping he'll see that taking a smaller amount now is better than risking getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being very stubborn, but I'm not going to give in. I'm still confident that I can get a better deal. I'm going to reject this offer and see what he comes up with next."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm going to try to split the money evenly.  Since Bob's money is worth so much less now, I think a 50/50 split might be appealing to him.  It's a better outcome for him than getting nothing, and it avoids further rounds of negotiation."
