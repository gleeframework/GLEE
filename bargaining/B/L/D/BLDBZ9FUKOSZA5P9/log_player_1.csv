"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I'm not going to give away 80% of the money. This is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
