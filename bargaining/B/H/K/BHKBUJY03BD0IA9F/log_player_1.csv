I'm going to be greedy in the first round, aiming for a 90/10 split. Let's see if Bob takes it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob is being pretty bold with that offer! I'm not going to accept it, but I'll consider it for the next round. It's important to keep in mind that with each round, the money loses value, so we need to reach a compromise sooner rather than later."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but still aiming for a significant share. I'm hoping Bob will realize that with the ongoing inflation, the value of his gains is decreasing, and he'll be more willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still very lopsided.  I won't accept it, but I'm starting to get concerned about the inflation. It's time to make a more serious attempt to find a compromise."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm going for a 50/50 split this round. With inflation eating away at the value of our potential gains, it's time to find a solution where we both get a reasonable share. This seems like the most logical way to move forward."
