"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'm offering Bob 45% of the money and keeping 55% for myself. Since the money loses value over time, especially for Bob, I believe this is a reasonable starting offer. Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. This is a fair starting point. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nBob's offer is not acceptable to me. Although the money is losing value, I believe I can get a better deal than 40% of the original amount. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, taking into account the decreasing value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I need to consider the decreasing value of the money for both of us. Since Bob's money is worth 20% less and mine is worth 10% less than the original amount, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. I'll offer Bob a slightly larger share to account for the greater decrease in value he's experiencing, but still prioritize my own gain, given that the money is losing value for me as well. Let's see if Bob accepts this offer.\n{""alice_gain"": 520000, ""bob_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's be realistic""}\n\n###"
