Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than a 7:3 ratio. Let's start with a 50/50 split and see if we can negotiate from there. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
