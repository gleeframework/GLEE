Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly. This way, we both get a good share and can avoid the risk of inflation eating away at our gains in later rounds. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
