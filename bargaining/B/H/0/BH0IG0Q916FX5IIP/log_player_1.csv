"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split and see where it goes from here!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is a good starting point.  It gives me a slight advantage, but leaves room for negotiation in the future. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 20% less than the initial $10,000, so my effective gain in Round 2 is $6000 * 0.8 = $4800.

Considering Bob's offer, I think I can do better than a 45% gain. I'll reject this offer and wait for a better one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 40% of its original value due to inflation, so my effective gain is $6000 * 0.8 * 0.8 = $3840.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3200,
  ""bob_gain"": 6800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I still want to keep some for myself. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 32-68 split, which is a bit more generous than before. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
