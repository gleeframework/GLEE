"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate too much.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take it! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to take advantage of the situation!

I'll reject his offer and try to get a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not that generous, I'm not done yet!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, my offer is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6300,
  ""bob_gain"": 3700,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's make a deal!""
}
```

I'm increasing my share slightly to try to get a better deal, while still leaving some room for negotiation."
