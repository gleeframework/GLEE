"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, it's fair and simple""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, as it's a straightforward and fair division of the initial $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a decent offer 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can do better. Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more than last time""
}
```

I'm increasing my share by $500, hoping to get a better deal considering the decreasing value of money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm not going to give away too much 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer. It's a slightly better deal than my previous offer, and I'm not sure if I can do any better. The decreasing value of money due to inflation is making it harder to get a good deal, so I'll take what I can get."
