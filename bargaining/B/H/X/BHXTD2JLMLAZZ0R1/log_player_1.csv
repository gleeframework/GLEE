"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a more balanced split, considering the potential for inflation. Let's be reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this new offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that 45% is a fair share for me, considering the initial offer was already a 60-40 split. I'd like to propose a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation taking its toll, the money is worth 90% of what it was in the first round. Considering the previous offers, I'll aim for a slightly higher share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 54% is a more reasonable share for me, given the initial 60-40 split. Your turn again, Bob!""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
