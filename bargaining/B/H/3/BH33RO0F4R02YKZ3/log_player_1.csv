"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn to decide.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer. You get to go first, so I'm giving you a chance to catch up. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting twist!

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I need to adjust my thinking. Considering the reduced value of money, I think Bob's offer is actually quite generous.

I'll accept Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
