"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a decent amount to keep the game interesting!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $30 and keeping $70 for myself. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, a 50/50 split seems like the best option for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $50 is actually worth 20% less than the $70 I would have gotten in the first round, which is $56.

I'm not sure if I want to give up 50% of the remaining money, especially considering the inflation factor. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain of $40 (80% of the original $50) is worth 20% less than the $56 I would have gotten in the previous round, which is $44.80.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bigger share this time, but I still think I deserve a bit more.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $60 and keeping $40 for myself. Let's see if he accepts!"
