"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{

  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! I'm offering you 20% of the initial amount. Accept and we can end the game early.""

# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking its toll!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully. Splitting it 50/50 might be a good way to end the game quickly, but it's not the best outcome for me.

I'll reject this offer for now and see if I can do better in the next round.
