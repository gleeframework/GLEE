Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 38.75 
# Alice gain: 61.25

``` 

**Explanation:**

Although I would prefer a 50/50 split, in this scenario, accepting Alice's offer is the best choice.  Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  My gains are significantly reduced due to inflation (19% less than the initial round), making it unlikely I'll get a better deal in the future. 
* **Alice's Offer:**  While not ideal, Alice's offer still provides a decent amount, especially considering the inflation factor. 
* **Risk of Rejection:**  If I reject, there's no guarantee Alice will offer me a better deal in the next round.  She might even offer less.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer in this round maximizes my gains and mitigates the risk of further loss due to inflation."
