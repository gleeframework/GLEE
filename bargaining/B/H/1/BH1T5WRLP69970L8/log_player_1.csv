"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I propose we split the money with a 70/30 ratio in my favor. This might seem a bit lopsided, but remember, the value of money decreases by 10% with each round.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a fair 50/50 split. This ensures both parties receive an equal share without any risk of future inflation affecting our gains. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{
