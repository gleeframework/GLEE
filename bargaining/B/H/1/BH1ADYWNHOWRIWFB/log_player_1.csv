"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, but I'll give you a slight edge""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, but I'm leaving a decent chunk for Bob to make the game interesting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a fair split, let's end this 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

After considering Bob's offer, I decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not sure why Bob thinks this is a fair split, considering the inflation rates. If the money is worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I think I should get a slightly larger share to compensate for the difference. This offer doesn't take that into account, so I'll reject it and try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I think this is a more balanced split""
}
```

I've adjusted my offer to account for the inflation rates, giving myself a slightly larger share to compensate for the fact that the money is worth 5% less for me. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a more reasonable proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly larger share to make up for inflation 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is catching up!

After considering Bob's offer, I decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I appreciate Bob's attempt to make up for inflation, but I'm not convinced that this offer is enough. The money is worth 14.26% less for me and 27.1% less for Bob, and I think I should get an even larger share to compensate for the difference. This offer still seems a bit too generous for Bob, considering the inflation rates. I'll reject it and try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5800,
  ""bob_gain"": 4200,
  ""message"": ""Taking inflation into account, I think this is a more accurate split""
}
```

I've adjusted my offer to reflect the increasing inflation rates, giving myself an even larger share to compensate for the fact that the money is worth 14.26% less for me. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a more reasonable proposal, considering the current economic conditions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a larger share to make up for the difference in our previous rejections 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll!

After considering Bob's offer, I decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I think Bob is finally starting to understand the impact of inflation on our negotiations. With the money being worth 22.62% less for me and 40.95% less for Bob, I think this offer is a good compromise. I'm willing to accept the 60-40 split, as it's a more favorable outcome for me considering the current economic conditions. I'm hoping this will be the end of the negotiations!"
