"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can split the money fairly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share to try to get him to accept quickly, while I get the majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair split, but I think I can do better! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a toll on my potential earnings.

I'll have to decide whether to accept Bob's offer or reject it and try to negotiate further. Considering the decreasing value of money with each round, I'll aim to maximize my share while minimizing the risk of getting nothing.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to compensate for the lost value due to inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting any younger, Bob. Take it or leave it!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not getting any younger either! Let's make a better deal! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll on my potential earnings. I need to be careful not to let Bob get the better end of the deal.

However, considering the decreasing value of money, I'll have to think strategically. Since Bob is offering a higher share to me this round, I'll have to weigh the risks and benefits.
