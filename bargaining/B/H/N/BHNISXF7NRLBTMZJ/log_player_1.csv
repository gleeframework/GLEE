Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'll start by being generous and offering Bob $1. This is a high initial offer, hoping to secure the deal quickly and avoid any inflation risks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, I think it's wise to accept this offer.  Inflation is a real concern, and the next round might bring further losses. A 50/50 split is a fair compromise, and I don't want to risk getting a worse deal in the future."
