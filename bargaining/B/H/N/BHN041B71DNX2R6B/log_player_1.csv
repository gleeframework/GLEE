"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I receive $60 and Bob receives $40. This is a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point for our negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering I get to make the proposal this round. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, the new values are:

* Alice's gain: 40 * 0.9 = 36
* Bob's gain: 60 * 0.9 = 54

I don't think this is a good deal for me, considering I was initially offered 60 and now I'm being offered 36. I'd like to make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less again due to inflation, the new values are:

* Alice's gain: 36 * 0.9 = 32.4
* Bob's gain: 54 * 0.9 = 48.6

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and split it evenly this round!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping that Bob will accept and we can end the game."
