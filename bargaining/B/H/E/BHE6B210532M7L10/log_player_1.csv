"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}

I'm offering to take 80% of the $10,000, leaving Bob with $2,000. This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping to set the tone for the negotiations and get a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking its toll.

I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 5% less, I need to think about the actual value of the offer. If I accept this offer, I'll get $6,000 in today's dollars, but it's actually worth 95% of the original $6,000, so it's equivalent to $5,700.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, but I'll play it safe for now.
