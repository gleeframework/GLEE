I want to see if I can get a better deal for myself."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think this is a more equitable split, considering the potential for inflation. Let's move forward with this offer.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my turn to propose a more equitable split. Let's settle this before inflation eats away at the value. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
It's better to take what I can get at this point, as inflation is starting to bite."
