"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit too much in your favor. I propose a more balanced 55/45 split. This reflects the fact that inflation hurts me more, so I need a larger share to make it worthwhile. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
