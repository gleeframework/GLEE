"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40, which is a generous 40% of the total amount, and I'll take $60 for myself. My message is a friendly one, hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that. This is a more balanced split. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting Bob's gain, I'll have to reassess the offer.

Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the offer in terms of my own gain.

I'll accept Bob's offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```
I'll take $45, and Bob will take $55. It's a relatively balanced split, and I don't see any reason to reject it, especially since I'm not getting a better deal."
