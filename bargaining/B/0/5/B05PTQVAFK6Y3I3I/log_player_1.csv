"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}

I'm starting with a very favorable offer to me, as I have no information about how the inflation will affect Bob. I'm hoping he'll accept this deal to avoid the risk of getting a worse offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a more even split, accepting this offer ensures I gain something. Given the inflation and the possibility of getting nothing in the next round, taking 10% of the total is a better outcome."
