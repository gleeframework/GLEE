"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

I'm offering to take 70% of the $100, and Bob can take the remaining 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation, my gain of 40 in this round is actually worth less than my gain of 70 in the first round.

I'll decide to reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","With inflation, my gain is worth 36% of what it was in the first round (since 20% inflation twice is 40% total loss in value).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 36,
  ""bob_gain"": 64
}
```"
