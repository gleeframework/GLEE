"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start to our negotiations!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $10,000 and leaving Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have the smaller share, but I think this is a fairer split. 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll evaluate Bob's offer.

For me, the $2500 is now worth 95% of the original $6000 I could have gotten in the first round, which is $5700. For Bob, the $7500 is now worth 80% of the original $4000, which is $3200.

I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal, but I'll have to decide. I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the reduced value of money due to inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more for taking the risk of negotiating with you!""
}
```

In this offer, I'm aiming to get a slightly larger share, but still leaving a decent amount for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I've been generous enough. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the value of the money in this offer.

For me, the $4500 is now worth 95% of the original $6000, but due to the additional 14.26% reduction, it's actually worth 81.47% of the original $6000, which is approximately $4869. So, I'm getting a bit less than I initially proposed in round 3.

For Bob, the $5500 is now worth 80% of the original $4000, but due to the additional 48.8% reduction, it's actually worth 51.2% of the original $4000, which is approximately $2048.

Considering the reduced value of money, I think this offer is a bit more reasonable than the previous one. I'll accept this offer.
