"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a decent share.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70/30 split, giving me $70 and Bob $30."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were generous last round, I'll take a bit more this time. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gains, I need to be more careful with my decision.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to reject it. I think I can do better than a 60/40 split, especially considering the inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, and considering Bob's previous offer, I'll make a more aggressive proposal to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm not getting any younger, let's make a deal before I get desperate!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: It's getting late, let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is really kicking in!

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a reasonable proposal, especially since it's a 50/50 split. Given the significant decrease in the value of the money, I'll decide to accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
