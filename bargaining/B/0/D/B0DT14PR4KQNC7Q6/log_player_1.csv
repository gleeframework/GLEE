"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further""
}
```

This way, we both get $500,000, and we can end the game if Bob accepts."

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take the bigger share this time. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give up $200,000 compared to the initial offer. I'll wait for a better proposal from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer in Round 2 was 60/40, I'll try to counter with a similar offer, but with a slightly better split for me. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I'm not going to give up too much""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'll take a bigger share now. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm getting a bit concerned about the inflation rate...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give up $200,000 compared to the initial offer, and the value of Bob's share is decreasing rapidly due to inflation. I'll wait for a better proposal from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer in Round 4 was 70/30, I'll try to counter with an offer that's more in my favor. Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly bigger share, but I need something more reasonable""
}
