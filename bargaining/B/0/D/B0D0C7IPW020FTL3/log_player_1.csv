"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, as it's a fair and straightforward way to divide the money. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll have to be cautious about accepting a smaller share.

I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60/40, I'll try to negotiate a better deal for myself. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a bit more, but still a fair deal!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than the previous offer. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but it's still a decent deal, considering the inflation! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, Bob's share is worth significantly less than it was in the first round. I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

However, I'm not sure if I want to give up 20% of the original amount to Bob. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 70/30, I'll try to negotiate an even better deal for myself. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm not giving up that much more, it's time to meet in the middle!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, which is a more favorable deal for me than the previous offers. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting desperate, but I'll give you a small share to end this! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is getting more and more desperate as the rounds go on! With the significant inflation effect on Bob's share, I'm not sure if I want to give him such a large majority of the remaining money.

However, I do need to think about the fact that the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and I'm not getting any younger. I'll accept this offer, but I'm not happy about it.
