Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, I'm taking more 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting greedier, and while time is running out, I still have some leverage. Accepting 40 now would be a significant loss compared to what I could have gotten earlier. I need to push back firmly, but also show I'm willing to negotiate as the deadline approaches."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's be real, this is going nowhere. 50/50 is the only fair deal. Take it or leave it.""}"

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You should have taken one of my earlier offers, now it's getting worse for you 
# Bob gain: 38 
# Alice gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** This is a tough spot. Alice is clearly trying to wear me down, and the inflation is hurting. However, 38 is a terrible deal.  I need to show I'm willing to accept less, but not that little.  There's a chance Alice folds in the next round or two if she thinks I'm about to walk away."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""Okay, this is my final offer.  Take it and we both get something.  Reject it and we both lose.""}"
