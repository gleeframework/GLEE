"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'm willing to give you a little more since the money will depreciate faster for me. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I want to see if I can get a better deal for myself, knowing the money is depreciating faster for Alice."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I appreciate your generosity in the first round, Alice.  But I think we can both do better. This offer reflects the fact that the money is worth less to you than it is to me, so we can still both come out ahead.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need to get a better share than your last offer. This is closer to a fair split considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'm accepting this offer. Even though it's less than my previous offer, I'm concerned that Alice will continue to lower her offers.  The inflation is a factor too. I'm better off taking this deal before it gets worse."
