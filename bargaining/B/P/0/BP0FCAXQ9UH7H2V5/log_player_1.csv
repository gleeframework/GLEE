"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, it's a fair start""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. I'm framing it as a fair split, but I'm really trying to get the higher amount to maximize my gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair. Let's try this? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my $8,000 is now worth 95% of its original value, so it's equivalent to $7,600. Bob's $2,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, so it's equivalent to $1,800.

Considering the new offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think a 60/40 split is too skewed towards Bob, and I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my previous $8,000 is now worth 95% of its original value, so it's equivalent to $7,600, and then another 5% less, so it's equivalent to $7,280. I'll aim to get a higher share this round.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a better deal this time, but don't think it's the best you'll get""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,500 and keeping $7,500 for myself. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time. It's the fairest way forward, and we can both benefit. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my previous $8,000 is now worth 85.74% of its original value, so it's equivalent to $6,858.80. Bob's $2,000 is now worth 73% of its original value, so it's equivalent to $1,460.

Considering the new offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure why Bob is suggesting an even split now, considering he was offering a 60/40 split earlier. I think he might be trying to get a better deal by making it seem like a fair offer. I'd like to try to negotiate further to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my previous $8,000 is now worth 85.74% of its original value, so it's equivalent to $6,858.80, and then another 14.26% less, so it's equivalent to $5,906.51. I'll aim to get a higher share this round.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more for myself""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer."
