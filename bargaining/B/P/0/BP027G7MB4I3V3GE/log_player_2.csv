"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I take a bit more upfront since the inflation hits me harder. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm Bob, and I want to maximize my gains. This offer is fair in the short term, but the inflation hits Alice harder. I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better if we split the money more evenly.  While the inflation hits you harder, I'm sure we can find a solution that works for both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, the clock is ticking and that money is shrinking. This is my final offer - take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd still prefer a more even split, the inflation is seriously affecting both of us. Accepting this offer is the best way to ensure I get at least something from this deal."
