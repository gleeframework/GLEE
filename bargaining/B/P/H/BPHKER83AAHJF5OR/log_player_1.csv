"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a balanced division""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I get 60 dollars and Bob gets 40 dollars. I think this is a fair starting point, and it's a good way to begin our negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started with a 60/40 split, I'll try to adjust the odds in my favor 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't like the direction this is heading. Bob's offer is very one-sided, and I'm not willing to accept an 80-20 split. I think I can do better than that. I'll reject this offer and try to make a counteroffer that's more in my favor."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and try to find a more balanced split""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a more even division of the remaining $100. I think this is a fair compromise, and it's a good starting point for finding a mutually beneficial agreement."
