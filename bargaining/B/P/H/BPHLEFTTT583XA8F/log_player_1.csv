"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which seems fair to me. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 40-60 split, but I'll have to consider it. Since the money is worth 5% less, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll try to make a better offer this time. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems more reasonable considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the value of the money is dropping fast! I'm not thrilled about the 30-70 split, but I'll have to think carefully about it.

Since the money is worth even less than before, I'll have to prioritize getting as much as I can. Considering the reduced value, I'll take this offer.
