Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer, Alice. We both need to compromise, and this factors in the rapidly increasing inflation.

At this point, the inflation is significantly impacting my potential gains. Accepting Bob's offer of $475,000 is the safest option to ensure I receive a reasonable amount, even though it's less than I aimed for initially.
