"Round 1
Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your generosity, but I think I can do better. Let's split the difference.  Time is money, but I still have the advantage this round. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is closer to a reasonable split, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  The longer this goes on, the more I lose due to inflation. It's time to apply more pressure."
