"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This gives you a good chunk and saves us both from inflation. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. The current offer doesn't seem fair to me, and I'd like to propose a different division of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering the inflation, I think this is a more reasonable split.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the inflation is hurting us both, Bob. This offer is a compromise that still gives you a significant share. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer as well. Although inflation is reducing the value of the money for both of us, I believe Alice's offer still doesn't balance the loss fairly between us. I'll wait for the next round to try and negotiate a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 520000, ""alice_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""Considering the increasing impact of inflation, I think a larger share for me is reasonable since my loss is less severe than yours. This could be a good compromise.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer. It's crucial we settle now before inflation eats away at the value any further. This offer still gives you a substantial amount. 
# Bob gain: 460000 
# Alice gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on the value of the money, especially for Alice, and the risk of further devaluation, I believe this offer is the best compromise we can reach at this point. Accepting this division seems more prudent than risking further loss by proceeding to another round."
