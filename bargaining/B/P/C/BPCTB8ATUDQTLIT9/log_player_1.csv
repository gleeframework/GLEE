"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm starting with a relatively aggressive offer, but I'm willing to negotiate if Bob rejects it. I'll see how the inflation affects things in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer to keep a larger share, the inflation has already impacted the value of the money. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a 50/50 split, which is a fair outcome given the circumstances."
