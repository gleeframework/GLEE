Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your 50/50 isn't really 50/50 with inflation. I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 4100 
# Alice gain: 5900 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a tough decision, but with inflation eating away at my potential gains, I'm starting to get nervous.  Alice is unlikely to offer me anything better at this point, and I'm better off taking this offer than risking getting even less in later rounds."
