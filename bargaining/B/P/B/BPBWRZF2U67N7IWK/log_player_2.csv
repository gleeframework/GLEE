"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split it 60-40. It's a good deal! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 5% less for me in each subsequent round, I'd like to try to get a better deal before accepting.\n\nPlease let me know when it's my turn to make a proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer to Alice. Since the money is worth 5% less for me in this round, I'll try to get a slightly better deal.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 45-55 is a fairer split.""}\n\nPlease relay this offer to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bigger share. Let's do 58-42. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nThe offer is slightly better than the original, but considering the inflation, I'd like to try to get an even better deal. Let's proceed to the next round.\n\nPlease let me know when it's my turn to make another proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth even less for me now due to inflation, I'll try to get a slightly better deal.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think 48-52 is a more reasonable split.""}\n\nPlease relay this offer to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still think I deserve a bigger share. Considering the inflation, 57-43 is a good deal for you. 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation, which has reduced the value of the money I gain by 18.55%, I think accepting this offer is the best option. Further rounds would only decrease the value of my potential gain, making this offer relatively more attractive compared to the risk of getting less in real value later on."
