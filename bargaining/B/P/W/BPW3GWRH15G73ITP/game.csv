9000.0,1000.0,Let's start with a fair deal. I'll take 90% and you get 10%. We can negotiate further in the next rounds if you don't like this offer.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Your cut effectively decreases each round with inflation. I propose a more reasonable split, considering the future rounds.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
7000.0,3000.0,"I understand inflation is a factor, but your offer is too lopsided. Let's compromise: I'll take 70% and you get 30%. We still have time to work out a better deal if this doesn't suit you.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Time is running out, and our money is losing value. I'm aiming for a more balanced outcome. Let's settle this before the inflation hurts us both further.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
6000.0,4000.0,We're both losing money with each round. I'm willing to go down to 60% if you're willing to meet me halfway. Let's not let our stubbornness cost us more.,Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
4800.0,5200.0,"Alice, this is a serious offer.  The inflation is working against you more than me.  Let's be reasonable and split this fairly while it's still worthwhile.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"We're getting closer! I'm dropping down to 55%, but I need you to meet me halfway on this.  The longer we wait, the less we both get.",Alice,7,
