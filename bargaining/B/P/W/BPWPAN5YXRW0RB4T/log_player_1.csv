"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000} 
```

I'm going to start with a generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept it.  This way, I can secure a good portion of the money and minimize the risk of inflation eating away at my share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my initial proposal.  I'm not going to accept a deal where I get only 300,000, especially since the money is worth less now. I'm going to try and negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000} 
```

I'm going to adjust my offer slightly, offering Bob 200,000 instead of 100,000. This might be enough to incentivize him to accept, given the inflation that's occurred. I still want to secure the majority of the money, but I need to be more flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still not good enough. While the inflation is hurting him more, I'm still losing a significant amount of value.  I need to push for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000} 
```

I'm going to try one more time to get a deal.  This time I'm offering Bob 300,000, hoping that he will accept since the inflation is hitting him hard.  However, I need to ensure I still get a good portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to a 50/50 split, which is better than what he's been offering.  Even though the inflation is affecting me greatly, I'm going to accept his offer.  The risk of further rounds is too high, and I don't want to end up with nothing."
