  ""alice_gain"": 700000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a 55:45 split in my favor. While your offer was fair, I believe this is a more equitable distribution, especially considering the diminishing value of the money for you in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
