"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable and split the money. This offer is fair in my opinion -  I get a slightly bigger share since the value decreases for me over time. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Your offer was a little low for me. How about we meet in the middle?""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you want a larger share, but I need to factor in the decreasing value. This offer is a compromise. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""Time is running out, and the value is decreasing for both of us. This is my final offer.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. We both lose if this goes on much longer. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

At this point, the deal is better than waiting for future rounds where Alice is likely to offer even less. Accepting now secures a reasonable amount.
