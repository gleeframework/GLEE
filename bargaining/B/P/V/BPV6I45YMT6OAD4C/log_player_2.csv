"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being generous, Bob. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible offer! Alice is trying to take almost everything. The inflation rate isn't a huge factor yet, so I'm willing to gamble that I can get a much better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Alice. This is a fair split.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob. This is a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 600000 
# Alice gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice's offer is much better now. It's not ideal, but with the inflation working against her, it's a reasonable deal. Accepting ensures I get something, and it's better to secure a decent amount now than risk getting a worse offer later."
