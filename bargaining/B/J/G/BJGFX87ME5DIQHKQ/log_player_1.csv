"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you a decent amount, but I'm not giving away too much.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $70 and Bob gets $30. This is a fair split, but I'm not being too generous, so Bob should think carefully before accepting or rejecting this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that. Here's a fairer split.  Let's be reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the money I gain is worth 5% less, so I'll have to be more careful with my decision.

After considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with the 40% gain, considering the inflation effect. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, my offer for this round is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm proposing a slightly more favorable split for myself, but still trying to be reasonable."
