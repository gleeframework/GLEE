Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: That's a very cheeky offer, Alice! How about this: I take 70, you take 30.  The value will only decrease from here, so it's a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
