"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can split the remaining money evenly after this!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small amount, hoping he'll accept and we can quickly conclude the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, I'm willing to give you a decent share! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more careful with the inflation in mind.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Too little for me, I'll hold out for a better deal!""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with the 40% share, considering the money I'd gain is worth 5% less due to inflation. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher share this time. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""A fair split, considering the inflation. Let's wrap this up!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping a significant portion for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not being fair, I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal now 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is catching up, and my gains are decreasing rapidly. I'll have to be more cautious. Since Bob's offer is similar to the one I made in Round 3, I'll reject it again.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Still not enough for me, I'll wait for a better offer!""
}
```

I'm holding out for a better deal, considering the money I'd gain is now worth significantly less due to the cumulative inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation eating away at my potential gains, I'll have to be more aggressive in my proposal. Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 650000,
  ""bob_gain"": 350000,
  ""message"": ""This is my final offer, take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm pushing for a higher share, considering the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. This is my last chance to get a decent deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, but I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll, and my gains are dwindling rapidly. I'll have to swallow my pride and accept this offer, as it's likely my last chance to get any significant amount.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Fine, I'll take it. Better than walking away with nothing!""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer, hoping it's the best I can get under the circumstances."
