"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal! I take $70, you take $30. It's important to decide quickly, Bob, as the value decreases with each round. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","### Step 1: Determine the current value of the money after the first round.
Since the money is worth 5% less for me (Bob) with each passing round, and we are now in the second round, the total value of the money for me is 100 * 0.95 = $95.

### Step 2: Decide on a fair division considering the depreciation.
Given that the money depreciates for me but not for Alice, my offer should aim to compensate for this loss while still being reasonable enough for Alice to consider.

### Step 3: Formulate the offer.
I will offer a division that slightly favors me to compensate for the depreciation but remains fair. Let's propose that I take $55 (considering the depreciation, this would feel like more than half to me) and Alice takes $45.

### Step 4: Attach a persuasive message.
The message should emphasize the fairness of the offer and the benefits of accepting it sooner rather than later due to the depreciation factor.

### Step 5: Finalize the offer in the required JSON format.
The final answer is: {""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the depreciation, this is a fair offer. Let's settle now to avoid further loss.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable. This offer is better than your last, and the clock is ticking. Every round costs you money! 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","### Step 1: Evaluate the current offer from Alice.
Alice is offering me $35, and she takes $65. Considering the depreciation, the $35 offered is actually worth less due to the 9.75% decrease in value from the original amount for me.

### Step 2: Calculate the actual value of the offer after depreciation.
Given that with each round, the money is worth 5% less for me, after three rounds (including the initial round), the depreciation compounds. The actual value of the $35 offered would be 35 * 0.95^2 (since the first round's depreciation is already accounted for in the second round's offer, we only need to calculate the depreciation from the perspective of the original amount, but considering we're in the third round, it's two rounds of depreciation).

### Step 3: Determine if the offer is acceptable considering the depreciation and potential future losses.
Given the depreciation, the offer of $35 is actually worth less in real terms for me. However, the question remains whether holding out for another round would yield a better outcome, considering Alice might offer less due to the pressure of further depreciation on my end.

### Step 4: Decide on the best course of action.
Considering the pressure of further depreciation and the risk that Alice might not offer a significantly better deal in the next round, it might be prudent to accept the current offer to avoid further loss, even though it seems less favorable.

### Step 5: Formulate the response in the required JSON format.
The final answer is: {""decision"": ""accept""}"
