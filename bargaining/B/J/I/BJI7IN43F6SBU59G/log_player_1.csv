Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both be happy with this split. It's a little more fair for me, but we both get a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: Since the money is worth the same for me in this round as it was in the first round, but 20% less for Bob, I can try to negotiate for a better deal. Bob's offer of 40 for me and 60 for himself is less favorable to me than my initial offer. Given the inflation affecting Bob's gain, I might be able to push for a more advantageous split in the next round. Therefore, I decide to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round to make a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nSince the money is worth 20% less for Bob in each subsequent round, but remains the same value for me, I can use this to my advantage in negotiations. Given that Bob offered me 40 in the last round, and considering the devaluation of the money for him, I can try to offer him a slightly worse deal than before, while still appearing to compromise. Let's propose a division where I get slightly more than last time, but still offer Bob a considerable amount, acknowledging the decreasing value for him.\n\n###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the circumstances, this seems fair.""}"
