"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is a fairly standard 60-40 split, which is a common ratio in many business and financial negotiations. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finalize the division of the $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, so I need to adjust my expectations.

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a slightly better split for me than my initial offer. I'll accept it.
