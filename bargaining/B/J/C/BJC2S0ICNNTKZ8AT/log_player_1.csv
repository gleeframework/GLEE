I included a message suggesting that I'm being fair by taking a bit more since I made the first offer. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. Let's be reasonable. This offer benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money is worth less due to inflation, I need to consider the reduced value in my decision. With a 10% decrease in value for me and a 20% decrease for Bob, the actual values would be $4050 for me (4500 * 0.9) and $4400 for Bob (5500 * 0.8). Considering this, I still think I can get a better deal, so I will reject Bob's offer.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nIn this round, I'll consider the reduced value of the money due to inflation. Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. I'll propose a division of $5700 for myself and $4300 for Bob, taking into account the decreased value. My message to Bob will be: ""Considering the inflation, let's adjust our expectations. This offer is more realistic."" Here's my offer in JSON format:\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5700, ""bob_gain"": 4300, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, let's adjust our expectations.
