"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This is a generous offer, considering I'm offering Bob a significant portion of the money, but I'm still getting a slight majority."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual values are:

Alice gain: 50 * 0.8 = 40
Bob gain: 50 * 0.9 = 45

I'll reject this offer because I'd be getting less than I proposed in the first round, and I'm not sure if I'll get a better offer in the next round. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, so the actual values are:

Alice gain: 60 * 0.8 = 48
Bob gain: 40 * 0.9 = 36

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

This offer is slightly more favorable to me, but I'm still willing to compromise to get the game over."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation:

Alice gain: 45 * 0.516 (since 1 - 0.484 = 0.516) = 23.24
Bob gain: 55 * 0.727 (since 1 - 0.273 = 0.727) = 39.985

I'll accept this offer because the actual values are closer to the original proposal, and I'm not sure if I'll get a better offer in the next round.
