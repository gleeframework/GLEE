"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. The message is a bit of a challenge to see if Bob will accept the offer or not!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 60-40, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of my potential gain has decreased by 10% due to inflation.

I'll evaluate Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting the offer because I'd rather wait for a better deal. The 60-40 split is not favorable to me, and I'd like to try to negotiate for a better ratio."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself. The message is a friendly reminder that we're getting closer to the 50-50 mark, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this more balanced offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, Alice. Let's try 70-30. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of my potential gain has decreased significantly due to inflation.

I'll evaluate Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting the offer because the 70-30 split is still not favorable to me. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better ratio, especially considering the significant decrease in the value of my potential gain due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Getting closer, Bob! Meet me at 60-40!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. The message is a reminder that we're getting closer to the 60-40 split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this revised offer."
