"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, it's a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a more fair split, considering the inflation rate.  Let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation rate, I'd rather get a slightly larger share now than wait for a potentially smaller share in future rounds. I'll accept Bob's offer.
