My message to Bob is ""Let's split fairly"". I believe this is a reasonable offer, considering we are equal players in this game. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or proceed to the next round.\n\n###\n\nPlease relay this message to Bob and let me know his response."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split, considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI reject Bob's offer. Although the money is worth less due to inflation, I believe I can still get a better deal. In the next round, I'll make a counteroffer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money.\n\n###\n\nPlease let Bob know that I rejected his offer and wait for my next proposal."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 460000, ""bob_gain"": 540000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet in the middle""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I'll offer a division of $460,000 for myself and $540,000 for Bob. My message to Bob is ""Considering inflation, let's meet in the middle"". Since the value of the money is decreasing, I'm willing to compromise and meet Bob halfway. I hope this offer is more acceptable to him.\n\n###\n\nPlease relay this message to Bob and let me know his response.\n\n###\n\nNote: I've taken into account the decreasing value of the money and tried to find a middle ground that is fair for both of us."
