"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose a 90/10 split.  This gives me the majority of the money, but ensures Bob still gets something.  Hopefully, it's enough to convince him to accept in this first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I would prefer more money, I know that the inflation is hurting Bob's offer significantly.  This is a reasonable split considering the circumstances.  I will accept."
