"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This offer leaves us both with a significant gain, and ensures you get a reasonable amount now before inflation diminishes its value. 
# Bob gain: 50000 
# Alice gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting this offer as it seems highly unfair, with Alice taking the vast majority of the money. Given that inflation affects my share and not hers, I need a more balanced proposal to consider accepting, especially in the early rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I believe a more balanced split is necessary. This offer gives us both a substantial amount, but slightly more to you, acknowledging the inflation impact on my share.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic.  Your share is diminishing quickly with each round.  This offer still grants you a considerable amount, and it's wise to accept before it shrinks further. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nWhile Alice's point about my share diminishing is valid, accepting 30% of the original amount seems too low, especially considering we're only in the third round. The impact of inflation is significant, but I believe there's room for a more equitable division before the value drops further. I'll hold out for a better offer or try to negotiate a more favorable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Given the increasing impact of inflation on my share, I'm willing to compromise but still believe a 40-60 split is more reasonable than the last offer. This division gives you the larger share while considering the diminishing value on my end.""}"
