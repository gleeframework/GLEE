I'm going for a very aggressive opening.  Since Bob doesn't know about the inflation, I'm going to try and grab the lion's share.  Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I would love to continue with my aggressive strategy, Bob's offer is a fair split given the circumstances.  He's probably aware of the inflation and is using it to his advantage.  Accepting ensures we both get a decent amount."
