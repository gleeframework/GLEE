Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor, as I want to maximize my gain in the first round.  We'll see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best option for me. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** My gains are worth 20% less than in the first round, so the $900,000 I initially aimed for is now effectively worth $720,000.  
* **Bob's Advantage:** Bob is now receiving a much larger share, and his offer is still significantly better than if we were to continue. 
* **Potential for Further Loss:** If I reject this offer, there's a good chance Bob will continue to offer me an even smaller amount in the next round due to further inflation. 

This offer guarantees me $250,000, which is more than I would get if we continued and the value of the money decreased further."
