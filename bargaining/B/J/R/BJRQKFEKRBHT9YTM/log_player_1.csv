"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, 60-40 in my favor.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the money, which is $600,000, and Bob gets 40%, which is $400,000. My message is a friendly one, suggesting that we start with a fair split, but with a slight bias in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a small advantage, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I still gain $600,000, and the money is worth 5% less for Bob, so he gains $700,000 * 0.95 = $665,000.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I'm not getting enough money, and I think I can do better. I'm willing to take a risk and wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more.""
}
```

I'm reducing my share to 55% ($550,000) and Bob's share to 45% ($450,000). My message is a conciliatory one, suggesting that I'm willing to meet Bob halfway, but I still need a bit more money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give away too much 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I still gain $600,000, and the money is worth 14.26% less for Bob, so he gains $650,000 * 0.8547 = $555,395.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting this offer because it's a better deal than what I had in the previous rounds, and I think it's a fair compromise. I'm willing to take the $350,000 and end the game."
