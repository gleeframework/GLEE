"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. Take this generous offer and we can both enjoy the money. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Alice, that's not a reasonable starting point. I'm proposing a more equitable split. Let's avoid wasting time with unrealistic offers.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is ticking and that 10% inflation is eating away at your potential gains. This is my final offer - take it or leave it! 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing tough, but her offer is getting worse for me with each round. I need to show her I'm serious and willing to risk it for a better deal. Accepting now would mean losing out on a significant chunk of the initial amount."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. This is a fair offer considering the time pressure and inflation. I'm willing to negotiate, but your offers are getting unreasonable.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Pressure Point:**  I'm increasing the pressure by stating this is a fair offer considering the circumstances.
* **Concession (Slight):**  I'm lowering my demand slightly to show a willingness to negotiate, but not by much. I need to hold firm to signal I'm serious about a more equitable split.
* **Framing:** I'm framing her offers as unreasonable, subtly shifting the blame for the stalled negotiation. This might make her reconsider her approach."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm compromising here. This is a fair deal considering the inflation working against you. Let's close this out and both walk away with something. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to frame her offer as a compromise, but it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  The inflation is indeed working against me, but accepting this offer would mean losing over 60% of the potential value from round 1. I need to hold out hope for a better deal in the later rounds, even if it means taking a risk."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Alice, this back and forth is pointless.  I'm offering you more than you'd get in the later rounds even with inflation. Let's end this now and both benefit.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Midpoint Pressure:** I'm shifting my offer closer to the middle ground while still maintaining an advantage. This creates the impression of a final, reasonable offer.
* **Highlighting Inflation:** I'm explicitly reminding Alice about the inflation and how it's impacting the value of the deal for both of us. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** The message implies that this is a time-sensitive offer, pushing Alice to consider it more seriously."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  Take this offer, or I swear I'm going to start playing hardball.  This is your last chance! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting desperate, but I need to hold firm. Her threats are meaningless unless she's willing to risk getting $0. My offer in round 6 was reasonable, and I'm betting she'll be more willing to compromise as the rounds progress and the threat of getting nothing looms larger."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 525000, ""alice_gain"": 475000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's stop the threats and be smart. This offer benefits us both, especially considering the shrinking pot.  Take it before it's too late for both of us.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Retreat:** I'm slightly adjusting my offer from Round 6, making a small concession to show flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Ignoring the Threat:** I'm not acknowledging her ""hardball"" threat.  Engaging with it would only escalate the situation and potentially backfire.
* **Shared Risk Emphasis:** The message emphasizes that both of us lose if we don't reach an agreement, highlighting the risk Alice takes by continuing to play hardball. 
* **Time Pressure:** I'm reminding her again that time is running out, increasing the pressure for her to accept a deal."
