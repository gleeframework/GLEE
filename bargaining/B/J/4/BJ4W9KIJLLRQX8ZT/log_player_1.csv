"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This offer gives me a 60% share of the initial $10,000, which seems reasonable for the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced values due to inflation, Bob's offer is:

* Alice gain: $5000 (initially $5000, but now worth 95% of $5000 due to 5% inflation)
* Bob gain: $5000 (initially $5000, but now worth 80% of $5000 due to 20% inflation)

I'll accept this offer, as it seems like a fair split considering the reduced values.
