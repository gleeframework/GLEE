"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 45% and keep 55%""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 45% and keep 55% for myself. This is a fair offer considering you rejected my previous one, which was even more generous. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is sticking to his guns. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that I'm getting a good deal, especially since the money is worth less with each passing round. I'll try to do better next time."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
