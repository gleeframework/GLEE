Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're willing to meet in the middle, but I still think I deserve a bit more. Let's try to find a compromise that's closer to my initial offer. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is clearly trying to anchor the negotiations in her favor.  While a 60/40 split might be tempting, it's still early in the game and the impact of inflation will increase with each round.  I need to show Alice I'm serious about getting a better deal."
