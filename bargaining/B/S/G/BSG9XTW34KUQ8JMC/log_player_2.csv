"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I propose a 50/50 split of the $10,000. This seems like the fairest option to start.

# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5250, ""alice_gain"": 4750, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your starting point, but with inflation, I need a bit more to make it worthwhile.  How about a slightly adjusted split?""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see your point about inflation.  How about we meet in the middle with a split closer to the original but slightly favoring me to account for the devaluation? 
# Bob gain: 4875 
# Alice gain: 5125 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
