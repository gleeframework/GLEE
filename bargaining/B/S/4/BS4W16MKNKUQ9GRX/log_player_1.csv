"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

This is a pretty generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","My offer in Round 1 was 700,000 for me and 300,000 for Bob, and now Bob is offering me 600,000 and himself 400,000. This is a slightly lower offer for me, but I'm willing to accept it since I don't want to risk going to the next round and facing further inflation.
