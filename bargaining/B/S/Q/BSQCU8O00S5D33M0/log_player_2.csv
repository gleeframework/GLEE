"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I propose a 60/40 split. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. The 5% inflation penalty for me is less than the 10% penalty for Alice, so I have an advantage in waiting. Additionally, I think I can get a better deal than 40%. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that is slightly more favorable to me, considering the inflation penalty. Since Alice is more affected by inflation, she might be more willing to accept a deal that is less favorable to her to avoid further losses.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think 55/45 is a fairer split.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. This is my final offer, take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll think carefully about this offer. Considering the inflation, Alice's gain of 55 is actually worth less than it was in the first round. However, my gain of 45 is also worth less. Since Alice claims this is her final offer, I'm not sure if I can get a better deal by waiting.

Given the circumstances, I think accepting this offer might be the best option. I don't want to risk losing more value due to inflation, and Alice seems unwilling to budge further.
