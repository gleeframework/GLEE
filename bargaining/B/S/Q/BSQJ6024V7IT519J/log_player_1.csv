Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the reduced share, but I'm willing to negotiate.

I'll counter with a new offer:

{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""I'll take 350,000 and leave 650,000 for you. It's still a decent split, and I'm willing to compromise.""}

I'm trying to get a slightly better deal for myself while still being reasonable. Let's see if Bob accepts!"

# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more this round.

# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the money is really losing value fast! I'm not thrilled about the reduced share, but I'm willing to consider Bob's offer.

I'll think carefully and then respond:

{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""I'll accept your offer, but I'm not happy about it. I'll have to be more aggressive in the next round to get a better deal.""}

I'm accepting the offer, but I'm setting the stage for a more aggressive negotiation in the next round."
