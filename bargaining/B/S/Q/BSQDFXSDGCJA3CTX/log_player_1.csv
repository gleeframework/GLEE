I'm starting with a fairly generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a quick agreement. Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is very unfair. While I'm losing money due to inflation, he's getting a much worse deal. I'm hoping he realizes this and comes back with something more reasonable in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but still offering Bob a significant share. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I hope Bob will see it as such."
