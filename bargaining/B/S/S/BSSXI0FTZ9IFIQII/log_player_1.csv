"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose that Alice receives $900,000 and Bob receives $100,000. This seems like a fair starting point, as it gives Bob a small portion to consider, while still giving Alice the majority."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
``` 

I propose that Alice receives $700,000 and Bob receives $300,000.  Since Bob rejected my previous offer, I am willing to give him a larger portion, but I still need to ensure a reasonable share for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While the inflation has significantly impacted the value of the money I gain, accepting this offer ensures I receive something, unlike if I continue to reject and risk receiving nothing."
