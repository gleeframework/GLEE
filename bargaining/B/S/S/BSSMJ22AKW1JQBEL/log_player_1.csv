"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my first offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```
I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more careful with my proposals now.

I'll reject Bob's offer for round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```
I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a higher percentage for myself this time. Here's my offer for round 3:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```"
