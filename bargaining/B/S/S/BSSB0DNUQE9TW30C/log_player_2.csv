"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I propose we split the money 60/40, in my favor.  This way we both get a decent share, and we can avoid the risk of losing value due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think we can do better. Since we are playing with inflation, it's in our best interest to close the deal quickly. Let's flip the script from your initial proposal - 60/40 in my favor, and we can both get more before the money loses value.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire for a quick deal, but I'm not comfortable with the 60/40 split in your favor. I'm willing to compromise a bit further, but I need a better share than 40% given the inflation factor.  Let's split it 54/46, giving you a solid gain while also ensuring I receive a fair share before the money loses more value. 
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400
