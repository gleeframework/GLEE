Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's start fair. I propose we split the money 60/40, in my favor.  This way we both get a decent share, and we can avoid the risk of losing value due to inflation.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think we can do better. Since we are playing with inflation, it's in our best interest to close the deal quickly. Let's flip the script from your initial proposal - 60/40 in my favor, and we can both get more before the money loses value. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's split it 54/46, giving you a solid gain while also ensuring I receive a fair share before the money loses more value.""}
