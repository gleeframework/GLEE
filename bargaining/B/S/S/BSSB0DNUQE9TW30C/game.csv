4000.0,6000.0,"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think we can do better. Since we are playing with inflation, it's in our best interest to close the deal quickly. Let's flip the script from your initial proposal - 60/40 in my favor, and we can both get more before the money loses value.",Bob,2,

5400.0,4600.0,"Bob, I understand your desire for a quick deal, but I'm not comfortable with the 60/40 split in your favor. I'm willing to compromise a bit further, but I need a better share than 40% given the inflation factor.  Let's split it 54/46, giving you a solid gain while also ensuring I receive a fair share before the money loses more value.",Alice,3,
