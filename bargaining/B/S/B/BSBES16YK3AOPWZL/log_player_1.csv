"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. It's a good starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can avoid further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me, I'll have to adjust my expectations. Bob's offer is now worth less to me than it was in the first round.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
