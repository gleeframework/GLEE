"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

This is my first offer. I'm aiming for a large portion of the money, but I'm also trying to be fair by giving Bob something. I'm hoping he'll accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still quite high for him, and I'm not sure he'll be able to get that much in the next round. I think I can do better."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly from the first round, acknowledging the inflation. I'm still aiming for a larger share, but I believe this is a fair offer that Bob might accept, especially considering the decreasing value of his share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting this offer. The inflation is starting to hurt and I don't want to risk getting nothing. 5000 is a decent amount, and Bob is likely to push for an even larger portion of the pie in the next round."
