"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose a 90/10 split, keeping 900,000 for myself and giving 100,000 to Bob.  This gives me the majority of the money, but still allows Bob to get something.  I believe this is a fair starting point that gives both of us a chance to benefit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
