"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split in my favor, but I'm leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than a 20/80 split. This offer gives us a more even distribution, and we both still get a good share of the money. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it for a moment...

I'd like to reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think I can do better than a 45-55 split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. 50/50 split. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive and aim for a 50/50 split."
