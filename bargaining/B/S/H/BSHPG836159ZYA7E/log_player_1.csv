Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is taking a big toll on your share. This might be the last decent offer you'll get. Consider it carefully. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 6 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:**  The inflation rate is severely cutting into my potential gains. Each round I wait means less money for me even if I get a slightly better split in a future round.
* **Bob's Strategy:** Bob knows the inflation is working in his favor and is likely to keep pushing for a larger share with every round I reject.
* **Diminishing Returns:** The difference between Bob's current offer and a potentially slightly better offer in later rounds is not worth the risk of getting even less due to inflation. 

Accepting the 4000 USD (while not ideal) ensures I at least receive something substantial before inflation erodes the value further."
