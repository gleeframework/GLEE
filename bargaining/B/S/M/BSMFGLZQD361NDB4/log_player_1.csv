"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and equal division of the $10,000. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or propose a new division."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer. You can't beat this! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my decision accordingly.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than a 60/40 split. I'll wait for his next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob due to inflation, I'll aim for a slightly better split. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going all the way to 60/40. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42/58 split, which I think is a fair compromise. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or propose a new division."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer. You're getting closer, but I'm not done yet! 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth even less now, so I'll have to be careful. However, Bob's offer is still a bit too skewed towards his side, considering the inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than a 35/65 split. I'll wait for his next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is getting even scarcer! With the reduced value, I'll aim for an even better split. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3800,
  ""bob_gain"": 6200,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting closer to my target. Can you meet me in the middle?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 38/62 split, which I think is a fair compromise given the current value of the money. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or propose a new division."
