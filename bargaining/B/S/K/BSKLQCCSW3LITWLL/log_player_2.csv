"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal, Bob. I take $70, you take $30. It's a good offer for you in the first round.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic.  This is round 3 and the value is dropping fast, especially for you. I'll take $65, you get $35.  It's better than what you'll get if we wait any longer. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is still trying to take a significant advantage of the situation. While the offer is slightly better than her first, waiting a bit longer might push her to offer a more balanced deal. The rate of inflation is hurting me more, but holding out a bit longer is worth the risk at this stage."
