Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8500, ""bob_gain"": 1500}

I'm increasing my share slightly to 85% as I'm aware of the inflation affecting the value of my potential gains. I'm still aiming for a relatively quick agreement, but I'll be more assertive in my offers from here on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is a significant improvement from his previous one, it's still not enough for me to accept. The inflation is starting to take a toll, and I'm determined to get a larger share. I'll continue negotiating to try and secure a better deal."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7500, ""bob_gain"": 2500}

I'm further reducing my share to 75% but I believe this is a fair offer considering the inflation and the remaining rounds. I'm aiming to secure an agreement before the inflation significantly impacts my gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Bob's offer is still too low for me to accept. Despite the inflation, I'm confident I can secure a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  I'm aware of the diminishing value of the money with each round, but I'm not willing to settle for such a small share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}

I'm willing to compromise further by offering a 70/30 split in my favor. We're now getting close to the end of the rounds, so I hope this offer is acceptable to Bob."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is still not high enough. I know the inflation is affecting the value of the money, but I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to try and get a better deal. I'm confident I can secure a larger share with a bit more negotiation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500}

I'm reducing my share slightly again, but I'm still aiming for a fair deal. We are running out of rounds, and the inflation is impacting both of us significantly. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and avoid the risk of getting nothing."
