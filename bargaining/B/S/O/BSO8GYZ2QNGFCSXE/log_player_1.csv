"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split, giving myself 900,000 and Bob 100,000. This is a fair starting point, considering I'll be taking on more risk if he rejects the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the most strategic move. If I reject, I'm risking the chance of getting nothing in the end, and the value of the money will continue to decrease. A 50/50 split is a reasonable outcome, and ensures that both of us receive a significant portion of the available funds."
