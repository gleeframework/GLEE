"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer gives me a slight advantage considering the inflation rate, but it's a good deal for both of us to settle quickly. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I understand the inflation puts you at a disadvantage, Alice. Let's be reasonable. This offer accounts for the time pressure we both face.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's not waste any more time. This offer is still favorable considering the inflation, and it's better than what we'll both get if this drags on. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the deal is getting worse due to inflation, accepting this offer would still give Alice a much larger share.  It's better to hold out and counter-offer, pushing for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. Let's end this now with a perfectly fair 50/50 split.  Any more delays and we both lose out significantly.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be reasonable, but I need to account for the inflation. This is my final offer, take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

The game has reached a critical point.  While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical decision for the following reasons:

* **Inflation:**  The value of the money is decreasing rapidly. Every round that passes significantly diminishes our potential gains.
* **Alice's Stance:** Her language suggests she's unwilling to negotiate further. Rejecting this offer significantly increases the risk of walking away with nothing. 
* **Time Pressure:** Only 7 rounds remain. Holding out hope for a better deal in later rounds is very risky at this stage.

While a 45/55 split isn't perfect, it's better to secure a reasonable sum now than risk losing everything to inflation and a stalemate."
