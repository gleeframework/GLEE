Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out and the value is decreasing. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000

""alice_gain"": 400000,

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm meeting you in the middle from my previous offer.  Let's end this before we both lose more. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in Round 5 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:** The longer the game goes on, the less value the money holds for both of us, especially for me with the 20% inflation hit per round.
* **Better Than Later Offers:** If I reject this offer, Alice is likely to offer even less in subsequent rounds, pushing closer to a 50/50 split which will be worth significantly less than 400,000 now.
* **Risk of Losing it All:**  If we don't reach an agreement in 12 rounds, we both get nothing. Accepting now avoids that worst-case scenario.

While I could gamble on Alice being desperate enough to offer a better deal in later rounds, the risk outweighs the potential reward at this stage."
