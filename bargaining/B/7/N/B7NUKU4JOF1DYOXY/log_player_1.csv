"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the $1,000,000 and Bob gets 20%. This is a generous offer, but I'm hoping to get a good chunk of the money upfront!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 780000 
# Bob gain: 220000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a toll!

I'll think carefully about Bob's offer...

After considering the offer, I decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me 78% of the money, especially since it's worth 5% less than it was in the first round. I'm hoping to do better in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the $1,000,000 and Bob gets 30%. This offer is a bit more aggressive than the previous one, but I'm hoping to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth less due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a bite out of the money now!

I'll think carefully about Bob's offer...

After considering the offer, I decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm willing to accept an offer that gives me 45% of the money, especially since it's worth significantly less than it was in the first round. I'm not sure if I'll get a better offer in the next round, and I don't want to risk losing out on any money due to the high inflation rate."
