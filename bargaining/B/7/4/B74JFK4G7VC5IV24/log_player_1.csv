"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40. A fair start, I think.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll try to meet you in the middle 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but 45/55 is a fair deal considering inflation.""}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I'm not ready to give up 10 yet 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would prefer a better offer, I'm losing value with each round. Accepting this guarantees me some money, and with the inflation, the next round might be even worse."
