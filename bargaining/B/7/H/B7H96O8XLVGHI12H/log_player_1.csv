"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 

This offer gives me the vast majority of the money, knowing that Bob will lose 5% of his share each round, so he's likely to accept even a very small portion to avoid losing more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
This is a fair split and better than the 5% I'd get if I reject.  It's likely in my best interest to take what I can get."
