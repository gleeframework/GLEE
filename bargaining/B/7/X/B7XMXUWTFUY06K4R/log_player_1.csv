"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. I'm hoping this is a reasonable starting point for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I can do better than that! You can get more, but you have to make a better offer next time! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my $6,000 from the previous round is now worth $5,700.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject it. Since I'll be gaining $3,000, which is worth $2,850 after inflation, I'll have to think carefully.

I'll reject the offer for now, hoping to do better next time.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, my $5,700 from the previous round is now worth $5,425 (5% less).

I'll make a new offer to Bob:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving up too much!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $5,800, which is worth $5,514 after inflation, and keeping $4,200 for myself, which is worth $4,011 after inflation. Let's see if Bob accepts this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle! This is my final offer, take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is catching up!

Considering the effects, my $4,011 from the previous round is now worth $3,462 (14.26% less).

Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, which is a reasonable compromise. Since my gain of $5,000 is worth $4,321 after inflation, I think this is a fair deal.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
