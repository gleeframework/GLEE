"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the original $1,000,000 and leaving Bob with 40%. This is a relatively generous offer, considering the game is just starting and we have no information about each other's preferences."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's only fair that we split the money evenly. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting that Bob thinks it's fair to give himself a 60% share!

Considering the inflation, the actual values are:

* My gain: 400,000 * 0.95 = 380,000 (5% less than the original 400,000)
* Bob's gain: 600,000 * 0.8 = 480,000 (20% less than the original 600,000)

I'm not convinced by Bob's ""fair"" argument, and I think I can do better. I'll reject this offer and propose a new one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not convinced by your 'fair' argument. I'll make a new offer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, my gain is worth 5% less than in the previous round, and Bob's gain is worth 20% less than in the previous round. So, the actual values are:

* My gain: 380,000 * 0.95 = 361,000
* Bob's gain: 480,000 * 0.8 = 384,000

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bit more.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 45% of the original $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 55%."
