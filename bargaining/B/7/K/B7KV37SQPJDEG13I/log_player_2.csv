Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said it was your final offer, but I'm not buying it 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage. While the offer is getting closer to something reasonable, accepting now would mean I lose almost 60% of the potential gain compared to the first round.  It's a gamble, but I'm hoping she'll become more agreeable as the rounds progress and the risk of getting $0 increases for her."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's be realistic, Alice. This is a fair deal before we both lose out.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

- **Time Pressure:** With only 7 rounds remaining, the pressure is on both players.  
- **Diminishing Returns:**  Every round that passes makes the potential gains less appealing for me.
- **Fairness Appeal:** Offering a 50/50 split emphasizes fairness and might sway Alice, who seems to be aiming for a slightly higher share. 
- **Urgency:** The message stresses the need for a realistic agreement before we both end up with nothing."
