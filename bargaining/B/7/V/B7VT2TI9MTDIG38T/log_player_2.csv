Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your attempt to be fair, but 60/40 is too much in your favor.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a 70/30 split.  This ensures we both get a decent share, especially as inflation continues to erode the value of the money.

# Alice gain: 700000
