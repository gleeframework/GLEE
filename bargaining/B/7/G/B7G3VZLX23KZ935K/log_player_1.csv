"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This means I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000 and leave Bob with 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my share is now worth 20% less, so I need to consider that when evaluating the offer.

My current share would be worth 80% of 7000, which is 5600, and Bob's share would be worth 3000.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
