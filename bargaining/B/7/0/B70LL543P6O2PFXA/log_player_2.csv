"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I get $6000, you get $4000.  It's in your best interest to settle early, as the value decreases faster for you. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 20% less for me with each passing round, I'd like to try to get a better deal. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'd like to propose a more even split. Since the value decreases faster for me, I think this is a fair offer. Let's settle before it's too late!""}\n\n###\n\nI've made an offer that gives me a bit more than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves her with a significant amount. I've also included a message to try to persuade her to accept, emphasizing the fact that the value decreases faster for me and that settling early would be beneficial for both of us. Let's see how she responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic.  The longer this takes, the less we both get.  I'm offering you a good deal here, considering the time pressure. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlthough the offer is relatively similar to the previous ones, I'd like to try to get a better deal. Since the money is worth 36% less for me than in the first round, I'm willing to take a risk and proceed to the next round to see if I can get a more favorable offer.\n\n###\n\nLet's continue the game and see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""I understand the time pressure, but I'm not willing to settle for less than this. The value is decreasing rapidly for me, so I need a better deal to make it worthwhile. Let's try to find a mutually beneficial agreement!""}\n\n###\n\nI've made an offer that gives me a bit more than before, while still leaving Alice with a significant amount. My message emphasizes the time pressure and the fact that I need a better deal due to the rapid decrease in value for me. I'm hoping Alice will understand my position and be willing to accept this offer or make a more favorable counteroffer. Let's see how she responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. We're both losing money by being stubborn. I'm making a final offer - take it or leave it. This is as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob gain: 4700 
# Alice gain: 5300 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant decrease in value for me (59.04% less than the first round) and Alice's message stating that this is her final offer, I think it's time to accept the deal. While I had hoped to get a better offer, the risk of proceeding to the next round and potentially getting nothing is too high. I'll take the 4700, which is still a significant amount, and end the game here."
