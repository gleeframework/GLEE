"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, where I take 60 dollars and Bob takes 40 dollars. I think this is a fair starting point, and I hope Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the inflation, but I'll consider Bob's offer.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I think meeting in the middle is a reasonable compromise, and I'm willing to take 50 dollars and Bob can take 50 dollars."
