"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $100, which is $40. I'm keeping 60% for myself, which is $60. My message to Bob is a friendly one, suggesting a fair and balanced split to start the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try for a more balanced split 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 20% less than the initial $60, so I'll get $48 in Round 2.

Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, which is a more balanced split than my initial offer. I'll consider it. I'll accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
