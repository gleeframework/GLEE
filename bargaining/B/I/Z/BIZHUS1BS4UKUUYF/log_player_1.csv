I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. It's a fair starting point, and I'm hoping for a quick resolution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I still think a 55/45 split in my favor is a fair deal, considering the inflation."
