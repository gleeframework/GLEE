"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate too much""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $100, leaving Bob with 40%. I'm framing it as a fair split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, let's take a bit more for myself this time 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my potential gain is now worth 5% less than before, so I need to be more cautious. Bob's offer is even more skewed in his favor, but I don't want to risk going to the next round and losing even more value.

I'll accept this offer, hoping to salvage what I can.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
