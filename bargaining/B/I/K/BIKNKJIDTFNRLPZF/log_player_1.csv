"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose taking almost all the money for myself, leaving Bob with just $1. I figure he'll accept this, as it's better than getting nothing if he rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
