"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take the lion's share, but you get something to start with. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not satisfied with only getting 10% of the total amount. I think I can get a better deal in the next round. Let's proceed!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it in a more reasonable way, considering the inflation, I'm already losing value.""}\n\nSince the money is worth 10% less for me with each passing round, I want to make a more substantial offer to myself to make up for the loss. I believe 60% is a fairer share, and Alice still gets a considerable amount."
