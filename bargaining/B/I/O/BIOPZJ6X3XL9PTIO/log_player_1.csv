"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""I'll start with a fair offer. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $9,000 and Bob gets $1,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take it or leave it. I'm not budging. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 10% less, so I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully... Since I won't be able to increase my gain in future rounds due to inflation, I should aim to maximize my share now.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
