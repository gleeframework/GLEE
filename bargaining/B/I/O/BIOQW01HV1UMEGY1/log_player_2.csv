"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  We can negotiate further if you'd like. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think we can do better than 60/40. How about 55/45 in my favor?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest. Let's end this negotiation and both get what we deserve. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","### Step 1: Consider the impact of inflation on Alice's gain.
In round 3, the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. This means if she gets $50, its value to her is actually $50 * (1 - 0.36) = $32.

### Step 2: Evaluate the offer based on the adjusted values.
Considering the inflation, the offer is effectively $50 for me (Bob) and $32 for Alice.

### Step 3: Compare the offer to the previous proposals.
In the previous rounds, the offers were not as favorable to me as this one, considering the impact of inflation on Alice's gain.

### Step 4: Decide whether to accept or reject the offer.
Given the adjusted value of Alice's gain and the fact that the money's value for me remains unchanged, this offer seems more favorable to me than the previous ones. Accepting this offer would secure a better deal for me compared to the previous proposals.

The final answer is: {""decision"": ""accept""}"
