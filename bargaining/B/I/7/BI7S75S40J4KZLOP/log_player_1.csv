Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better.  This offer is more fair, and we both get more money than in the last round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

Let's analyze Bob's offer. While he claims it's more fair and we both get more, that's not entirely accurate after inflation. He's aiming to take the bigger share, and with the inflation working more in my favor, I believe I can negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6500,
""bob_gain"": 3500,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. The inflation hurts you more than me. This offer ensures a good deal for both of us considering time is running out.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle. The inflation is hurting us both, so this is the fairest option now. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:**  The inflation is significantly eroding Bob's potential gains each round, making him more agreeable to a fair deal. However, it's also impacting my own potential gains, albeit at a slower rate.
* **Time Pressure:** With each passing round, the value of the money diminishes. Holding out for a significantly better offer in later rounds is risky, as we both lose out if we fail to reach an agreement. 
* **Fairness:** A 50/50 split, while not maximizing my potential gain, is undeniably fair. Accepting this offer avoids the risk of a less favorable outcome in later rounds, especially as the pressure increases."
