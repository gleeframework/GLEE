I'm going to start with a very generous offer, hoping to secure the money quickly and avoid inflation.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my initial offer, even considering the inflation. I'm going to reject and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with a more balanced split. I'll aim for 7000, taking into account the inflation that has occurred. Hopefully, this will be more appealing to Bob and we can finally settle this."
