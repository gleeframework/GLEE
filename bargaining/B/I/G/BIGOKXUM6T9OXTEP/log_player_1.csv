"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money in a 3:2 ratio. This ensures a fair share while considering the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the value of money is decreasing for me with each round. This ensures a better outcome for both of us in the long run. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
