"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money, Bob. A 60/40 split seems fair to me. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI think 40\\\/60 is not a fair split. I want a bigger share.\n\n###\n\nYour turn, Alice!\n\n###\n\nPlease respond with Alice's next offer.\n\n###\n\n(Remember, the money is worth 5\\% less in the next round!)"

Round 3

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. We're losing money with each round. A 50/50 split is the fairest option now. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI think a 50\\\/50 split is fair, considering the money is worth less now. Let's stop losing value and settle on this.\n\n###\n\nGame over!\n\n###\n\nThanks for playing!\n\n###\n\nWould you like to play again?"
