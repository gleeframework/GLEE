"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's fair in this round, with inflation, Alice will be getting much more by the end, while my share will remain the same.  I'll try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is more equitable, considering the inflation factor.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, I'll compromise, but still want the bigger share 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I'd prefer a more even split, Alice's offer is better than my last one, and the inflation will hurt her more than me in the next round. It's a good compromise."
