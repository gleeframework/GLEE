"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal. This offer won't be as good for me later. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd rather try to get a better deal than accept 10% of the total amount right away. Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering the inflation""}\n\n###\n\nSince Alice's money is worth 10% less with each passing round, I'm hoping she'll be more willing to compromise and accept a deal that's closer to 50/50. Meeting in the middle seems like a reasonable proposal, and the message should appeal to Alice's sense of fairness."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer, Bob.  I need to act fast to beat inflation. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlthough Alice is trying to create a sense of urgency with her message, I still think I can get a better deal. Since the money is worth the same to me but 19% less to Alice, I'm in a stronger negotiating position. I'll reject this offer and try to get an even better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Considering the significant inflation impact on your end, I think this is a fair adjustment""}\n\n###\n\nGiven that the money is now worth 19% less to Alice, I'm going to make a bolder proposal that favors me more. By framing it as a ""fair adjustment"" due to inflation, I'm hoping Alice will see it as a reasonable offer and be more likely to accept."
