Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the significant inflation impact on your end, I think this is a fair adjustment 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 

Taking anything less at this stage would be a significant loss for me. While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer cuts my losses with the ongoing inflation."
