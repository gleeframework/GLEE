"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, considering the inflation penalty you'll face if we delay. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob should reject this offer. While it seems fair at first, the inflation penalty will hit Bob hard in the later rounds. It's better to try and negotiate a more favorable deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split the money evenly. This way, we both get a fair share without having to worry about inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: My previous offer was better for you, considering the inflation. This one is slightly worse, but still better than what you'll get if we delay further. 
# Bob gain: 390000 
# Alice gain: 610000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob should still reject the offer. While the inflation penalty is kicking in, it's not yet significant enough to justify accepting a worse deal than the initial 400k offer.  Bob should continue to try and negotiate a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to increase my share slightly from the last round, but I need more than 400k to offset the inflation. This deal is still fair, considering the circumstances.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're trying to offset inflation, but every round it gets worse for you. I'm willing to make small concessions, but the bulk should still be mine. 
# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob should continue to reject Alice's offer.  The inflation is becoming a significant factor, but accepting a deal where he earns less than the initial 400k offer would be a mistake.  It's still possible to negotiate a better deal, and Bob should continue to advocate for his interests."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 430000, ""alice_gain"": 570000, ""message"": ""The inflation is hurting me more with every passing round.  I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share than last round, but I need to reach a compromise that considers the current state of things. This offer is reasonable given the circumstances.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is taking its toll on your share. I'm willing to make a deal, but my patience is wearing thin. This is a good offer, considering what's left. 
# Bob gain: 370000 
# Alice gain: 630000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob should reject the offer. Even though inflation is significantly affecting his earnings, he's still getting less than he would have initially agreed to in the first round. He's getting closer to a bad deal, but there are still rounds left where he can potentially negotiate a better outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 410000, ""alice_gain"": 590000, ""message"": ""I understand the inflation is impacting my share significantly, but I need a fairer deal than this. Let's meet in the middle.  This offer is still beneficial for you, while giving me a chance to recover some of my losses.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, and inflation is crippling your share. I'm willing to make one more small concession, but this is as good as it gets. 
# Bob gain: 360000 
# Alice gain: 640000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob should still reject the offer. Even though he is facing a huge inflation penalty, accepting this deal would mean he's getting significantly less than he was initially offered. There are still a few rounds left, and Bob should continue to try to negotiate a better split. He might be able to get a better offer by playing a bit more aggressively and highlighting the fact that he's still willing to take a hit due to inflation, but only if the deal is fair."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 390000, ""alice_gain"": 610000, ""message"": ""Inflation is hitting me hard, but I'm not willing to accept a deal that's worse than the initial offer. This is my final offer - I'll take a slight loss compared to last round, but I need a fair share to make this worthwhile. If we can't agree, we both lose.""}
