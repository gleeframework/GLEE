**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to pressure me with the time constraint and inflation, but her offers are consistently skewed in her favor. I need to remain firm to secure a better split, even if it means going down to the wire.  The closer we get to the final rounds, the more pressure will be on Alice to accept a less favorable deal."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. We're both losing out because of our stubbornness.  This is my final offer - take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is bluffing. Calling this her ""final offer"" is a tactic to try and force my hand. It's unlikely she wants to risk getting $0 in the final round. I need to call her bluff and hold out for a better offer, even if it's risky.  The inflation is hurting me more, but it's also cutting into her potential gains."
