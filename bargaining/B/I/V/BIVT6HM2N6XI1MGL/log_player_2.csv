"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair. I'll take 90% and you get 10%.  It's a good starting point! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a very uneven split! While getting something is better than nothing, I think I can negotiate for a much fairer outcome. Let's see what Alice offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""That's quite greedy, Alice! How about a more reasonable split? 60/40 seems fair to me."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 65/35.  It's a fairer deal than before. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is moving in the right direction, but that's still a significant difference.  Considering the time pressure and inflation, I'll aim for a more agreeable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
