"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still feeling generous, but let's split it 60/40. It's a much fairer offer than before, considering inflation. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than her first, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  The inflation is working strongly against her, making her more likely to accept a less lopsided deal in the next round. I believe I can still get a better outcome."
