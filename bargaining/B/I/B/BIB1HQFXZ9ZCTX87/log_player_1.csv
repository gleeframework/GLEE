"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can adjust from here""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be smart. I'm offering you a fair share, and we can both walk away with something. Remember, the money loses value each round, so let's not wait too long. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value quickly!

I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Considering the decreasing value of money, I'd rather take what I can get now. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer of $4,500."
