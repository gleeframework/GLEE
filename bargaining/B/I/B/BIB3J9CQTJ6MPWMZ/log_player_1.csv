"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 700000,
""bob_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer benefits us both.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Initial Offer:** Starting with a 70/30 split in my favor gives me a strong initial position.
* **Time Pressure:**  While the message sounds conciliatory, it subtly reminds Bob that time is a factor due to inflation. The longer he waits, the less appealing the overall pot becomes.
* **Future Rounds:**  If Bob rejects this offer, he'll be under pressure to propose something I find acceptable before inflation eats away at his potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want a larger share, but my offer is more equitable considering the inflation rates we face. Let's be realistic. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to leverage the inflation against me, but his offer is too skewed in his favor.  Here's why I'm rejecting and preparing for a counter-offer:

* **Unacceptable Shift:** Bob's offer drastically reduces my share while significantly increasing his. Even considering the inflation, this is not a reasonable compromise.
* **Leveraging Time:** While inflation hurts me more, it also puts pressure on Bob to secure a deal.  He loses value with each round, too.  
* **Counter-Offer Strategy:**  I need to propose an offer that acknowledges the inflation impact but still secures me a significantly larger portion than what Bob offered."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 620000,
""bob_gain"": 380000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's end this. I've factored in the inflation, and this is a fair deal for both of us.  Don't let time erode our potential gains further.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've reduced my initial ask by $80,000, acknowledging the inflation impact. However, my offer still secures me a larger share.
* **Pressure Point:**  The message emphasizes the shrinking pot due to inflation, putting pressure on Bob to accept before he loses more.
* **Balance:**  This offer aims for a balance between securing a good portion for myself and offering Bob a reasonable enough deal to avoid further rounds."
