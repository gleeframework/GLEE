I propose Alice gets $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000.  I figure it's a good starting point, giving Bob a small share to hopefully encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to try and counter Bob's offer, but I'm going to need to be careful. I'll propose $800,000 for myself and $200,000 for Bob. Since inflation is hurting me, I need to close the gap a bit more."
