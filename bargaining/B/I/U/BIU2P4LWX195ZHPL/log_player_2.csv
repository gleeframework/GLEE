**Reasoning:**

The clock is ticking, but Alice is clearly trying to wear me down. I need to hold my ground a bit longer and hope she makes a better offer soon. Accepting now would mean settling for significantly less than half the original value due to inflation."

# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is killing me! While this offer isn't ideal, it's better than risking getting nothing at all if we run out of rounds. Alice acknowledges the inflation but is clearly still trying to get a bigger share. Accepting now cuts my losses."
