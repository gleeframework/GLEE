"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 40% share, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already starting to bite!

I'm not thrilled with the offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth 5% less now, I'd rather accept this offer than risk waiting for a better one. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
