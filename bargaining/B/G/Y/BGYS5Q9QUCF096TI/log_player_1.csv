Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a very lopsided division, giving Bob only $1.  It's unlikely he'll accept this, but it sets a clear starting point for negotiation.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a fair offer, and it's unlikely I can get more.  Let's split the money evenly and end the game."
