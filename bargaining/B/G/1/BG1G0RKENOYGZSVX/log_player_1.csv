I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor, as I believe it's a fair starting point.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred a larger share,  I think it's in my best interest to accept this offer.  Given the inflation, the value of the money is decreasing for both of us, and rejecting this offer could result in a worse outcome for me in future rounds."
