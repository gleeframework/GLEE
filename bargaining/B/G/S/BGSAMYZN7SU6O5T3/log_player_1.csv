Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was quite generous, but I think my value is a bit higher. How about this split? It gives me a larger share, reflecting my risk in rejecting your initial offer, but still leaves you with a significant sum. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
