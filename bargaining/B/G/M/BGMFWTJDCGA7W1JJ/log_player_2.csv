"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous. Let's start with a fair split, but I'm willing to negotiate. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a very uneven split in Alice's favor. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm hoping for a much fairer outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""That offer was quite lopsided, Alice. How about a split that reflects our equal standing in this game? This offer is fair and leaves us both with a significant sum.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a bigger share to compensate for the inflation.  Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is taking advantage of the situation, but that's still not a fair split considering the money is losing value for her, not for me.  Let's see if she's willing to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Okay, Alice, let's meet closer to the middle. I understand the inflation is a factor, so I'm willing to take a slightly smaller portion to reach a fair deal. This offer considers the changing value and gives us both a reasonable outcome.""}
