I'm starting with a relatively aggressive offer, aiming to get a large portion of the money.  Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is terrible! I'm getting only $10, and even though the money is worth less, it's still a much better deal for him. I'll reject and see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm going to stick with a similar strategy, aiming for a high portion of the money, but slightly adjusting my offer to account for the inflation.  I'll aim for $80.  Bob might be getting desperate to get some money at this point."
