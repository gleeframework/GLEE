"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start to our negotiation.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted 50/50, I'll give you 60/40, but I'm not getting taken advantage of! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to negotiate a better deal for himself. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""60/40 is still not good enough, I want a better deal!""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and will wait for his next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60/40, I'll try to counter with a slightly better offer for myself. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give up too much!""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer or try to negotiate further!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not giving up enough, I'll take a smaller share, but I'm not going to give you all the power! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to find a sweet spot. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, I'll take the deal. 450,000 is a good compromise!""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer from Round 4. I think 450,000 is a fair amount, and I'm willing to end the game here."
