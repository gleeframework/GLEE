"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'll start with a generous offer, keeping 90% of the money for myself and giving Bob 10%.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, it's better to take what I can get before the inflation eats away at the value further."
