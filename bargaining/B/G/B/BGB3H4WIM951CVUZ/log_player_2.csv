"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a fair split, given that I'm taking a bigger risk with the inflation. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer seems generous at first glance, the inflation drastically reduces the value of the money over time. As Bob, I'm taking a larger hit from inflation, so I'll try to negotiate a better deal."
