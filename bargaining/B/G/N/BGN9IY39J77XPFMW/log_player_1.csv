"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a fair starting point, considering I'll be bearing the brunt of inflation at a higher rate than Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I accept Bob's offer. While I would have preferred more, the inflation rate makes it more beneficial to accept a 50/50 split than risk getting nothing."
