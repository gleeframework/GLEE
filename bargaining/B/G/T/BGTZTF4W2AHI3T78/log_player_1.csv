"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}

I'm going to start with a very unequal offer.  I figure Bob might be willing to accept anything, and even if not, the inflation effect could make it a lot more appealing to him in the next round.  Let's see what happens!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is fair, and while I might be able to get a slightly better deal in the next round, the risk of inflation is too high. It's a good deal for me, and I'm happy to take it."
