"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a very aggressive opening offer.  I want to secure almost all of the money, leaving Bob with a tiny amount.  Hopefully, he'll be tempted to take it rather than risk getting nothing in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd love to keep pushing for more, Bob's offer is a fair split. Accepting ensures I get half the money, which is a much better outcome than risking getting nothing due to inflation."
