"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can avoid the risk of inflation eating into our potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain is now worth 10% less than before, so I'm getting less than I initially offered. Bob's offer is still a 60-40 split, but now it's more favorable to him.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer that's more favorable to me. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This offer is a 55-45 split, which is a bit more in my favor than Bob's previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really eating into my potential gains! My offer from round 3 was already more favorable to me, but now Bob's offer is almost identical to the one I made in round 2.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains. I need to be more aggressive in my offer. Here's my next proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This offer is the same as my initial offer in round 1, but now it's even more favorable to me due to the increased inflation. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finally settle."
