"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 6:4 split in my favor. It's a fair trade for rejecting your initial proposal, and it allows us to get this done quickly. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
