**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, time is working against us more than her.  It's crucial to push for a better deal now before the inflation eats further into our potential gains. Another rejection might make her realize we're serious about getting a fairer share."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""This is a very fair offer, Alice.  We're running out of time, and the inflation is hurting both of us. Let's close this deal.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm pushing a bit more aggressively this round.  Alice might be trying to stall, hoping the increasing inflation will make me desperate enough to accept a worse offer. By offering 48-52, I'm signaling I'm willing to compromise, but I'm also making it clear that I understand the time pressure and the impact of inflation."
