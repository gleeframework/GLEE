"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept this and we can move on to the next round.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I receive $8,000 and Bob receives $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, it's a good starting point 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money, my gain of $5,000 is actually worth $4,750, and Bob's gain of $5,000 is worth $4,500.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with a 50/50 split, especially since the money is worth less with each passing round. I'd like to try to get a better deal.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money losing value at a faster rate for Bob, I think I can make a more attractive offer. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly higher share, Bob. Accept this and we can move on to the next round.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. This is my best offer so far. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money losing value at an even faster rate, I need to be careful. However, Bob's offer is getting closer to what I was initially offering, but with a slightly higher share for him.

Considering the rapidly decreasing value of the money, I think I can do better than this. I'd like to try to get a better deal.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money losing value at an even faster rate, I need to be more aggressive in my proposal. Here's my offer for Round 5:

```

  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not getting any younger, Bob. I need a bigger share to make this worth my while.""
}

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting a bit frustrated with these lowball offers. I think I deserve more, but I'm willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money losing value at an alarming rate, I need to be more cautious. Bob's offer is getting closer to what I was initially offering, but with a much higher share for him.

However, I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with giving him 70% of the remaining value. I'd like to try to get a better deal, but I'm running out of time.

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money losing value at an extremely rapid rate, I need to be more aggressive in my proposal. Here's my offer for Round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""This is my final offer, Bob. Take it or leave it. I'm not going to make any more concessions.""

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going to accept a 3:7 split. I think I deserve a better share, considering the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money losing value at an incredible rate, I'm starting to get desperate. Bob's offer is getting closer to what I was initially offering, but with a much higher share for him.

However, I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with giving him 80% of the remaining value. I'd like to try to get a better deal, but I'm running out of time.

But considering the rapid decline in value, I think I'll take a risk and accept this offer. It's not ideal, but it's better than getting nothing.
