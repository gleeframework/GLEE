"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While the offer seems fair on the surface, I know Alice's money is losing value faster than mine. I can get a better deal if I wait."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet in the middle of our previous offers 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is slowly moving towards a more even split, which benefits me. Her money is devaluing, so she'll be more desperate for a deal in the next round. I'm willing to gamble for a slightly better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Time is running out, Alice. This is a generous offer.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I won't go below this, inflation is costing me 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

It's risky to push Alice further, especially since she's put her foot down. Accepting this offer guarantees me a gain, and it's better than what I'd have gotten in Round 4.  The remaining rounds don't guarantee a better outcome, and I risk walking away with nothing."
