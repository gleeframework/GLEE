"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Let's split fairly, Bob. A little more for me to start since the value decreases faster for you.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice. A 50/50 split is the most straightforward. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While a 50/50 split seems fair on the surface, the inflation heavily favors me in later rounds. Bob's offer doesn't account for this advantage. I need to push for a better split while the money is still valuable to him."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Okay, Bob, let's meet in the middle. This factors in the decreasing value a bit.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The clock is ticking, Alice. I'm taking a small hit on the depreciation, but this is a fair deal. 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** This is tricky! While Bob's offer is closer to a ""fair"" split in terms of present value, it's still advantageous for me in the long run.  The rate of inflation is working in my favor.  I need to hold out a bit longer and see if I can secure a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5100,
""bob_gain"": 4900,
""message"": ""Bob, this is a compromise, taking the time pressure into account.  It's better for you to take a smaller loss now.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing the pressure on Bob. This offer is slightly better for me than his last, and the shrinking timeframe should make him more willing to negotiate.  I'm hoping this convinces him to settle before the value depreciates further for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're wasting valuable time. I'm taking another hit from the inflation, but this offer is more than generous. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is getting desperate and is willing to take a larger and larger hit from the inflation. It's likely this is the best offer I'll get. Accepting now guarantees me a good portion of the money, and it's better than risking getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
