"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40, which is 40% of the original $100. This is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, you can have a small share 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is affecting me more than Bob, it seems!

Considering the new offer, I'm not thrilled about giving up 80% of the remaining $100. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The game continues! Given the inflation, my offer will be worth even less than before. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 30,
  ""bob_gain"": 70,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a decent share, but I need something fair!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a larger share, but still keeping some for myself. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take most, you can have a tiny bit 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on me! Given the new offer, I'm not thrilled about getting only $10, considering the value of money has decreased significantly. However, I don't want to risk going to the next round and potentially losing even more value. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
