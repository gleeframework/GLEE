"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly!""}\n\n###\n\nLet me know what Bob decides! \n\n###\n\n(Also, just to clarify, the inflation rates are 5% for me and 10% for Bob, which means that with each passing round, the value of the money decreases by those percentages for each of us, correct?)"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time. Fair is fair! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nLet's see what happens next! \n\n###\n\n(I rejected the offer because, considering the inflation, accepting 50 in the second round is actually less valuable than what I initially offered to Bob in the first round. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round.)"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle?""}\n\n###\n\nLet me know what Bob decides! \n\n###\n\n(I'm trying to find a compromise, considering the inflation. This offer is slightly more favorable to me than the previous one, but still relatively fair.)"
