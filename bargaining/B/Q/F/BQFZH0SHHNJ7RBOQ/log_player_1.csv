"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 

This is a classic game theory scenario, and my strategy is to be as greedy as possible while still ensuring Bob will accept.  I'm offering him a tiny share, hoping he'll take it rather than risk getting nothing in future rounds due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer to get more than 50%, accepting this offer is the best strategy. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** I don't know how inflation will affect Bob's future offers. It's possible he'll become even more greedy.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  If I reject, I'm risking getting nothing. Even though I might get a slightly better deal in a later round, there's no guarantee.  
* **Fairness:**  This offer is fair, even though it's not ideal.  It's a good compromise that ensures we both get something."
