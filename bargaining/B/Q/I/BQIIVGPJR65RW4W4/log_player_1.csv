Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 400k and take the rest.""
}

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but you can do better than this! 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 95% of its original value, so I'll calculate my gain as $600,000 * 0.95 = $570,000.

Bob's offer is:

* Alice gain: $250,000
* Bob gain: $750,000

I'll reject this offer because it's not as good as my original offer, considering the inflation.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 95% of its original value, so I'll calculate my gain as $600,000 * 0.95^2 = $544,500.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,

# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation has taken a bigger hit this time!

Considering the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 85.74% of its original value, so I'll calculate my gain as $600,000 * 0.8574 = $515,44.
