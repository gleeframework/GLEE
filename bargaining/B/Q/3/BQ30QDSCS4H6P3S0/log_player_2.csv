I'm Bob, and I know there's inflation! I can do better than 50/50.  Let's see what Alice offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm taking advantage of the inflation, but still offering a fair share.  Let's end this now.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving away too much. Let's meet in the middle! 
# Bob gain: 580000 
# Alice gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll accept Alice's offer. Even with the inflation, this is a good deal for me.  Let's call it a day!"
