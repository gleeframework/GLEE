"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I'll get 6,000 and Bob will get 4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take it or leave it, I'm not budging! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this one...

Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly. Considering the offer, I'll get 3,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial proposal.

However, Bob's message ""Take it or leave it, I'm not budging!"" suggests that he's not willing to negotiate further. Given the reduced value of the money and Bob's firm stance, I'll decide to...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Time to make a new proposal!

Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll aim for a more balanced split. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, a compromise!""}

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, where I'll get 4,500 and Bob will get 5,500."
