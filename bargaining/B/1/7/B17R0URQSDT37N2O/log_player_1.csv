"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less, I'll consider the offer in terms of the original value.

If Bob's offer is 50% of the original $100, that's $50. But since the money is worth 20% less, I'd be getting $50 / 0.8 = $62.5 in terms of original value.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
