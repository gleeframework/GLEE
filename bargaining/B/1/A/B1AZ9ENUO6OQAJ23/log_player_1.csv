I propose to take $9,000 and give $1,000 to Bob. I'm hoping this will be a good starting point for negotiations."

Round 3

I'm willing to reduce my share slightly, but I'm still aiming for a significant portion of the money. This offer reflects the inflation that has occurred and should be more appealing to Bob."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to try and meet Bob halfway. Given the inflation and the limited rounds, I need to secure a decent amount for myself while also leaving some room for negotiation."

I'm still not convinced this is fair. We're getting very close to the deadline, and I'm willing to negotiate, but I need a better deal than this."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

With only a few rounds left, I'm trying to be more flexible.  I'm reducing my share again, but I'm still hoping for a fair outcome."

{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm starting to feel the pressure of the deadline, but I'm not willing to settle for such a small share.  We need to find a compromise that's fair for both of us."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

We're running out of time, and with the inflation rates, both of us are losing a lot of money.  I propose we split the money evenly.  It's not ideal, but it's the fairest solution at this point."
