"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the majority, but you get a good chunk too. Let's end this quickly. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see if we can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think a more even split is fairer. Let's avoid a lengthy negotiation and end this quickly.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's compromise. This time, I'll take a slightly smaller share, but I think it's fair considering you rejected my offer.  We can end this quickly if we agree. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
It's better to accept this offer and get something rather than risk getting nothing. The money is losing value rapidly and it's unlikely I'll get a better deal in the next few rounds."
