55.0,45.0,"Bob, I understand your point about the inflation, but 60/40 in your favor is too much. How about we meet in the middle at 55/45?",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
45.0,55.0,"I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 55/45, which is a fair compromise considering the inflation. We're both losing value with each round, so let's end this quickly.",Bob,4,

52.0,48.0,"Bob, we're running out of time.  I'm willing to go down to 52/48, but I need you to meet me closer to the middle. This is my final offer.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
48.0,52.0,I'm willing to meet you halfway at 52/48.  We're both losing money with every round. Let's settle this and avoid further losses.,Bob,6,
