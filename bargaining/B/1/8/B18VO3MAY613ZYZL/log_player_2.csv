"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly considering the inflation rates. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While this seems like a ""fair"" deal on the surface, the inflation heavily favors Alice. My money loses value faster. It's better to take a gamble on getting to propose in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm feeling generous, but let's make it snappy. Time is money, Alice!""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Taking Initiative:** I need to shift the power dynamic. By proposing first in this round, I set the stage for potential negotiation in my favor. 
* **Strategic Advantage:**  Alice's money is devaluing slower, so she might be more amenable to a slightly lower offer now than if we drag this out.
* **Urgency:** My message aims to subtly remind Alice that waiting benefits her more than it benefits me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the increasing loss in value, let's settle on this division to minimize further losses for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:** The inflation is eating into the potential gains significantly. Waiting any longer will likely result in a worse outcome for both of us.
* **Acceptable Offer:** While not ideal, Alice's offer is better than her initial proposal. It's close enough to my proposed split in Round 2 that accepting now makes sense, considering the inflation.
* **Risk Mitigation:**  Rejecting this offer risks Alice proposing an even less favorable deal in the next round, where the money will be worth even less."
