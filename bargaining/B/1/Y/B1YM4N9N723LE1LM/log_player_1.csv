"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, it's fair!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 evenly, with each of us getting $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about the 20% decrease in value of my share, and Bob's offer of $4,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'll compromise a bit, but I think this is a fairer split""}

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but still trying to get a better deal than the original proposal."

Round 4

# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm getting frustrated with the constant decrease in value of my share due to inflation. Bob's offer of $3,500 is still too low, and I'm not willing to accept a deal that's 48.8% less than the original offer. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
