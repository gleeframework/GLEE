"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This is a fairly standard 55-45 split, which I'm hoping Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gains, I need to adjust my strategy. Since Bob's offer is still a 40-60 split, but now with a larger difference in our gains, I'm going to try to negotiate a better deal for myself. I'll reject Bob's offer.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With inflation affecting my gains, I'll aim for a more balanced split this time. Here's my new offer:

  ""bob_gain"": 510000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gains even more, I need to be more cautious. Since Bob's offer is similar to my previous offer, but with a slightly better split for me, I'll consider it. However, I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll accept this offer.
