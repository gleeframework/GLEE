I'm starting with a very lopsided offer, hoping to get the most out of the deal right away.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting this offer.  Even though it's a lot more than the last round, I'm still hoping for a better deal!  I'll see if I can get a better split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm increasing my offer to 60, aiming for a more balanced split.  This should hopefully entice Bob to accept, given the decreasing value of the money for him."
