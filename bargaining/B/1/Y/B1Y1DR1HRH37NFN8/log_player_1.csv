"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

This offer gives me the majority of the money ($9,000), while still giving Bob a small amount ($1,000). It's a reasonable starting point, given the inflation risk, and it allows me to see if Bob is willing to accept a less-than-equal split in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation makes this offer increasingly more attractive. Accepting this offer guarantees me $6,000, which is better than risking further rounds and ending up with nothing."
