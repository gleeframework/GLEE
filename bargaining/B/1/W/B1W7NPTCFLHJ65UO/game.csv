,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Let's try 55% for me and 45% for you. I think this is a more reasonable split, considering I'm taking on the risk of inflation.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Let's be reasonable.  I'll take 50%, you take 50%. We can both get a fair share.  What do you say?",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Considering the inflation, I need a larger share to make up for the loss in value. I'm offering 60% for me and 40% for you. This way, I can mitigate the effect of inflation and still get a reasonable amount.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"I understand the inflation is affecting you, Bob. Let's split it 55/45, I'll take a slight cut to keep things moving.",Alice,5,

3000.0,7000.0,"Inflation is really eating into my share, so I need to adjust my offer accordingly. I'm proposing 70% for me and 30% for you. This might seem unfair, but I'm trying to make up for the significant loss in value due to inflation.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Bob, I'm willing to compromise further, but we need to find a middle ground.  Let's split it 45/55, I'll take a smaller share to avoid another stalemate.",Alice,7,

2000.0,8000.0,"Inflation is drastically reducing my share, and I'm running out of time. I'm proposing 80% for me and 20% for you. I know this seems extreme, but I'm trying to salvage what's left of the value.",Bob,8,

3500.0,6500.0,"Bob, we're getting close to the end.  I'm willing to take 35% and let you have 65% to avoid us both getting nothing.  It's not ideal, but it's better than zero.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
1000.0,9000.0,"We're running out of time, and I'm desperate to get something. I'm proposing 90% for me and 10% for you. I know this is an extreme offer, but I'm trying to get as much as possible considering the massive loss in value due to inflation.",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
2500.0,7500.0,"Bob, we're down to the wire. I'm willing to take a significant cut to get something at least. 25% for me, 75% for you.  It's our last chance.",Alice,11,
