I'm going for a big chunk of the money, but leaving Bob with a small amount to hopefully make him accept.  It's risky, but I want to maximize my gains in the first round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While it's frustrating that Bob got the better end of the deal this time, the inflation means my potential gains in the next round would be even lower. Accepting this offer ensures I get at least something, even if it's much less than I wanted."
