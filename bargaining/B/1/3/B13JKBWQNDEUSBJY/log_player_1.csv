"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose to take 90 dollars and give Bob 10 dollars. Since this is the first round, I'm being generous to Bob, but I want to secure a large share of the money for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer to get more, accepting this offer is the most strategic move. The inflation rate is significant for me, and if I reject this offer, there's no guarantee I'll get a better one in the next round.  Additionally, it's important to remember that Bob also faces inflation, though at a lower rate.  Taking this deal ensures I get a substantial portion of the money."
