"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""I'll start with a generous offer. Let's split the money 90-10. If you accept, we can shake on it and be done.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping he'll accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your generosity, but I think a 90-10 split is too lopsided. Let's try a more even 90-10 split, with me taking the larger share this time. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't think Bob's offer is a good deal for me, especially since the money is worth less due to inflation. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'll try to meet you in the middle. Let's split the money 60-40. It's a fair deal, and we can both walk away happy.""
}
```

I'm offering a more balanced split, hoping Bob will accept and we can move forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer is getting closer. I'm willing to compromise, but I believe a 60-40 split is fairer, with me getting the larger share this time. Let's try to reach an agreement before the inflation takes a bigger bite out of our gains. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not willing to give Bob the larger share, especially since the money is worth less due to inflation. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not willing to give up the majority. Let's try a 55-45 split. It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away with something.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still not willing to give Bob the larger share."
