I'm starting with a generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a quick agreement.  It's a good starting point, and I'm confident we can reach a fair outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is incredibly unfair. While I understand inflation is a factor,  his proposal is drastically skewed in his favor. I won't accept such a lopsided deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to account for Bob's inflated gains, but I'm still aiming for a fair outcome.  I believe this offer reflects the current state of the money's value and provides a decent share for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still far too generous towards him.  Even with the impact of inflation, I refuse to accept such a drastically unequal split.  I believe we can still reach a fair outcome with further negotiation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still trying to be fair.  With each round, inflation is impacting Bob's share more and more, so I'm adjusting my offer accordingly. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement before this gets too complicated."
