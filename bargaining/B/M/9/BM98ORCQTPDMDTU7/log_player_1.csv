"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can negotiate from here""
}
```

This offer gives me $600,000 and Bob $400,000. I'm starting with a relatively fair split, and I'm open to negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is a good starting point.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I think 55/45 is a bit too skewed in your favor, I'd like to make a counteroffer""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""Meeting you halfway, let's see if we can find a middle ground""
}
```

I'm making a counteroffer that's closer to my initial offer, but still leaving some room for negotiation."
