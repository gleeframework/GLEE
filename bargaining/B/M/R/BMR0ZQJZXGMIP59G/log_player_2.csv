Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time, Bob.  We're both losing money with each round, so a fair split is the best way to ensure we both get something. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000

user: Congratulations! You have agreed to a deal with Alice! You will be awarded $500,000, but after 2 rounds of inflation, you will actually receive $320,000. Alice will receive her full $500,000!"
