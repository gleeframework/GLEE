Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm increasing my offer to 5500, but still maintaining a majority share. This reflects the value loss from inflation and gives Bob a small increase.  I'm hoping this will be a compromise we can both agree on."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
