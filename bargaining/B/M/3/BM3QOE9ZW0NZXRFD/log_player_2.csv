"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects the fact that the money loses value for both of us over time. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While Alice's offer is ""reasonable"" in the sense of being fair, it's not in my best interest. I know that the money loses value over time, but I lose value at a much faster rate than Alice. I'll try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I believe we can do better. I'm willing to take a smaller share now to ensure I get a larger portion of the remaining value. This offer takes into account our differing inflation rates, and it's a win-win for both of us.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want to maximize our gains. I've adjusted my offer slightly, considering the time pressure and inflation. This is a fair deal that benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd still prefer a larger share, the inflation is starting to take a serious toll on my side. Accepting this offer is the best way to secure a decent amount of money before it loses even more value."
