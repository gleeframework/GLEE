"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

Let's start with a fair, but not overly generous, offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would prefer more, accepting this offer is the best course of action. My gains are significantly reduced due to inflation, and there's no guarantee Bob will offer me anything in the next round. It's better to secure half the remaining value now."
