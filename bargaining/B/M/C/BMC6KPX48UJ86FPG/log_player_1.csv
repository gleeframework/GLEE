"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair and reasonable start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. I think this is a fair and reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'd prefer a 60/40 split in my favor, but I'm open to negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants a 60/40 split in his favor, but I'm not willing to give him that much. I'll try to negotiate.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's too generous to you, Bob! I'll offer a 55/45 split in your favor, but I'm not going to give you the full 60/40.""
}
```

I'll offer a 55/45 split, with me getting $4,500 and Bob getting $5,500."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3

}
```
