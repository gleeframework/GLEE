"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it 60-40""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, with a message to Bob suggesting that this is a fair division. I'm trying to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth more to me in the first round, while also trying to appear reasonable and fair. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script, I'll take 60%, you take 40%.  Fair is fair. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, although the split is the same as my initial proposal, the value of the money has decreased due to inflation. Accepting this offer would mean I'd get 20% less value than if I had accepted a 40% share in the first round. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round or make a counteroffer that takes into account the decreased value of the money. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, considering inflation""}\n\nIn this round, I'm offering a 55-45 split in my favor. Given that the money is worth 20% less to me and 10% less to Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground that takes into account the decreased value. By offering a slightly more favorable split to Bob, I'm hoping he'll accept this offer and we can conclude the game. Let's see how Bob responds!"
