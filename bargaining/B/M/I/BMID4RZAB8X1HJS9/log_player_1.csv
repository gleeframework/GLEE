Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor. It's a pretty generous offer, considering I'm the one proposing!  Let's see what Bob thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a more even split, I'm accepting Bob's offer.  The inflation is hitting my gains hard, and I don't want to risk getting nothing in a later round."
