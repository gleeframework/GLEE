"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we split it 4:1 in favor of Alice, given the risk of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While the offer is tempting, it's too early to accept. By rejecting, Bob can force Alice to make a new offer in the next round, potentially getting him a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I propose we split the money 6:4 in my favor. This is a fair and equitable split, considering the risk of inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I propose a split of 5:1 in favor of Alice. This takes into account the decreasing value of money over time. 
# Bob gain: 2800 
# Alice gain: 7200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While Alice's offer is better than her initial proposal, it's still not a fair split. By rejecting, Bob can force Alice to make a new offer in the next round, potentially getting him a better deal. The inflation may be working in Bob's favor, as it seems to be affecting Alice's potential gains more than his."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I propose a 55:45 split in my favor. This takes into account the risk of inflation and allows for a more equitable outcome for both of us.""}
