"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you $100,000, you'll get $900,000. It's a fair start.""
}
```

This way, I'm giving you a relatively small amount, hoping you'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, a fair and simple solution 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'll have to think carefully.

Since the money is worth 20% less for me, I'll have to adjust my expectations accordingly. The 50/50 split seems reasonable, but considering the inflation, I'd be getting $400,000 (500,000 * 0.8) and Bob would be getting $400,000.

I'll accept this offer.
