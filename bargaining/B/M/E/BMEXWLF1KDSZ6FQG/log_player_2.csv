"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and you get 10%.  We can work on a better deal later. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible deal for Bob! While getting something is better than nothing, waiting out a few rounds will drastically change the power dynamic in the negotiation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""That's not how this works, Alice.  How about a more reasonable split? 70/30""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's try a 60/40 split.  I'm willing to compromise, but I think my contribution deserves a larger share. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is still trying to take a much larger share, even with inflation working against her.  Bob can hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, inflation is eating away at this deal. 60/40 is my final offer.  Take it or leave it.""
