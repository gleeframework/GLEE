"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

I'm going for a large share in the first round, hoping Bob will accept to avoid the risk of getting less in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer more, there's a high risk of getting nothing if I reject and then Bob rejects my offer in the next round.  It's better to secure a good share than gamble on a potentially worse outcome."
