"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This is a terrible offer for Bob.  Even though the money is worth less in later rounds, the goal is to get as much as possible, and this offer is wildly unfair. Let's see if we can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000}
``` 
Let's see if Alice is willing to accept a much fairer deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 150000 
# Alice gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

This is still a terrible offer for Bob. While the money is worth less than in round 1, Alice's offer is still way too skewed in her favor. Let's keep pushing for a fairer split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 800000, ""alice_gain"": 200000}
``` 
Let's try offering Alice a slightly smaller share, but still keeping the majority for myself. The money is worth less now, so let's see if she's willing to take a little less for the sake of getting something."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is still way too lopsided in Alice's favor. The money is worth less now, but I'm not going to settle for such a bad deal just because of inflation. I'll keep pushing for a more equitable split!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000} 
```

It's getting more difficult to reach an agreement as the money is losing value, but I still think I can get a better deal than Alice is offering. I'll offer a slightly lower share for me, hoping she will accept it to avoid getting nothing at all."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice is still trying to take advantage of the diminishing value of money. While this offer is slightly better than her previous ones, it's still not a fair deal. I'll keep trying to negotiate a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000} 
```

Alice is getting greedy, but I think she'll realize that she's going to lose a lot more money if she rejects this offer. I'm willing to take a smaller share, but not a tiny share!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 83.22% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 33.66% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is getting more tempting as the money is worth so much less now, but I'm still not going to accept this. I've already shown I'm willing to compromise, and I'll keep trying to reach a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000} 
```

We're down to the wire, and the money is worth less and less every round. This is my final offer. It's an even split, which is the fairest outcome given the circumstances. Alice has to choose between getting 500,000 or nothing."
