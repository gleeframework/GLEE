"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
I'm Bob, and I'm not going to accept a 5 dollar offer!  Let's see what Alice proposes in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 90, ""alice_gain"": 10}
```

I'm going to try a more equitable split. I'll take 90, and Alice can have 10.  This is a much fairer division."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While 55 dollars is still not a great deal, it's better than nothing.  Given the inflation and that Alice is likely to propose less in the next round, it's better to take what I can get."
