Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to be greedy and start with a big chunk of the money. I'll see if Bob is willing to accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, Bob's offer is a fair split. It's better to take the guaranteed 500,000 than risk getting nothing at all due to inflation."
