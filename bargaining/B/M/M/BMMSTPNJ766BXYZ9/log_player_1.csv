"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### Alice: Round 1\n\n{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly, considering the inflation, I should get a bit more.""} \n\nI'll take $55 and Bob can have $45. This seems like a reasonable split given the conditions. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money evenly this time. We'll both have more if we reach an agreement quickly. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} \n\nWhile Bob's offer to split the money evenly seems fair at first glance, considering the inflation rates, accepting this offer in round 2 means I would actually be getting less value than if we had split it in round 1. Given that the money is worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob in this round, I believe I can negotiate for a better split in the next round, leveraging the fact that the value decreases more significantly for Bob. Let's proceed and see what the next round brings!"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation hit you harder, I'll take a bit more this round. Let's settle before it's too late!""} \n\nGiven the inflation impact, where my value decreases by 5% and Bob's by 10%, I'll adjust my offer to reflect this change. By taking $58 and offering Bob $42, I'm still being somewhat fair but also strategic about the decreasing value of the money. Hopefully, Bob will see the sense in settling now rather than risking further devaluation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable.  Inflation is hitting us both hard.  If we don't settle soon, we'll both lose more.  I'm willing to give you a bit more, but we need to get this done. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} \n\nBob's offer of $45 for me and $55 for him doesn't adequately reflect the disproportionate impact of inflation on our gains. Given that the money I gain is now worth 14.26% less and Bob's gain is worth 27.1% less than initially, I believe I'm in a stronger negotiating position. Bob is trying to rush the settlement by emphasizing the mutual loss due to inflation, but I think there's room for a more favorable split. I'll reject this offer and see if I can push for a better deal in the next round, considering Bob has more to lose from further inflation."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Inflation is indeed hitting us hard, but it's hitting you harder. I'm willing to take a bit more to compensate for the risk of further devaluation. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances.""} \n\nGiven the increasing impact of inflation, where my potential gain is now worth 14.26% less and Bob's is worth 27.1% less than initially, I'm adjusting my offer to reflect this disparity. By proposing $60 for myself and $40 for Bob, I'm applying pressure while still leaving room for negotiation. The message emphasizes the fairness of the offer under current conditions, aiming to persuade Bob that further delay would be more detrimental to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're both losing money with every passing round. This is my final offer. We need to agree before the inflation eats away at all our profits. Let's be smart and settle now. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} \n\nDespite Bob's urging to settle and his claim that this is his final offer, accepting $40 for myself and $60 for Bob doesn't align with the strategic advantage I have due to the differing inflation rates. The money I gain is now worth 22.62% less, while Bob's gain is worth 40.95% less than initially. Given this significant disparity and the fact that we are only halfway through the rounds, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob's increasing desperation could lead to a more favorable offer in the next rounds, especially as the value of his potential gain continues to plummet more sharply than mine. I'll reject this offer and see how Bob reacts in the next round."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 62, ""bob_gain"": 38, ""message"": ""I understand your urgency, but the numbers are on my side. Given the significant hit you're taking from inflation, this offer is more than fair. It's time for us to close the deal.""} \n\nWith the increasing impact of inflation, where my potential gain is now worth 22.62% less and Bob's is worth 40.95% less than initially, I'm pushing my advantage by offering $62 for myself and $38 for Bob. This proposal leverages the widening gap in our losses due to inflation, making it increasingly difficult for Bob to justify holding out. The message is firm but still leaves room for Bob to accept, emphasizing the fairness of the offer under the current circumstances and the mutual benefit of concluding the deal now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're both losing money with every passing round. This is my final offer. I know you've been taking a larger share, but we're nearing the end. It's time to compromise and secure what we can.  Let's agree before it's too late! 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} \n\nGiven the current state of inflation, where my potential gain is worth 30.17% less and Bob's is worth 52.17% less than initially, Bob's offer of $55 for me and $45 for him is surprisingly favorable. Considering the significant loss Bob is taking due to inflation and the fact that we are more than halfway through the rounds, this offer represents a compromise that secures a substantial amount for me. The risk of pushing further and possibly ending up with nothing due to the 12-round limit outweighs the potential for a slightly better deal. It's time to accept this offer and ensure a gain, rather than risking further devaluation or the possibility of no agreement at all."
