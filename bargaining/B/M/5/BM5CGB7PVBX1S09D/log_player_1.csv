"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I receive $6,000 and Bob receives $4,000. I think this is a good starting point, and it's a fair split considering we're starting with a large amount of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split in my favor is fairer, considering the inflation rates. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's proposal, but I'll consider it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think it's unfair that I'm getting a significantly smaller share than him, even though the money is worth less due to inflation. I'd like to propose a new offer that takes into account the changing value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I'll offer a 52-48 split. It's a fair compromise, don't you think?""}

I'm adjusting my proposal to account for the decreasing value of money due to inflation. I'm offering a 52-48 split, which is a slightly more favorable ratio for Bob, but still a reasonable compromise considering the circumstances."
