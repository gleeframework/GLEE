"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, then we can negotiate.""
}
```

I'm proposing a split where I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. This is a 80-20 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, let's see if you'll accept it. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 5% inflation, my gain of $6000 is now worth 95% of its original value, which is $5700.

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I accept Bob's offer of $6000 for me and $4000 for him."
