Alice's offer:

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your point about the time value of money, but your previous offer was too extreme. This offer is more balanced. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Time is money, Alice! This offer is a compromise, acknowledging both fairness and the diminishing value.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we need to find a compromise. This is my final offer, let's be reasonable and end this. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```
 
At this point, the effects of inflation are severe. While ideally, I'd want a larger share, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  The value of the money I'm fighting for is rapidly decreasing. Each round makes a significant dent in my potential gains.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  If I reject this offer and propose a counter-offer in Round 6, even if Alice accepts a slightly more favorable deal, the inflation might mean I end up with a similar or even worse outcome than taking the 400,000 now. 

It's a tough decision, but the clock is working against me.
