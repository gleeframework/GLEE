"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting Bob's offer, I'll think carefully. I'd rather not give him the majority of the money, especially with the value decreasing over time. I'll reject his offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my next offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}

I'm proposing a slightly weighted split in my favor, considering the inflation factor."
