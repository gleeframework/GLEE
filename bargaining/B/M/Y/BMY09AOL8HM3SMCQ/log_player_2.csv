Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but let's not get too greedy. This is a fair compromise considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Okay, Alice, let's find a middle ground. This offer gives us both a decent share, even with the inflation.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to get impatient. You're not being very reasonable, Bob. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage. While her offer is better than nothing (which we'll get in 7 more rounds), I need to push for a better deal. Time is running out, but I'm hoping a firm rejection will make her reconsider in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. I'm offering a perfectly fair 50/50 split.  Take it or leave it - we both lose if this keeps up.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time for a bold move.  Alice is clearly using a tough negotiating tactic, but her offers are getting worse.  Offering 50/50 again achieves a few things:

* **Signals firmness:** I'm not budging much further.
* **Highlights fairness:** It emphasizes how unreasonable her demands are becoming.
* **Implicit ultimatum:**  The ""take it or leave it"" subtly underscores the urgency due to the dwindling rounds.

This is a calculated risk, but with the remaining time, it might be the best shot at a reasonable outcome."
