"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I take 6000, you take 4000. A fair deal considering the inflation working against me. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'll reject this offer. While it seems fair on the surface, the inflation rate means I'll lose more value than Alice if I accept. I'll see what she offers next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 6000,
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I understand the inflation affects us both, but I'm taking a slight advantage this round. Let's see if you'll accept this offer, or if we'll need to keep negotiating."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm losing money faster with each round. Let's be reasonable: 5500 for me and 4500 for you. Take it before it shrinks even more! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice's offer is getting closer to what I want, and the inflation is hurting me more than it's hurting her at this point. Accepting now is the best option."
