"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer is in your best interest. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer heavily favors Alice. While getting something is better than nothing, I'm willing to gamble that I can get a better deal in a future round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4500,
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""I'm willing to be generous, Alice, but this split is fairer given the inflation we're facing.""} 
``` 

This offer is slightly more generous to Alice than a 50/50 split, recognizing that her money is devaluing slower. However, it still secures a significant portion for me (Bob) before inflation eats away at the value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The inflation is hitting you harder than it is me, Bob. Don't be greedy. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice is right, the inflation is hitting me much harder. This offer is better than her first one, and waiting another round will likely result in an even worse deal for me."
