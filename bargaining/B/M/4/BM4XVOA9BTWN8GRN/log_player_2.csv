Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split the difference from our last offers. This is a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is showing willingness to compromise, the deal is still heavily skewed in her favor.  The inflation is hurting her much more than me, and I can leverage that by remaining patient."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and fastest way to end this.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Leveraging Time Pressure:**  By round 4, the inflation is significantly impacting Alice. Offering a 50/50 split now holds more appeal to her than it would have in earlier rounds.
* **Projecting Fairness:**  While I could push for a larger share, a 50/50 split is straightforward and positions me as reasonable. This could make Alice more inclined to accept quickly. 
* **Avoiding Further Losses:** Every round that passes diminishes the overall value of the money. A clean split now guarantees a substantial sum for both of us."
