Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer was quite generous, but let's be realistic. How about a 60/40 split in my favor? Time is money, and inflation is eating away at our potential gains."" 
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand inflation is a factor, but 60/40 is too much in your favor. Let's compromise at 55/45. We both get a decent share and avoid further losses due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```
At this point, it's better to accept. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:**  The value of the money is decreasing significantly for you with each round. A 45/55 split now is better than risking an even worse offer in future rounds.
* **Alice's Position:**  Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, moving from a 90/10 split to 55/45. It's unlikely she'll go much lower.

Waiting any longer exposes you to greater losses from inflation, making this offer the most logical choice.
