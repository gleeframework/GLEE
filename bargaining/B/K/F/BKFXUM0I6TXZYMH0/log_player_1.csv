Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a pretty lopsided offer. I figure that since I'm making the first offer, I can take a bigger share.  However, I'm not going to be greedy, I'm giving Bob a decent chunk. I'm hoping this will convince him to accept the offer and we can both get our money quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

This offer is a lot fairer than the first one, and I don't want to risk getting an even worse deal in the next round. It's a good compromise, considering the inflation."
