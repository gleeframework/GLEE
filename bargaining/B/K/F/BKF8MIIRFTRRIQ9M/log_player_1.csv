"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more balanced split is fairer. Let's start here. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","For round 2, I'll consider the offer from Bob. Since the money is worth 0% less for me and 5% less for Bob, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: $4,500 (since Bob's offer is $4,500, which is 5% less than $4,750)
* Bob gain: $5,250 (since Bob's offer is $5,500, which is 5% more than $5,250)

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","For round 3, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 0% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll aim for a higher share for myself.
