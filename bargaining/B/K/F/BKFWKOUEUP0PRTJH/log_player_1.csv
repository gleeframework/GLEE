"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

This is a generous offer, giving Bob a significant portion of the money to start. Will Bob accept?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to split it 50/50, eh? That's a fair offer, considering the value of the money is decreasing with each round.

I accept Bob's offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
