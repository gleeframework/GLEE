"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split the money evenly. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nSince the offer is to split the money evenly, which is the fairest possible division, there's no incentive to reject and proceed further. Rejecting would imply hoping for more than half in a future round, but since the game is symmetrical and the first offer is already the optimal solution for both parties, accepting is the rational choice."
