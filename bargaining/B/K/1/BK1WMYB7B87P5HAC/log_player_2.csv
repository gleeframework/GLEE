"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. A slightly larger share for me to start, but we can both leave with a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm Bob, and I'm going to try and get a better deal! I'm not sure I like the idea of a ""slightly larger share"" for Alice to start.  I'll see what she proposes next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""I'm feeling generous this round, Alice. Let's switch things up, and see if you'll accept a slightly larger share for me. I think we can still both come out ahead if we play our cards right.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's stop wasting time with these back-and-forths. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both benefit the most.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll accept this offer. It's fair, and with each round, we risk losing more money to inflation. It's time to end this negotiation and both get a good share."
