I'm not going to accept this offer. The inflation has already destroyed the value of the money, and this offer is an insult. I would only get $100, which is an outrageously small share. I'm not going to accept this offer and will have to accept the consequences of not dividing the money.

Since I've reached the 12th round, I'll have to accept that we won't be able to divide the money."
