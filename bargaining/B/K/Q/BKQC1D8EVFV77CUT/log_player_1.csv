"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to get this over with!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair, considering I'm taking on the risk of rejection. Let's move forward. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 10% less, I need to consider the relative values.

In this case, I'd rather stick with the original proposal of a 50/50 split, as it's still a fair and equal split, and I'm not sure if I'll get a better offer in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less now (10% less than the first round, and another 10% less from the second round), I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give away too much!""
}
```

I'm offering a 55/45 split, trying to find a balance between getting a good deal and not risking too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a better deal than your last offer.  Let's split it 55/45 this time. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Wait a minute! Bob's offer is identical to my previous offer, which Bob already rejected! I'm not sure what's going on here...

But, considering the new inflation rate, the money I gain is still worth the same, but the money Bob gains is worth even less than before. I'll accept this offer, hoping that Bob is serious this time.
