"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. I'm starting with a strong offer, but I'm willing to negotiate!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, a fair compromise! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $5,000 is now worth 95% of its original value, so it's equivalent to $4,750.

I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal here. Meeting in the middle sounds reasonable, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject this offer for now and see if I can get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You said meet in the middle, but I think I can do better than that!""
}
```

I'm raising my offer slightly, trying to take advantage of Bob's willingness to meet in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slight edge, but don't think you're getting away that easily! 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $5,500 in round 3 is now worth 85.74% of its original value, so it's equivalent to $4,720.10.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm getting a bit more than my previous offer, but I'm still not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll think about it for a moment...

I'll accept this offer.
