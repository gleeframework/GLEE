{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 evenly, with each of us getting $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking advantage of the inflation to get a slightly better deal this round.  Let's see if you'll accept this offer! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with the uneven split, and I think I can do better. I'll reject this offer and wait for the next round to make a new proposal."

I'm proposing a slightly more uneven split, with me getting $4,200 and Bob getting $5,800. I'm trying to find a balance between fairness and taking advantage of the inflation."
