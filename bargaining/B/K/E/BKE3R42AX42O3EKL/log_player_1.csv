"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}

I'm offering you $4,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping you'll accept it and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can do better. I'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the further decrease in the value of the money due to inflation, my next proposal is:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800
}

I'm offering you $5,800, which is a slightly higher amount than before, but still a relatively small share for me."
