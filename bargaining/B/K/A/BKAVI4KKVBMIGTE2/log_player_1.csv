"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $40, which is a reasonable amount, and I'll take $60. I've also added a message to try to convince Bob to accept my offer. Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, but let's not drag this out. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting Bob's offer. Although the money is worth 10% less now, I think I can get a better deal in the next round. I'll take my chances and make a new proposal. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Come on, let's meet in the middle!""}\n\nI'm making a new offer, taking into account the decreased value of the money. I'm offering Bob $43 and taking $57 for myself. I've added a message to try to persuade Bob to accept my offer. Fingers crossed!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is ridiculous. Half now or we both lose more. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI think it's time to accept Bob's offer. The money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, and it's only going to decrease in value further. Bob's offer of a 50-50 split is reasonable, and I don't want to risk losing more money by prolonging the game. I'll accept the offer and end the game here."
