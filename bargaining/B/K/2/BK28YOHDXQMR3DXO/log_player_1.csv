"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share, Bob. I'll give you $100,000 and take the rest.""
}
```

I'm proposing that Bob gets $100,000 and I get the remaining $900,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, Alice. I'll take 40% and you can take 60%. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less, my gain is now $900,000 x 0.95 = $855,000.

I accept Bob's offer from Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
