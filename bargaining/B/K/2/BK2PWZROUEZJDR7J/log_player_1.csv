"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. This is a generous offer, considering I'm starting strong and can afford to be a bit more flexible. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 5% less, so I'll have to adjust my expectations.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to split the money 50/50, especially since I'm getting less value out of it due to inflation. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my new offer for round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $450,000 and keeping $550,000 for myself. This is a slight adjustment from my initial offer, considering the inflation and the fact that I'm trying to get a better deal. Let's see if Bob accepts this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, so I'll have to be even more careful with my decisions.

I'll accept Bob's offer from round 4.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

This offer is slightly better than my previous one, and I think it's a good compromise considering the decreasing value of money due to inflation."
