```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation factor in mind, I'll re-evaluate Bob's offer.
