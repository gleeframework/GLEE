"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me the majority of the money, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making a decision.

Since Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, it's a fair offer, but I was hoping to get a bit more. However, considering the inflation factor, Bob's offer is actually a good one, and I don't want to risk going to the next round and having the money decrease in value even further.

I'll accept the offer.
