"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair and straightforward way to divide the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but still leaving you with a decent chunk 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, Bob's offer is a significant improvement for me, as I'll still gain $200,000, which is worth the same as it was in the first round.

I accept Bob's offer.
