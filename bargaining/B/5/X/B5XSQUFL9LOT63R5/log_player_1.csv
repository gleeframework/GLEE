I propose to take $6000 and Bob takes $4000. This is a fair starting point, considering we both have equal power in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

I'm proposing a slightly more balanced split this round. Since Bob's offer wasn't ideal, I'm offering him a slightly larger share, but still ensuring I get the majority. This is a strategic move as the inflation rate is hitting him harder than me."
