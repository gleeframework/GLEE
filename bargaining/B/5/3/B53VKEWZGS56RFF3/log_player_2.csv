Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, Alice's offer is becoming increasingly more reasonable due to the rapid inflation impacting her share.  

* **My losses are growing but manageable:** My potential loss is now 18.55%. Rejecting this means I risk losing even more in the next round.
* **Alice's losses are significant:**  Her potential loss is a massive 59.04%. This makes her more likely to accept a less favorable offer in future rounds. However, there's no guarantee she'll offer a better split than this, especially if she's aware of the pressure on me.

It's a gamble, but at this point, securing something is better than risking getting a much smaller amount later."
