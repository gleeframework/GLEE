"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the $100 and Bob gets 20%. The message is a friendly one, trying to set a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going easy on you just yet! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll have to be more careful with my decision.

After considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with the 70-30 split, and I think I can do better. I'll wait for Bob's next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise that's closer to a 50-50 split, while still giving me a slightly better deal due to the reduced value of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give in too easily! 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the significant reduction in the value of money, I'll have to be more cautious with my decision.

After considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think the 60-40 split is a good compromise, considering the reduced value of money. I'm willing to accept this offer and end the game."
