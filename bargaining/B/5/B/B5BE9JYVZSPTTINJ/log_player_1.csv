I'm going for a big chunk of the money, but I'm willing to give Bob a small amount just to show good faith."

I'm still hopeful that we can find a better deal.  Bob is getting greedy!  The value of the money keeps dropping, but I'm not going to give in to his unreasonable demands."

Bob's offer is getting worse with each round, and while the value of the money keeps dropping, I'm not giving in to his greed.  I'll try to make a counter-offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm taking a small risk here, but I'm hoping Bob will see that the value of the money is rapidly decreasing.  I need to secure a larger share, but I'm still offering a compromise."

Round 8

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is ridiculous!  He's taking advantage of the dwindling value of the money, but I'm not going to accept such a small share.  Even though the money is losing value rapidly, I'm going to try to make a counter-offer that is more equitable."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 200000, ""bob_gain"": 800000}
```

This is my final offer. I'm taking a big risk by lowering my share again, but I'm hoping Bob will see the value of the money is rapidly declining.  This is a fair and reasonable offer, and I'm hoping he will accept it before it's too late."
