Congratulations, the game is over!



Let's review the game:
1. Alice (you) offered a 60/40 split, but Bob rejected it.
2. Bob offered a 55/45 split, but you rejected it.
3. Alice (you) offered a 58/42 split, but Bob rejected it.
4. Bob offered a 50/50 split, which you accepted.



Because of inflation, the $50 you gained is now worth $36.45 in the initial value.
