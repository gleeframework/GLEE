"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, I'll get the bigger share this time, but I'll be generous!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000. The message is a friendly one, but I'm hoping it will put some pressure on Bob to accept!"
