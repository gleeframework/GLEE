"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a small amount to get us going.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is 20% of the total, and keeping $8,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $6,000 is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round. Since the money is now worth less, I'm not as keen on giving up as much.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better deal.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. I'll try to get a better deal by offering a smaller share to Bob.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7200,
  ""bob_gain"": 2800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not getting taken advantage of!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a 50/50 split, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $5,000 is now worth 51.2% of what it was in the first round. A 50/50 split sounds reasonable, but I'm not sure if I'm getting the best deal considering the inflation.

I'll accept Bob's offer, but I'm not thrilled about it.
