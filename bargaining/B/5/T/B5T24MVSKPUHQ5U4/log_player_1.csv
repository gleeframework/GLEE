"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 40 dollars, and I'll take 60. Let's end it here!""
}
```

I'm starting with a relatively generous offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more balanced split is better. How about I take 55 dollars and you take 45? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is affecting me more harshly than Bob!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'm not as eager to give up as much as I was in the first round. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's still a bit too generous on your part, Bob. I'm not sure I'm willing to give up 45 dollars in this economic climate. Let's see what you've got next!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is taking its toll, and I need to be more cautious with my proposal. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Given the economic situation, I'm going to have to be more selfish. I'll offer you 30 dollars, but I need 70 for myself to make ends meet. Take it or leave it!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle. I'll take 60 dollars, and you can have 40.  This way, we both get something reasonable even with the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really biting now!

Considering the significantly reduced value of the money, I'm not sure I'm willing to give up as much as 40 dollars. However, Bob's offer does seem like a reasonable compromise, and I don't want to risk going to another round with even lower values. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, Bob, I think we've both taken enough risks. Let's meet in the middle and call it a day. I'll take 40 dollars, and you can have 60. Deal!""
}
```"
