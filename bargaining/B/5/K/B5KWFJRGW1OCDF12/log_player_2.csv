I'm going to reject this offer.  Even though it seems fair, the inflation means that I'll get less money in later rounds if we don't reach an agreement.  I want to see if I can get a better deal for myself."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate the effort to maximize our gains, but let's aim for a more balanced distribution. How about 65/35? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000
