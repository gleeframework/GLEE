"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

I'm going to start by being generous and offering Bob a small share.  I figure this might encourage him to accept early, saving us both the hassle of further rounds and the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject Bob's offer. It's a huge power shift compared to my previous offer, and it's not worth it to accept such a small share, even with the risk of inflation.  I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal in the remaining rounds."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject Bob's offer. While it's better than the previous round, I'm still not willing to accept such a small share, especially with the increasing inflation. I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the remaining rounds."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}

# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. While it's better than the previous round, it's still far from a fair deal. Inflation is eating away at my share, but I'm not giving in to Bob's demands. I'll continue to negotiate for a more balanced split."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than previous rounds, I'm still not willing to accept such a drastic reduction in my share due to inflation. I'm confident I can still negotiate a better deal in the remaining rounds."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

Inflation is making this increasingly difficult, and I'm worried about the remaining rounds.  I'm proposing a 50/50 split in this round, hoping that Bob will be willing to accept a fair deal and avoid further negotiation."
