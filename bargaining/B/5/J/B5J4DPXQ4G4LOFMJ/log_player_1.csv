Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a pretty aggressive offer.  I want to take the majority of the money, but I'm giving Bob a small amount to incentivize him to accept.  It's risky, but I think it's worth it.  I'll be watching how much inflation affects the money in the next round to adjust my strategy."
