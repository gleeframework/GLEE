"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we divide the money in a 3:1 ratio, with you receiving $2500. I believe this is fair considering the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds. 
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While the offer is tempting, it's likely Alice will offer me less in subsequent rounds. I'll try to get a better deal by rejecting and making my own proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly. I think this is a fair and simple solution, considering the decreasing value of the money for me in each round.""}
