Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. This is a fair offer, as we both get a significant portion of the money. Accepting this will allow us to avoid further inflation and its potential downsides. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000
