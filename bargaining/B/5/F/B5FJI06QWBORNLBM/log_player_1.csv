"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your generosity in the first round, but I'm hoping for a slightly bigger share this time. Since we're both getting discounts, I think a 55/45 split is a fairer outcome. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
