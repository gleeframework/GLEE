"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose taking 90 dollars for myself, and leaving 10 dollars for Bob. I believe this is a fair starting point, as it allows for a large initial gain for me while still leaving Bob with something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
This is a fair and equal split, and while I could try to negotiate for more, I risk losing everything if we run out of rounds."
