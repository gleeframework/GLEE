"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}
```

I propose a 990,000:10,000 split. I'm taking the lion's share, but I want to be fair and give Bob a small amount to incentivize him to accept.  We both get something, and I maximize my gain in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though the offer is less than what I proposed in the first round, the inflation means my gain is worth significantly less. Accepting this offer guarantees me $400,000, while rejecting it and making a counter-offer might result in me getting nothing at all due to further inflation."
