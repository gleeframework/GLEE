"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point.""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial 100$ and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair to split it evenly, since we both have equal say in the decision. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think it's fair that Bob gets 60% of the remaining 100$, considering that the money is worth less than it was in the first round. I'd like to make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you a bit more, but I think this is a fair split considering the inflation.""}

I'm proposing that I get 45% of the remaining 100$ and Bob gets 55%."
