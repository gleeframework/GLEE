  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer, Bob. Accept and we can shake on it.""

# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, $200,000 is a decent amount, but I was hoping for more. On the other hand, Bob is getting a larger share, which is a concern.
