"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}
``` 

I propose a 990,000 - 10,000 split in my favor. This is a generous offer, given I could just take all the money. It's a good start to build trust, and I hope Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer more, this is a fair split and I don't want to risk further inflation."
