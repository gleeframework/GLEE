"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to get it over with. No need for further negotiations.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping to get it over with quickly and avoid any potential risks of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 4000, but I think I deserve more for being the one to make the next offer 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of 4000 is actually worth 4000 * 0.9 = 3600 in the previous round's value.

Since I'm getting a slightly lower amount than I initially proposed, I'll reject this offer. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

```

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's now my turn again. I'll make a new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm offering a 55/45 split, hoping to get a better deal than what Bob offered me in the previous round."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: I'll give you 4800, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation is affecting me more 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of 4800 is actually worth 4800 * 0.727 = 3493.6 in the first round's value.

Since I'm getting a slightly higher amount than what I proposed in the previous round, and considering the inflation, I'll accept this offer.
