Round 2

Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's compromise. Inflation is hurting both of us, but I'm willing to take a slightly lower amount to avoid further losses. This split seems like a good middle ground. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

""decision"": ""accept""
}

**Reasoning:**

While this is the same offer Bob gave in Round 1, it's important to consider the impact of inflation. 

* **My losses:** Accepting $6,000 now means I've effectively lost 14.26% of its value compared to Round 1. 
* **Bob's losses:** Bob accepting $4,000 now means he's lost a significant 27.1% of its value compared to Round 1.

If I reject this offer, there's a high chance the deal will get worse for me in the next round due to inflation. Bob is clearly feeling the pressure of inflation more acutely, making it less likely he'll offer me a better deal in the future."
