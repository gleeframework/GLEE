"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""My turn! This offer accounts for the inflation we'll both experience.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Understanding Inflation:** It's crucial to recognize that the value of the money decreases each round. This means we need to be increasingly willing to accept a smaller portion of the pie as rounds progress.
* **Strategic Advantage:** I'm making the offer in Round 2, giving me a slight advantage. Alice knows that if she rejects this offer, the value of her potential gain will decrease in the next round. 
* **The Offer:**  While the split seems slightly in my favor, it's important to remember that Alice's $4800 is worth more than what my $5200 will be worth in the next round if she rejects. This incentivizes her to accept a deal now."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, this is a fair deal! 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to take advantage of my position due to inflation. While her offer seems ""fair"" on the surface, it doesn't adequately account for the fact that my potential gains are decreasing at a faster rate than hers.  I need to hold out for a deal that reflects this disparity."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4800,
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""message"": ""Time is running out, Alice. This is a deal that considers the shrinking pot for both of us.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Accelerated Losses:** With each round, my potential earnings are decreasing at a faster rate than Alice's. It's vital to secure a deal sooner rather than later.
* **Strategic Concession:**  I'm conceding slightly more than I'd like in this round, offering Alice a slightly larger share. This might seem counterintuitive, but it's a calculated risk. 
* **Urgency:** My message emphasizes the time pressure. Alice knows that if she rejects this offer, we both stand to lose significantly more in the following rounds. This deal might be her last chance for a favorable outcome."
