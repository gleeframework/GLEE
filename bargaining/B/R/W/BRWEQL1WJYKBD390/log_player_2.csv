"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer leaves us both with a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer heavily favors Alice. While it seems like a decent amount now, the inflation will hit me much harder than Alice in later rounds. I need to aim for a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Alice, my turn. I understand you value the early rounds, so I'm proposing a split that accounts for that.  Let's settle this now.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this offer still gives you a good share considering the inflation working against me. Let's wrap this up. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is trying to take advantage of my position, but the discount to my share is still too high. It's clear she's feeling the inflation pressure, so I'll hold out for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6300, ""alice_gain"": 3700, ""message"": ""Alice, time is running out for both of us. I've adjusted my offer slightly, reflecting the increasing pressure from inflation. Let's be reasonable and end this here.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Let's just split it down the middle and call it a day. This is the last time I'm offering a deal this good. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice is finally feeling the heat. While a 50/50 split wasn't ideal in the beginning, the significant inflation working against her makes this the best offer I'm likely to get at this point.  It's time to take the deal."
