Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose to keep $90 and give $10 to Bob. I'm starting with a high offer to see if he's willing to accept a smaller share early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I'm not going to let him get away with it. I'm going to keep fighting for a fair share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm offering a compromise to Bob. I'll lower my share slightly, but I still believe in a fair split.  Hopefully, this will convince him to accept before things get worse due to inflation."
