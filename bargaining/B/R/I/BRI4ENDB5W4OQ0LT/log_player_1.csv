I propose that Alice receives $900,000 and Bob receives $100,000. This seems like a fair starting point, considering the money will lose value over time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 900000

I'm offering 800,000 for Alice and 200,000 for Bob. While I am willing to concede some of my share, I believe it's important to maintain a significant portion of the money. I hope Bob will reconsider his position and accept this offer."

While the inflation is starting to hit hard, I'm still not comfortable accepting such a low offer. I believe we can find a more equitable solution."

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering 600,000 for Alice and 400,000 for Bob.  We're running out of time, and I'm making another significant concession to try and reach an agreement.  It's becoming increasingly risky to keep rejecting offers."

Round 8

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even though the inflation is taking a toll, I still believe we can find a more balanced agreement.  This offer feels too lopsided in Bob's favor."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

We are down to the wire. This is my final offer -  500,000 for Alice and 500,000 for Bob.  It's a 50/50 split, which is the most fair and equitable solution given the circumstances and the risk of getting nothing at all.  Let's not let the remaining rounds pass by and lose everything."
