"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, then we can negotiate from there.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split, with me getting $8,000 and Bob getting $2,000. This is a relatively fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a more reasonable split. Let's see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the value of the money is decreasing, so I need to be careful not to get too little.

I'm not thrilled about the 2:3 split, but I think it's a bit more reasonable than the first offer. I'll accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
