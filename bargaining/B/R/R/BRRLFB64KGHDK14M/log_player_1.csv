"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is 40% of the initial amount. This way, we both get a decent share, and we can negotiate further in the next rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, Alice. Let's try for a more balanced split this time. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less, my share of $5,000 is now worth $4,750.

I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

This seems like a reasonable compromise, and I'm willing to take $4,750 as my share for now."
