# Alice's message: Considering the increasing inflation impact on your gain, this offer is more generous than the previous one. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000

Round 4

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""This is my final offer for an even split.  The inflation is quickly eroding any potential gains for me, so I need to draw a line.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns about inflation, but I still think I deserve a slightly larger share. This is a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a tough decision, but with the inflation rapidly eroding my potential gains, it's better to accept a less than ideal offer than risk getting nothing at all in later rounds."
