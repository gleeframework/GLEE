Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is using the inflation against me, but I need to hold out for a better offer. Accepting only $3000 now, even with the heavy inflation, feels like a defeat. I need to signal I'm willing to risk it going to later rounds."
