"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the value of the money is declining for me with each round. Let's end this here. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
