"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'm willing to compromise""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is a 40% share of the initial $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gain, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth less, I'd like to negotiate for a bit more.

I'll reject this offer for now and make a counteroffer in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, my gain will be worth 5% less than in the previous round, and Bob's gain will be worth 10% less than in the previous round.

Here's my counteroffer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think I deserve a bit more""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think this is the last offer I'll make, so think carefully! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is catching up with us! My gain is worth significantly less than it was in the first round. Considering the offers we've exchanged, I think this is a decent compromise, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll accept this offer, as I don't want to risk going into further rounds with even lower values.
