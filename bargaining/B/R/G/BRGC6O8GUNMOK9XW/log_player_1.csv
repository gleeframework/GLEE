"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

This way, I'll get 80% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob will get 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain is worth even less now. I'll have to think carefully...

After considering the offer, I decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm hoping to do better than a 30% share!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In Round 3, I'll try to do better. Considering the inflation, my offer will be:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""bob_gain"": 600000
}
```

I'm aiming for a higher percentage now!"
