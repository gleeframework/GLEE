"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a very lopsided offer. I figure this will give Bob a strong incentive to counter-propose in the next round, and hopefully we can arrive at a fairer split quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
This is a fair offer, I'll accept."
