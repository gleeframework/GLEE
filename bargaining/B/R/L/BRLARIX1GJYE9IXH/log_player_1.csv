Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm feeling the inflation pressure. This offer matches your initial proposal. Let's settle this now before it shrinks further. 
# Alice gain: 525000 
# Bob gain: 475000

This is a good time to accept. Here's why:

* **Bob is feeling the pressure:**  The message indicates that Bob is starting to understand the impact of the inflation mechanic. 
* **Matching the initial offer:** He's willing to accept a deal that's less favorable than his previous offer, highlighting his desire to settle.
* **Future uncertainty:** While you might be able to squeeze a tiny bit more from Bob, there's no guarantee.  Continuing the game risks him becoming increasingly desperate, potentially leading to less rational offers."
