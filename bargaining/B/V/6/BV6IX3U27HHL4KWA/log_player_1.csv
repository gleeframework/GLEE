Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take a slight lead""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I take 60 dollars and Bob takes 40 dollars. I'm framing it as a ""fair"" split, but with a slight advantage for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob's message: I think a more balanced split is fairer. Let's try this. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about the 45-55 split, as I was hoping to get a slightly better deal. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further."

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a more balanced and fair division of the money. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finally settle on a deal."
