"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

This is my first offer, and I'm trying to be generous while still securing a good portion of the money.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. While it's better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what I proposed in the first round. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for such a lopsided split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 810000, ""bob_gain"": 190000}
```

I'm lowering my share slightly to account for the inflation, but I'm still aiming for a fair distribution. I'm confident that we can reach an agreement this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While this offer is still significantly less than what I was aiming for, the continued inflation is making it risky to keep rejecting offers.  I'll accept this to secure at least something, but I'm not happy about it."
