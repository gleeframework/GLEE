"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share this time, but I'm hoping we can reach a fair agreement. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 45-55 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I need to adjust my expectations.
