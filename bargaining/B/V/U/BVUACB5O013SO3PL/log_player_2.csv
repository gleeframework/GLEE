"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that takes into account the decreasing value of money for me. Since the money is worth 20% less for me in each round, I want to get a bit more than half to make up for it.\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a fairer split.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Let's split it 55-45, considering the inflation we both have to deal with. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer because, despite Alice's willingness to compromise, the deal still doesn't favor me enough considering the higher rate of inflation I'm facing. The money is now worth 36% less for me, so I need a better offer to compensate for this loss.\n\n###\n\nLet's proceed to the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","In this round, I'll consider the significant decrease in value for me and try to propose a division that reflects this. Since the money is worth 36% less for me and only 9.75% less for Alice, I'll adjust my offer accordingly.\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""Given the substantial difference in inflation impact, I believe this split is more reasonable.""}"
