# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, Alice. It's a fair deal. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a slight risk, Alice. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 
 
This is a tough decision, but time is working against me faster than it is against Bob.  While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting 40 now is better than risking an even worse offer in a future round where the value has depreciated further."
