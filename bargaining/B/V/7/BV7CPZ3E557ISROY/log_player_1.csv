"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 7:3 split is fairer, with me taking the larger share since I'm taking the risk of the next round. Let's finish this. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
