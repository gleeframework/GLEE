"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you get 40%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of 3000 is actually worth 2400 in the first round's money.

I'm not sure I want to meet in the middle, but I'll consider it. I'd rather not accept this offer, since I think I can do better. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, my gain will be worth 20% less than in the previous round, which is 20% of 2400 = 480, so my gain is now worth 1920.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I still think I deserve more. This is my best offer so far.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly smaller share, but I'm not going to give you all the power 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate my gain in the first round's money. In the third round, my gain was worth 1920. With 48.8% less, my gain in the fourth round is 1920 * 0.516 = 990.24.

I'm not thrilled with this offer, but I'm not sure if I can do better. I'll accept this offer.
