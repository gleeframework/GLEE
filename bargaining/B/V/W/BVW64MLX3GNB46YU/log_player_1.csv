"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept this and we can move on.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept it and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I think I deserve more. Try to do better next time! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my share is now worth 5% less than the initial $900,000, which is $855,000. I'm not happy with Bob's offer, as he's trying to take a huge share of the money. I'll have to do better next time.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and hope to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

Here's my new offer:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Let's split it down the middle.""

# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my share is now worth 14.26% less than the initial $900,000, which is $775,140.
