"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $100, which is $40. I'll take the remaining 60%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll evaluate the offer accordingly. 

In this round, the total amount is $100, but it's worth 80% of its original value due to inflation. So, the actual amount I would gain from Bob's offer is 50% of $80, which is $40. 

I'll accept Bob's offer.
