"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair.  I'll take 90% and you can have 10%.  I think it's a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
It's better to see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I think a more equitable split is 55/45. This way, we both get a significant amount of money, and it's a fair starting point for negotiation.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but 55/45 is still too much in your favor.  Let's go with a 60/40 split.  That's a fair compromise considering the inflation we're both dealing with. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While a 60/40 split is better than the previous round, I still believe I can get a better deal if we continue negotiating."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
