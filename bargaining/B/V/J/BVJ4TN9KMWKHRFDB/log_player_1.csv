"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but it's still a good deal 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I need to be careful. My gain of $300,000 is worth 95% of the original $500,000 I would have gotten in the first round, which is $475,000. That's a decent deal, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject this offer for now and see if I can do better in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to give away too much.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a decent share and keeping a significant amount for myself."
