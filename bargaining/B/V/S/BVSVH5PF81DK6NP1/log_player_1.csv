I propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor. I figure I should get the lion's share since I'm the one making the first offer.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

A 50/50 split is fair, and since the money is decreasing in value for Bob, I don't see him offering me more in the future.  Let's take the 5000 and move on!"
