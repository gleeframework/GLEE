Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Even though the money is worth less for me, it's getting to the point where it's more advantageous to accept the offer rather than risk getting a worse deal in the next round."
