"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, but let's be realistic - I'm taking the lion's share.  Accept this and we can be done. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make my proposal. The current offer doesn't seem fair, and I'm willing to take the risk of the money being worth less in the next round to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that is more reasonable, considering the inflation that affects me but not Alice. I'll aim for a more balanced split, while also taking into account the devaluation of the money for me in subsequent rounds.

{""bob_gain"": 450000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's compromise. I'm willing to give you a slightly bigger share, but I need more than what you offered last time. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nConsidering the inflation and the fact that the money is worth 19% less for me now, I'll calculate the actual value of the offer.

The original 1,000,000 is now worth 810,000 for me (1,000,000 * 0.81, due to 19% inflation).
The offer of 400,000 for me would be equivalent to approximately 324,000 in the original value (400,000 * 0.81).

Given this, I'll decide whether to accept or reject.

{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not satisfied with this offer, as the actual value I'd receive is lower than what I aimed for in my previous proposal. I'll take the risk of another round to try and get a better deal, despite the increasing inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make another offer, taking into account the increasing inflation and its impact on my gain. Since the money is worth 19% less for me now, I'll adjust my proposal accordingly.

{""bob_gain"": 510000,
""alice_gain"": 490000,
""message"": ""Considering the growing impact of inflation, I'm adjusting my proposal to ensure a fairer split for both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway.  This offer is fair, given the inflation you're dealing with.  Accept it and we can finally be done with this. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation and the fact that the money is worth 34.39% less for me now, I'll calculate the actual value of the offer.

The original 1,000,000 is now worth 658,610 for me (1,000,000 * 0.655, due to 34.39% inflation).
The offer of 450,000 for me would be equivalent to approximately 295,245 in the original value (450,000 * 0.655).

Given this, I'll decide whether to accept or reject.

{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI'll accept this offer. Although the actual value I'll receive is significantly lower than what I initially aimed for, the increasing inflation makes it risky to continue. This offer seems relatively fair considering the circumstances, so I'll settle for it to avoid further devaluation."
