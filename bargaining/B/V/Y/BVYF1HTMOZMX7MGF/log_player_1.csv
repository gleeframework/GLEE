"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start to our negotiation!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me $600,000 and Bob $400,000. I'm starting with a relatively generous offer to set the tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a better deal, but I'm not giving up much more than this! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not willing to accept such a lopsided deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's still too skewed in your favor, Bob! I'll wait for a better offer.""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 75-25 split, especially after your initial offer was already too generous to me. I'm hoping for a more balanced deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll aim for a slightly more aggressive split to compensate. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob! Let's make a deal!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, trying to find a balance that's more favorable to me, but still reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer to my target, but I still want a bit more! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value quickly due to inflation! I'm not happy with this offer, especially since it's even more skewed in Bob's favor than his previous one. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's still too far from what I'm comfortable with, Bob. I'll hold out for a better deal.""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 45-55 split, especially after the value of the money has decreased so much. I'll keep pushing for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth even less due to inflation, I'll try to be more aggressive in my offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
 ""message"": ""Let's call it a draw, Bob! 50-50 split, no more haggling!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, trying to find a fair and balanced deal in the face of inflation."
