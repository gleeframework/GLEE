Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, inflation is eating your share, not mine. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nIt seems like Alice is trying to take advantage of the inflation situation. I'll take a closer look at the numbers.
Since the money I gain is worth 19% less than in the first round, the actual value of the $3000 offered is approximately $2430 (3000 * 0.81).
Considering this, I'll make a decision.
