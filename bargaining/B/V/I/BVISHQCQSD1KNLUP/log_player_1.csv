"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be realistic, Alice. I'm willing to take a smaller cut this round, but we need to find a sustainable solution. I think a 45/55 split is a good starting point for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
