"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair to me. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm still trying to keep a bit more for myself. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is affecting me more than Bob, it seems!

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll decide to reject it. I'd rather wait for a better offer that takes into account the increasing inflation rate.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer that takes into account the increasing inflation rate. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not getting taken advantage of""
}
```

I'm trying to account for the 10% inflation rate by offering Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping a bit more for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up my advantage yet. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on me now!

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll decide to reject it. I'm not willing to accept a 35% share, especially since the money I gain is worth significantly less due to inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really biting!

Given the current situation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the significant decrease in the value of the money. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3800,
  ""bob_gain"": 6200,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of by the inflation""
}
```

I'm trying to adjust my offer to account for the 27.1% decrease in the value of the money I gain, while still trying to negotiate a fair deal."
