Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split evenly this round. We can always negotiate further if we need to.

# Bob gain: 5000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand inflation is affecting you, but I also want to ensure we both get a fair share. I'm offering you a bit less this round, but it's still closer to an even split than your previous offer. Let's work towards a solution where we both benefit. 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting to take advantage of the situation. While his message sounds conciliatory, he's offering less than what he would have gotten in the first round (where I proposed a similar split in his favor). This suggests he's trying to maximize his gain while the inflation eats away at my potential earnings.  It's too early to accept an offer where I'm significantly disadvantaged, even with the inflation pressure."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, with each passing round, we are both losing money. While I acknowledge the impact of inflation on you, I also need to ensure a fair share for myself. This offer is a compromise that balances our needs, let's make a decision and move forward. 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Bob is trying to pressure me with the ""losing money"" argument, but he's still consistently aiming for slightly above a 50/50 split.  He's betting I'll crack under the inflation pressure.  However, accepting this offer would mean I get even less than his initial offer in round 1, which was already  unfavorable considering the inflation.  I need to hold firm a bit longer and see if he's willing to make a genuine concession."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5100,
""bob_gain"": 4900,
""message"": ""Bob, this is a compromise.  I'm taking a smaller share than my previous offers to get this settled. Let's be reasonable and end this now before inflation eats away at the value even further.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's getting late in the game, and while Bob is playing tough, I need to show some flexibility to avoid getting nothing.  This offer is my attempt to find a middle ground that might be acceptable to him.  I'm offering slightly more than an even split, acknowledging the inflation impact but still trying to secure a reasonable amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to compromise again to avoid further losses due to inflation.  I believe this offer is fair and offers a better outcome for both of us than continuing to negotiate. Let's end this now and take what we can. 
# Alice gain: 4950 
# Bob gain: 5050 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

The pressure is really on now.  Bob is still angling for slightly more than half, but this is the closest he's come to an even split. Accepting means I lose out compared to earlier rounds, but rejecting risks a worse outcome.  If we continue, I might be forced to accept an even lower amount in a later round due to the accelerating inflation. It's a tough decision, but at this point, taking a small loss is preferable to walking away with nothing."
