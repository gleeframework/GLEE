"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $10,000 and leaving 40% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, the $5000 I would gain in this round is worth less than the $6000 I could have gained in the first round. I'll reject this offer and try to do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation effect, the money is worth 40% of its original value now. I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, the $4500 I would gain in this round is worth even less than the $8000 I could have gained in the third round. However, it's still more than the $2000 I could have gained in the third round. I'll accept this offer to avoid further losses.
