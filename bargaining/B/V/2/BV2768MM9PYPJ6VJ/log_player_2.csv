Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the offer is getting better, accepting now would mean losing a significant chunk of the potential gain. Alice knows time is on her side and is likely to propose an even better deal in the next round or two as the pressure increases."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  Take this offer before we both lose everything. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**  This is a tough one. Alice is clearly getting anxious and playing on my fear of losing everything. However, accepting this offer means I lose out on a significant amount of the initial potential.  There's a high chance Alice will make a much better offer in the next round or two to avoid getting nothing herself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Alice, it's now or never. A 50/50 split is the only fair option at this point.""}
```

**Reasoning:**  We're down to the wire.  Alice is likely panicking now, knowing that if this offer is rejected, she risks losing everything. This 50/50 split ensures I get a reasonable share, even with the inflation, and avoids the catastrophic outcome of getting nothing."
