"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking a risk by offering you a smaller share, but I think we can do better than your initial proposal. This way, we both get a larger share now, and I'm willing to take the risk of the money's value decreasing further. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
