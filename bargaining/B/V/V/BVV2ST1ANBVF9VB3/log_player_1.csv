"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to try and secure the majority of the money for myself, but I'm also leaving a reasonable portion for Bob. I'll be watching how the money changes in value, and I'll adjust my strategy as the game progresses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While this offer is better than nothing, I believe I can still get a better deal.  I'm going to try to negotiate a more favorable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to try to secure a larger share than Bob's offer, but still leave enough to incentivize him to accept. The inflation is starting to hit, so I need to be more aggressive with my proposals."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Inflation is really starting to impact the value of the money. I'm not thrilled with this offer, but given the decreasing value of the money, it's the best I can hope for at this point."
