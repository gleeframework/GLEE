It's better to see what Alice will offer in the next round, as I have 12 rounds to negotiate and there's no inflation on my side in this round."

Alice is still offering a significantly smaller share for me, and I can still wait for a better deal. There is no inflation on my side this round and I can continue to see how her offer changes."

# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice's offer is still not close to an even split, and the inflation seems to be affecting her more than it is affecting me. I'm willing to wait and see if she'll offer a more balanced split in the future."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000

Alice's offer is the best one yet, and it's getting closer to an even split. With only 5 rounds remaining, accepting this offer seems like the best strategy."
