Alice's offer:

Round 2

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The clock is ticking, Bob. This is a fair offer considering the decreasing value. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""This is my final offer, Alice. The value is plummeting, and this is the best you'll get. Don't let greed cloud your judgment.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Time is running out, Bob. This is my final offer. Let's end this rationally before the value diminishes further. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, accepting is the most rational choice for Bob. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:** The value of Bob's potential gain is decreasing rapidly with each round. Accepting $450,000 now is better than risking a worse offer in the next round, where the value would decrease even further. 
* **Alice's Final Offer:** Alice has stated this is her final offer. Holding out might force her to stick to it, leading to a potential stalemate where Bob gets nothing.
* **Uncertainty:** There's no guarantee that Bob can negotiate a better deal in subsequent rounds. Alice seems to have the upper hand due to the inflation disadvantage Bob faces.

While $450,000 is less than Bob's previous offers, it's crucial to remember the time-sensitive nature of the situation. By accepting, Bob secures a significant amount and avoids the risk of being left with nothing."
