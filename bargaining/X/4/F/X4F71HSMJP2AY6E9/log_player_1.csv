I'm going for a very high gain for myself in the first round. Since I don't know how Bob will be affected by inflation, I'm assuming he might be more willing to accept a small amount early on.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a classic game theory scenario!  Bob is clearly using a similar strategy of trying to get as much as possible early on. I won't be fooled. I'm going to reject his offer and see if he'll become more reasonable as we get closer to the end and inflation hits harder."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to try to be more reasonable this round. I'm offering Bob a larger share, but still keeping the majority for myself.  I'm hoping that seeing his offer rejected might make him think twice about pushing for the maximum share right away."
