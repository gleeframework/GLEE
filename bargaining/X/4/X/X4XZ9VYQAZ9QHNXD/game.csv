4000.0,6000.0,"I think it's fair to split the money 60/40 in my favor this time. After all, you got the better deal last round.  Let's make this quick and get the money split!",Bob,2,
,,"That's not fair, Bob.  We should be aiming for a more even split, especially with the inflation working against us both.",Alice,2,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, let's be reasonable.  I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor.  It's closer to even, and we need to settle this before inflation eats away at the value.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Let's be practical, Alice. We're losing money with every round. I'm proposing a 50/50 split to avoid further losses.  It's the fairest option at this point.",Bob,4,
