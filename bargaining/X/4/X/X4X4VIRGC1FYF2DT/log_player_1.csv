"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's start with a 50/50 split, a fair and balanced start to the game! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking its toll!

Considering the new values, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, I'll have to decide whether to accept it or reject it and try to negotiate for a better deal in the next round.

I'll reject the offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slight edge this time, but I'm still looking for a fair deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share this time. Let's see if you agree! 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll now!

Considering the new values, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since Bob's offer is a 58/42 split, I'm not thrilled about giving him a larger share, but I'm also aware that I need to make a decision to move forward.

I'll accept this offer for now, hoping that the next round will bring a better deal.
