Round 2

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Look, it's getting ridiculous with this inflation.  Let's just split it evenly and call it a day.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I know inflation is eating into your share, but I'm not budging much 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

The game dynamics have shifted considerably. While I'd ideally want a 50/50 split, the ongoing inflation is severely eroding my potential gains. Accepting Alice's offer of $43, even with a 34.39% reduction, yields a better outcome than risking further losses in subsequent rounds."
