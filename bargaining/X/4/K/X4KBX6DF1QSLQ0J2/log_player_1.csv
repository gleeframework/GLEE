"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous, I'll take a bit more this time 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not a good start for me!

I'll think carefully before responding. Since the money is worth less with each passing round, I'll try to make the most of this offer. Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll accept Bob's offer for now.
