"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable, Alice.  My turn now, and the value is dropping fast for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Although the money is losing value, Bob's offer is still significantly skewed in his favor. I'm willing to take a slightly smaller amount to avoid further inflation, but not that low. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

""alice_gain"": 55,

""message"": ""The value is dropping, Bob, let's settle this. This is a compromise considering the inflation.""
