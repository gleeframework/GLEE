600000.0,400000.0,"Let's be fair and divide the money in a way that we both benefit. I'll take 60% and you can have 40%. This way, we both get a good amount and we can end this game early.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"I think we can both do better than that. Let's split it 60/40 in my favor, and call it a day.",Bob,2,

580000.0,420000.0,"I see you're a tough negotiator, Bob. I'm willing to compromise a bit. I'll take 58% and you can have 42%. This is a fair offer, considering the inflation is affecting your gain.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"I'm sticking with my previous offer. It's the fairest way to split the money, considering the inflation.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
560000.0,440000.0,"Bob, your offer is still not acceptable to me. Considering the inflation, your 60% is actually worth much less now. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I still need to get the bigger share. Let's do 56% for me and 44% for you.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, I understand you're trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I'm not going to budge on this. My offer is final. Take it or leave it.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
540000.0,460000.0,"Bob, I understand you think your offer is final, but I'm not buying it. With the inflation, your 60% is now worth less than 20% of the original value. I'm being generous by offering you 46% at this point. Take it or we'll keep playing.",Alice,7,

500000.0,500000.0,"Alice, I'm tired of this game. Let's just split the money 50/50 and be done with it.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
520000.0,480000.0,"Bob, I can see you're getting desperate. A 50/50 split is not acceptable to me, considering the inflation has barely affected my share. I'm willing to give you a slightly better offer than before, but it's still not going to be an even split. Take it or we'll keep going.",Alice,9,
