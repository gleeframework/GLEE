"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor. Since we're playing against inflation, I want to secure a large portion of the money early on. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer. Even though the money is worth less now, I can still get more by making a counter-offer in the next round.  I'm hoping Bob will be willing to negotiate a fairer split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, reflecting the inflation that has occurred. I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise, but still aiming for a fair deal."
