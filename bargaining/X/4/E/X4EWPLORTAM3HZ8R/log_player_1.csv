Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to propose a fairly even split in the first round, aiming for a balance between fairness and maximizing my share. It's a bit risky since Bob could reject it, but I'm hoping to secure a good starting point.  Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is a significant improvement over his initial rejection. Even though I'm getting less than I wanted initially, accepting means I secure at least half the money.  With inflation being a factor, I need to be practical and secure what I can. It's a win-win situation for both of us."
