Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm taking most of the money, but giving Bob a single dollar to incentivize him to accept. I'm curious to see if he'll bite in the first round!  Let's see what he says."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a fair offer, and I don't want to risk getting nothing if we keep playing.  It's better to take half than to gamble on a better outcome and end up with nothing!"
