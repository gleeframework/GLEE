"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and reasonable for the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting Bob's gain, I'll have to consider that. Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll think carefully about this offer. Considering the inflation, Bob is essentially offering me $400,000 in today's value, which is a smaller share than the 50% I initially proposed. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer, I'll make a new proposal that takes into account the reduced value of the money. Since the money is worth 0.8 (1 - 0.2) of its original value after one round of inflation, I'll aim to adjust my proposal accordingly. Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000
}

I'm proposing a slightly skewed split, giving Bob a slightly larger share to try to reach a deal."
