"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}
```

I'm going for a high initial offer, hoping to secure a large portion of the money early.  I know there's inflation, but I'm hoping Bob will be tempted by even a small gain in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, the inflation is starting to bite.  Accepting this offer guarantees me half the money, which is a lot better than risking it all and getting nothing."
