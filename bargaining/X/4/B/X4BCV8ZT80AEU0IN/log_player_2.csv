"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I'm starting the negotiations with a 60/40 split in my favor.  I believe this is a reasonable offer to get the game going. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While Alice's offer isn't terrible, there's still a lot of room for negotiation.  I'll see if I can get a better deal for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is more equitable. It's still a fair starting point, and I'm willing to negotiate further if you're not satisfied.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle. I'll counter with my previous offer: 55 for me, 45 for you.  Every round that passes diminishes the value, let's wrap this up. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is tempting, but I'm still holding out for a more even split.  I'll see if I can get a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's just split it down the middle.  It's fair and avoids any further risk of losing value due to inflation.  What do you say?""}
