"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0
}
```

I'm taking the whole $100, and offering Bob nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll accept Bob's offer. I'll take $40 and Bob will take $60. It's a good compromise, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with the money being worth even less.
