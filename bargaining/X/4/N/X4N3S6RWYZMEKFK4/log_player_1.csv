"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}

I'm going to propose a very generous deal in the first round.  I'm hoping Bob will be happy with a small amount and accept the offer. This way, we can avoid the risk of inflation affecting my share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer.  While it's a significant improvement from the previous round, I'm still confident that I can get a better deal.  The inflation effect on Bob's offer is much higher than mine, which means he's likely feeling the pressure to come to an agreement.  I'll see if I can negotiate a more favorable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I'm going to increase my share slightly from the first round, but still offer Bob a decent amount. I believe this offer is reasonable considering the inflation and the fact that Bob rejected my previous offer.  I'm hoping this will be enough to entice him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 750000 
# Bob gain: 250000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm going to accept this offer. The inflation is really starting to bite, and it's unlikely I'll be able to get a better deal in the next few rounds. This offer gives me a decent amount of money, and I'm not willing to risk getting nothing at all."
