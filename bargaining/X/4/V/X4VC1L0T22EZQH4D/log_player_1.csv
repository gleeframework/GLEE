"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a big chunk of the money, but I'm leaving Bob with a small amount to incentivize him to accept. Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's a lot better than Bob's initial offer, the inflation has significantly lowered the value of the money I'm getting.  I'm going to see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
``` 

I'm going to increase my proposed share from the last round, but still leave Bob with a significant amount to incentivize him to accept. I think this might be a good compromise given the inflation we're experiencing."
