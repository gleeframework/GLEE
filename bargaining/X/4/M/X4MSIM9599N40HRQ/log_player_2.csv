"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. I take a bit more considering the inflation risk. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer was a bit too skewed for my liking. Let's be reasonable - how about we take a more balanced approach? Time is money, after all, and it's losing value for both of us.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate the sentiment, but the initial split needs to account for the inflation I'm facing. This offer is a compromise. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to push me towards a less favorable split by highlighting the inflation she faces. However, I'm aware that time is also costing me potential gains. While her offer is closer to a reasonable split, I'll hold out for a slightly better deal in the next round."

Round 4

{
""bob_gain"": 525000,
""alice_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's find a middle ground. I understand the inflation pressure you're under, but this split acknowledges the time value of money for both of us. We need to settle this quickly.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but the clock is ticking, and the inflation is eating into my share. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** 

This is a tough call, but time is running out.  Alice has indicated this is her final offer, and while it's not ideal, it's better than risking getting nothing if we don't reach an agreement. Accepting now secures a reasonable sum, even if it's slightly less than I hoped for."
