"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair but generous offer.  I'll take 90%, you get 10%.  Hopefully we can reach a deal quickly. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: In this scenario, accepting the offer would result in Bob receiving $100,000, which is a significant amount of money but considerably less than what Alice would receive. Given that the money's value decreases by 20% with each round and that this is only the first round, there is substantial room for negotiation to achieve a more equitable distribution. Rejecting the offer allows Bob the opportunity to propose a different division in the next round, potentially leading to a more favorable outcome. Additionally, the threat of further value reduction due to inflation may prompt Alice to be more flexible in subsequent rounds, increasing the chances of reaching a more balanced agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Let's meet closer to the middle. Given the money's devaluation, it's in both our interests to settle soon.""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: Considering the 20% devaluation of money with each round, it's crucial to attempt reaching an agreement as soon as possible to maximize the value of the money received. By offering a division of 45% for Bob and 55% for Alice, the proposal moves closer to a balanced split, acknowledging Alice's initial generosity while also recognizing the need for a more equitable distribution. The message emphasizes the urgency due to inflation, encouraging Alice to consider the offer seriously to avoid further loss of value in subsequent rounds."
