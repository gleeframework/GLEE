"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

``` 
I propose taking 95$ and giving Bob 5$.  It's a fair starting point considering the inflation factor, and leaves room for negotiation in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This is a terrible deal for me! The money I would gain is worth much less than the first round, and Bob's offer is much higher. I'll risk it and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm going to try to split the money more evenly this time, acknowledging the inflation factor but also aiming to make the offer more appealing to Bob than his previous offer."
