"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, to see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still not giving up too much 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 0% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll think carefully about the trade-off.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now. I'm not willing to accept a 40/60 split. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. I'll try to make a counteroffer that's more favorable to me.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, which is a bit more in my favor, but still a reasonable compromise. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not giving up too much more 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's new offer, taking into account the effects of inflation on the money he gains. Since the money is worth 0% less for me and 14.26% less for Bob, I'll think carefully about the trade-off.

I'll accept Bob's offer this time. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
