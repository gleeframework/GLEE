Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money with a 7:3 ratio. This is fair considering the risk and potential loss due to inflation.

# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm Bob, and I want a better deal.  A 7:3 ratio is unfair to me considering how much the money will be worth less in the next round. I want to see what kind of offer Alice is willing to make next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
