Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split in my favor is more fair. We can continue to negotiate, but I don't want to get bogged down in too many rounds.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
