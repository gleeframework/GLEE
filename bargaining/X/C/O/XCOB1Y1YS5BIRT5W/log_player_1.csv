"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}

This way, I get 70% of the original $100, and Bob gets 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but the money Bob gains is worth 10% less, I should be more cautious. My initial instinct is to reject this offer, but I'll consider it for a moment...

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the inflation and the fact that Bob's money is worth 10% less than in the previous round.

Since the money is worth 10% less each round, and it's now worth 90% of the original value, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the decreasing value. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of the decreasing value of the money. Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, but the money Bob gains is worth significantly less, I should be cautious.

However, considering the large difference in value between our gains, I think I should accept this offer. The risk of further inflation and Bob making an even worse offer in the next round is too great, and I'd rather take what I can get now.
