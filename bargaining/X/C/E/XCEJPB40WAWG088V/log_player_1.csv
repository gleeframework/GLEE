"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

This is my first offer. I'm trying to be generous, but also secure most of the money for myself! I'm confident Bob will accept, since getting $1 is better than nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to have more, this offer is still very good. If I reject it, I have to risk Bob getting a larger portion of the money in the next round due to inflation."
