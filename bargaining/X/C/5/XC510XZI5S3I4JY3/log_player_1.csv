"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'm offering Bob 40% of the money and keeping 60% for myself. I've included a message suggesting fairness, hoping Bob will see the reasonableness of the offer and accept it. Since this is the first round, the full value of $1,000,000 is still intact, and I'm aiming to secure a significant portion while still appearing generous to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we should both get a little more than half this time. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, considering the inflation, my share of $400,000 is actually worth less than its face value, while Bob's share remains unaffected by inflation. Given that the total value for me has decreased, I believe I can negotiate for a better split in the next round or make an offer that might be more advantageous for me, taking into account the decreasing value of the money for my side."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet closer to the middle""}\n\nGiven the impact of inflation on my potential gain, I'm adjusting my offer to ensure I still receive a substantial amount while appearing to compromise by moving closer to an equal split. Since the money's value decreases by 10% for me with each round, I'm trying to balance between securing a favorable amount and the risk of further devaluation if the game continues. By suggesting meeting closer to the middle, I aim to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and potentially end the game before the inflation further erodes my potential winnings."
