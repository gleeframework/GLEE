Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I see you want a bigger share.  Let's try 72/28.  This still gives us a decent amount, and hopefully, we can agree on something before the inflation eats away too much of our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 2800 
# Alice gain: 7200
