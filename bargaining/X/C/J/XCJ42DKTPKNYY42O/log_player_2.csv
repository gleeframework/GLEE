"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less after one round, the total amount is now $8,000. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts I'll gain and Alice will gain, considering the inflation:

My gain: 4500 / 0.64 = 7031.25 (since 100% - 36% = 64% of the original value)
Alice's gain: 5500 / 0.9091 = 6040.45 (since 100% - 9.75% = 90.25% of the original value)

Considering this, my offer is not as good as Alice's offer. I'll accept.
