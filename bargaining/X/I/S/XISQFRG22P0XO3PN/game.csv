,,,Bob,1,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Alice, your initial offer was a bit skewed in your favor. I'm proposing a 55/45 split.  Let's be reasonable and close this out quickly.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5800.0,4200.0,"Bob, let's not drag this out. I'm being flexible, but the clock is ticking, and the money is losing value for me. 58/42 is my final offer.",Alice,3,

5600.0,4400.0,"Bob, it seems like you're enjoying wasting both of our time.  I'm dropping my offer slightly again to 56/44, but I won't go any lower.  Take it or leave it.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  Let's just split it evenly and call it a day. 50/50 - there's no point in dragging this out and both losing money.",Bob,6,
