Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting closer, but I still think I deserve a bit more 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

The game is reaching a critical point. While I'm losing value due to inflation, Alice is consistently aiming for a larger share. Accepting 4300 now is better than getting nothing in Round 12, but I need to push for a better deal in the next couple of rounds. The risk is that Alice might not budge, but the potential reward of securing a larger portion is worth the gamble."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  Let's end this now with a fair 50/50 split. Don't be greedy.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to put a stop to Alice's attempts to exploit the inflation disadvantage. A 50/50 split is the fairest option and sends a clear message that I won't accept anything less. There's still a risk Alice will reject this, but it establishes a firm stance and increases the pressure on her as we move closer to the deadline."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're finally willing to meet me halfway, but I think I've waited long enough to deserve a bit more 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision, but the risk of walking away with nothing is getting very real. Alice is clearly entrenched in her position and unlikely to accept anything less than 56%. Accepting now still gives me a reasonable share, even with the inflation, and avoids the disaster of a complete loss if we fail to agree."
