"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, giving Bob a 40% share of the initial $1,000,000. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth 10% less, so I'll have to adjust my calculations accordingly.

The offer from Bob is a 50-50 split, which is a bit more aggressive than my initial offer. However, I'll consider it since it's still a relatively fair split.

I accept this offer.
