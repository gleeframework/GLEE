40.0,60.0,"I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve more considering the risk of inflation. I'm offering a 60:40 split, a fairer ratio considering the current market.",Bob,2,

50.0,50.0,I've decided to keep the offer closer to a 50/50 split. I believe this is fair given the risk of inflation and the fact that we're both taking a chance here. Let's aim for equality in this round.,Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
45.0,55.0,"I'm willing to give you a slight advantage, but I'm not ready to go 50/50. I think 55/45 is a more reasonable compromise, considering the inflation and the fact that I've been taking more risk so far.",Bob,4,
