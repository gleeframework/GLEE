"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can finish the game quickly.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000 and keeping $9,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'd like to propose a fairer split.  Let's start with a more even distribution. 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not a chance!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not going to accept an offer where I get only $1,000, especially since the money is worth 20% less now. I'd like to make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You said you wanted a fairer split. This is a 70/30 split, which is more generous than before. Accept and we can move forward.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable and split this 50/50.  The money is losing value quickly, and this is the most equitable way to move forward. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value quickly, indeed!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think Bob's 50/50 split is a reasonable proposal, especially considering the rapid inflation. It's better than continuing to negotiate and risking getting even less value for my share."
