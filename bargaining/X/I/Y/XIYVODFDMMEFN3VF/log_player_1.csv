"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm proposing a very uneven split in my favor. Since I don't know how inflation will affect Bob, I'm taking almost everything. However, it's still a chance for him to get *something* rather than nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I don't know how inflation will affect Bob, I'm gaining a significant amount of money in this offer. Even with the risk of further inflation, this is a much better deal than getting nothing."
