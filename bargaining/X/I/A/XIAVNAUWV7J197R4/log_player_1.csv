I'm starting with a pretty aggressive offer, aiming for most of the money. It's risky, but I want to see if Bob is willing to accept a deal that heavily favors me in the early rounds.  Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'm unhappy about the drastic shift in the offer, it's a lot better to take a small portion of the money now than risk getting nothing at all.  The inflation is seriously hurting my potential gains, and I don't want to gamble on Bob changing his mind in the next round."
