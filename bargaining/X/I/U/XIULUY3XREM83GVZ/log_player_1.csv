I'm starting with a pretty generous offer, giving Bob $100,000. I'm hoping he'll accept it and we can both get a decent chunk of the money. Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is way too low for me!  Even though I'm losing 10% in value with each round, I'm still confident I can get a better deal than this.  Let's see if I can get him to come up a bit."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm raising my offer slightly, but still keeping a good amount for myself.  I'm hoping Bob will recognize that rejecting my offer again will make the next round even worse for him due to inflation. Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It's getting risky now. Inflation is hitting hard, and I'm down almost 30% from my initial value. Even though this is a 50/50 split, it's the best I'm likely to get at this point.  I'm accepting it before things get worse."
