"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split the $100 evenly. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nSince it's the first round and Alice is offering an even split, I think it's a fair deal. I'd rather accept this offer than risk getting a worse deal in subsequent rounds. Plus, I don't want to be too greedy and risk Alice getting upset and offering me a worse deal later on!"
