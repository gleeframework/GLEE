"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose taking 90% of the money, leaving 10% for Bob. I want to secure a large portion early on, as the inflation will hurt Bob more than me in the coming rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is worse for me than my initial offer, even accounting for the inflation.  I'm willing to risk the next round and propose a different split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to adjust my offer slightly, aiming for a larger share but still offering Bob something.  I need to be mindful of his higher inflation rate, but I believe this offer is still favorable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still worse for me than my previous offer, even after accounting for the inflation. The gap between what we both receive is widening, and I believe I can do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

I'm going to take a slightly more aggressive approach. I'm willing to offer Bob a little more, but I need to secure a larger share for myself to counteract the increasing inflation.  This offer is a compromise between our previous proposals."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is significantly higher for me than his previous offer, it's still not enough to compensate for the massive inflation he's facing. I believe I can still secure a more favorable deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm again adjusting my offer slightly, aiming for a larger share for myself. I believe this offer balances my need to offset the inflation while also offering Bob a reasonable amount given his high inflation rate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still much lower than my desired share, even with his high inflation rate. The remaining rounds are crucial, and I'm not willing to settle for a deal that's so unfavorable for me. I'm confident I can achieve a better outcome in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}
```

I'm willing to offer Bob a slightly larger share this round, but I need to maintain a sizable portion for myself.  The inflation is really starting to hurt both of us, but I still believe this offer is the best way to ensure we both get something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 86.58% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

With only 2 rounds remaining, the inflation is severely impacting both of us. While it's not ideal to receive an equal share, this offer is the best I can reasonably expect given the circumstances.  Accepting this offer guarantees that I receive something, while there's a significant risk of getting nothing if I continue to reject offers."
