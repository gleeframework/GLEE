Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a risk and offer you a smaller share now, hoping to negotiate a better deal later. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer may seem tempting at first, it's important to consider the long-term consequences. By accepting this offer, Alice sets a precedent for future rounds. This could lead to Bob becoming increasingly greedy, potentially leading to a situation where Alice receives very little in the later rounds. 

It's better to stand firm and hold out for a more equitable split, even if it means risking reaching the final round with a lower overall gain."

{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""I understand you're aiming for a bigger share, but I believe we can both benefit from a more balanced approach. Let's try to find a compromise that ensures we both get a decent amount.""}

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve more considering the risk I'm taking. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can find a deal. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is offering a slightly better split than in the previous round, it's still far from a fair deal. He's attempting to exploit the inflation factor, offering a significantly lower share to Alice despite the diminishing value of her gains. 

Rejecting this offer sends a strong message that Alice won't be taken advantage of. It also increases the pressure on Bob to make a more reasonable offer in the coming rounds."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable. I've been willing to negotiate, and I'm offering a fair split. If we keep going like this, we both risk losing a lot more in the end.""}

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to get impatient. I think I deserve a bigger share, and I'm willing to take a risk to get it. You're not going to get a better offer from me. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Despite Bob's attempt to pressure Alice, the offer is still far from fair. The inflation rate is significantly impacting Alice's gains, making this offer even more disadvantageous. By continuing to reject, Alice sends a clear message that she won't be bullied into accepting an unfair deal. 

While the risk of getting nothing in the later rounds is real, it's better to hold out for a more equitable split. There's still a chance Bob might realize he needs to compromise, especially with the looming threat of both getting nothing."
