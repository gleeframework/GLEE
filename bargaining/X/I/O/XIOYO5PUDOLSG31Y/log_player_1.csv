"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a moderate offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering to take 60 dollars and leave 40 dollars for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my share is now worth 20% less, so I need to be more cautious. I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the continued inflation. Since my share is now worth 40% less than the initial 60 dollars, I'll aim for a slightly higher percentage. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm offering a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept this time."
