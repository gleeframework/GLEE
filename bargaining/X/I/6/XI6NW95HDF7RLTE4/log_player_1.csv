Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take on more, considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 420000 
# Bob gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob claims to be taking on more, the deal is still heavily skewed in his favor. The inflation is eating significantly into my potential gains. It's worth risking another round to aim for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 480000,
""bob_gain"": 520000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is my final offer. It accounts for the inflation, but also gives you a slight advantage. Let's close this deal."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I need to increase my offer to make it more appealing to Bob, especially with the increasing impact of inflation.  Offering 480,000 is a compromise, acknowledging the inflation while still aiming for a reasonably fair deal. The message emphasizes the finality of the offer, hoping to push Bob towards acceptance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the significant inflation, I think this is a fair split 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is becoming a severe penalty at this point.  While Bob's offer is far from ideal, accepting guarantees a payout.  Rejecting it risks an even lower offer in the next round, where the inflation will further erode my potential gains. It's a bitter pill to swallow, but the risk of walking away with significantly less is too high."
