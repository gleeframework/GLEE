"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}

This way, I get 70% of the initial amount, and Bob gets 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll have to think carefully... With the money being worth 10% less each round, I'd rather get a larger share now than risk waiting for a better offer that might not materialize.
