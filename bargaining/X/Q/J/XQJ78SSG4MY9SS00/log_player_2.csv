Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, this is a fair compromise. 
# Bob gain: 5200 
# Alice gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Impact:**  Alice is feeling the pressure of inflation. Her offer is getting closer to a more even split, signaling her willingness to compromise.
* **Future Uncertainty:** If I reject this offer, there's no guarantee I can secure a better deal in subsequent rounds. Alice might become even more desperate and offer a smaller amount.
* **Present Value:**  While I could aim for a higher gain, the difference is becoming less significant compared to the risk of getting even less if the game continues. 

This offer is strategically sound to accept."
