"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but it's a fair offer 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I can still consider the offer in terms of the original $100.

However, I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with Bob taking the majority of the money, especially since the game is still early on. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal.

I'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a bit more, but still a fair split""
}
```

I'm trying to negotiate for a slightly better deal for myself, while still keeping the split relatively even."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm still not giving up 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider the offer in terms of the original $100, but taking into account that the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round.

Since the money Bob gains is worth significantly less than in the first round, I'm starting to feel the effects of inflation. I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, as it's still a relatively close split, but I'm not getting a great deal considering the decreasing value of the money.

However, I don't want to risk going to the next round, so I'll accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
