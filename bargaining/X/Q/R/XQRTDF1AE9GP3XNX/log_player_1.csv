"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $600,000 and Bob gets $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 5% less, I'd rather get a larger share now to compensate for the loss of value. I'll reject this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In round 3, the money is worth 10% less than in the first round. I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the inflation.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth even less now, so I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the inflation. However, Bob's offer is a bit more balanced than my previous offer, so I'll consider it.

I'll accept this offer.
