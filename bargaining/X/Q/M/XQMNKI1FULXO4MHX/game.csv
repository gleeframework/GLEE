900000.0,100000.0,Let's make a deal. This offer is highly advantageous to you in the early rounds due to the inflation.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
100000.0,900000.0,"I propose a fairer split, taking into account the inflation advantage you have.  Let's agree now and avoid the risk of getting nothing later.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
850000.0,150000.0,I understand the situation. Let's be reasonable. This offer still gives you a good deal considering the inflation.,Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
200000.0,800000.0,"Let's end this now.  My offer is a significant improvement from your last one, and it avoids the risk of both of us losing everything.  Accept it and let's be done with this.",Bob,4,

300000.0,700000.0,"Alice, the inflation is hitting hard. We're running out of time. My offer is the best chance we have of getting something. Let's end this now before it's too late.",Bob,6,

,,,Bob,7,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, we're both losing money with each round.  This is our last chance to get anything at all.  I'm offering a significant compromise, and it's the best we can do at this point.",Bob,8,

500000.0,500000.0,"Alice, we're down to the wire.  It's clear we're not going to agree on a drastically uneven split, and the inflation is eating away at our potential gains.  This is a 50/50 split.  It's the only way we can both get something, and the only way we can avoid getting nothing at all.  Accept this and let's walk away with something.",Bob,10,
