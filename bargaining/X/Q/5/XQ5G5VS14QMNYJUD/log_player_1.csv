Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we need to settle this now. This offer prevents a significant loss for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nGiven the significant impact of inflation on both our potential gains, accepting this offer seems prudent. The difference in the value of money lost due to inflation is substantial at this point, and going further might not yield a better outcome for me, especially considering the risk of ending up with nothing if we fail to reach an agreement within the 12 rounds.\n\n###\n\nI believe this is a fair deal at this stage of the game, and it's better to secure this amount rather than risking further devaluation of the money or the possibility of getting nothing."
