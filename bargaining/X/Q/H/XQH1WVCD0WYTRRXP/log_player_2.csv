"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal, Bob. I take $60, you take $40.  It's a good offer to start with considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better offer. The inflation penalty isn't too severe yet, and I'd like to try to negotiate for more."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's try to find a middle ground. Considering the inflation, I think this is a fair offer.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out and this money is losing value, especially for you. I'll take a little less this time, $55, leaving you with $45. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}
### 
I'll hold out for another round to see if Alice is willing to compromise further. The inflation penalty is starting to add up, but I still think I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle, but I still think I deserve a bit more considering the decreasing value of the money for me.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, let's be practical. I'll take a bit less again, $52, and you get $48.  Every round costs us, especially you! Let's settle this now. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on my potential gain, I think accepting this offer is the best decision. The difference between our proposed offers is minimal, and further rounds will only decrease the value of the money for me. It's time to settle and get something rather than risking further loss."
