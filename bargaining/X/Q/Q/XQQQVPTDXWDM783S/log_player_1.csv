"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose taking 900,000 for myself and giving Bob 100,000. This seems like a fair starting point, but I'm aware of the inflation and will adjust my strategy accordingly in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While the offer from Bob is better than what he offered in round 1, it's still not a good deal for me.  The inflation is making the money worth less, and I'm willing to risk another round to try and get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm increasing my offer to Bob in this round.  I'm hoping this shows good faith and will lead to a deal.  I'm still very aware of the inflation, but I'm trying to find a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money, Bob's offer in this round is the best I've seen so far.  Given the risk of further rounds and the uncertainty of Bob's future offers, I'm choosing to accept."
