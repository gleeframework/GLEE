"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn to propose!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a fair 40% of the original amount. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started high, now it's my turn to make a counteroffer. I'll give you less, but it's still a good deal. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to negotiate. Since the money is worth 20% less for Bob, I'll have to consider that when evaluating the offer.

In this round, the total amount is still $1,000,000, but the value of the money has decreased due to inflation. My gain of $300,000 is worth the same as before, but Bob's gain of $700,000 is worth 80% of its original value.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting Bob's offer because, in real terms, I'd be getting $300,000 worth of value, while Bob would be getting $560,000 worth of value (80% of $700,000). That's not a fair deal for me, considering the value of the money has decreased for Bob. I'll wait for his next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think you can do better than this. Let's meet in the middle!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, offering Bob a slightly lower amount than before, but still a reasonable share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going to meet you in the middle, but I'll give you a bit more. It's still a good deal for me. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the real value of the money in this round. Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I still get $450,000, but for Bob, it's worth 51.2% of its original value (100% - 48.8% = 51.2%).

In real terms, my gain of $450,000 is the same as before, but Bob's gain of $550,000 is worth $282,000 (51.2% of $550,000).

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting Bob's offer because, in real terms, I'd be getting $450,000 worth of value, while Bob would be getting $282,000 worth of value. That's still not a fair deal for me, considering the value of the money has decreased for Bob. I'll wait for his next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share. This is my final offer!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a good deal and getting a fair share for myself. This offer is a bit more generous than my previous one, but I'm still hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You've been trying to lowball me, now it's my turn to make a strong offer. This is my best deal, take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 470000 
# Bob gain: 530000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the real value of the money in this round. Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I still get $470,000, but for Bob, it's worth 32.77% of its original value (100% - 67.23% = 32.77%).

In real terms, my gain of $470,000 is the same as before, but Bob's gain of $530,000 is worth $164,511 (32.77% of $500,000, I assume Bob meant $500,000, not $530,000).

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer because, in real terms, I'd be getting $470,000 worth of value, while Bob would be getting $164,511 worth of value. Although the value of the money has decreased significantly for Bob, it's still a fair deal for me, and I'm willing to end the game here."
