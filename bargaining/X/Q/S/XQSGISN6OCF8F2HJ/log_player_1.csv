"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 900k-100k split in my favor. This ensures I get a substantial share and leaves some room for Bob to potentially accept in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, my gain is worth 10% less due to inflation. Accepting this offer guarantees me $400,000, whereas rejecting it risks getting nothing in the next round."
