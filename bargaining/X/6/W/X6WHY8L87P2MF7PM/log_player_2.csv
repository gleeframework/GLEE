Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is making small concessions, the impact of inflation is increasing significantly. Accepting now would mean a significant loss in potential earnings for Bob compared to the beginning.  It's worth risking a few more rounds to see if Alice will offer a more equitable split, especially as the pressure of running out of rounds mounts."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""This is my final offer - a perfectly even split. Take it or leave it.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The impact of inflation is becoming severe. While a 50/50 split isn't ideal, it's becoming increasingly risky to hold out for more.  This firm offer puts the pressure on Alice. If she rejects, she knows Bob is likely to demand a larger share in subsequent rounds to compensate for inflation, which might force her to settle for less than 50% in the end."
