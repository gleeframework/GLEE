Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're right, compromise is key. I've shifted closer to the middle ground again. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is moving towards a more even split, we're still in the early rounds.  There's room to negotiate, especially since she's showing a willingness to compromise."

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out. This is a very fair offer, and I'm willing to compromise further to avoid both of us losing everything. Don't let this opportunity slip away. 
# Bob gain: 490000 
# Alice gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  Alice is right, time is running out. Her offer is now very close to even, and it's highly unlikely she'll go any lower. Accepting this offer guarantees a significant sum, while continuing to push could result in both of us getting nothing.  It's a risk I'm not willing to take at this point."
