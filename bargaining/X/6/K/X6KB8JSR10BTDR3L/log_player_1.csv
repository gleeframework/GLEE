"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 70/30, I'll get a good chunk and we can still be friends""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $70 and Bob gets $30. The message is a friendly one, hoping to set a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, no need to be greedy 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my $70 is now worth less, so I need to be more cautious. Bob's offer of meeting in the middle is a reasonable one, and it's a fair split.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I accept Bob's offer of a 50/50 split."
