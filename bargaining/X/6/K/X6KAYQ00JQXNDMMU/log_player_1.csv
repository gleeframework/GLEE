"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your fairness, but I believe we can both do better. Let's try a 60/40 split in my favor, considering the inflation in the next rounds. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't think Bob is being entirely fair, considering the inflation affects him more than me. I'll reject his offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60/40 in his favor, I'll try to counter with a more favorable split for myself. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting a free ride! I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better deal.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway. 55/45 is a fair compromise given the inflation and the limited rounds left. Let's end this game on a positive note. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to make a comeback. However, I'm not convinced that 55/45 is the best deal for me, especially considering the inflation is affecting him more. I'll reject his offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 55/45, I'll try to take it a step further and propose a more favorable split for myself. Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 58,
  ""bob_gain"": 42,
  ""message"": ""You're getting desperate, Bob. I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I need to take the lead.""
