Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I see your point about the inflation. Let's split it 50/50 this time.  It's a fair deal for both of us, and we can avoid further rounds of negotiation. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000
