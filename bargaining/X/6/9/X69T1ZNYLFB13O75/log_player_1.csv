"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This offer gives me 80% of the initial $10,000, which is a fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll have to reassess the offer.

Since Bob's offer is 50/50, I'll think it's a bit too even for me. I'd like to get a slightly larger share.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In Round 3, the money is worth 5% less than in Round 2 for me, and 20% less than in Round 2 for Bob. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm aiming for a slightly higher share this time, considering the reduced value of the money. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value!

Considering the significant decrease in value for both of us, I think Bob's offer is actually quite reasonable. I'd rather take this offer than risk waiting for the next round and potentially getting even less.
