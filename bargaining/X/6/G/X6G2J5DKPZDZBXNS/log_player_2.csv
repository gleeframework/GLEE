"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money fairly. I'll take 600000 and you'll get 400000. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see if we can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than that. Let's split it 60/40 in my favor. I'm willing to compromise.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the decrease in value due to inflation, I propose a split of 540000 for me and 460000 for you. This maintains a fair distribution while accounting for the current economic situation. 
# Bob gain: 460000 
# Alice gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a better split, accepting this offer ensures I get something and avoids the risk of getting nothing at all due to further inflation."
