# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's too early in the game to accept such a lopsided offer. We have plenty of rounds to negotiate a fairer split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's start with a 50/50 split.  It's a fair starting point and we can adjust from there if we need to.""}

# Alice's message: I'll compromise, 58 for me, 42 for you, it's closer to 50/50 but I still get a bit more 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
It's still too early to accept a deal that's not even close to 50/50, especially as inflation is starting to bite."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to move closer to your offer, but I think a 55/45 split is fairer considering we both have to make concessions. Let's aim for a win-win.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll meet you halfway between my last offer and your last offer, 57 for me, 43 for you, it's a good compromise 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

We're getting closer, but I still think a 50/50 split is the fairest, and I'm not willing to concede so much to inflation yet."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""I'm still pushing for a 50/50 split. Inflation is affecting us both, and it's the only way to ensure a truly fair outcome.  Let's try to agree on this before it's too late.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation is affecting you more, I'll make a slight concession, 56 for me, 44 for you, it's the lowest I'm willing to go 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

Inflation is starting to hurt significantly, and while I'd prefer a 50/50 split, this offer is getting close enough to where I don't want to risk losing everything."
