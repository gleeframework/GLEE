I propose to take $9,000 and leave $1,000 for Bob. This is a fair starting point, considering I have the first offer and we both need to agree on a split."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8500, ""bob_gain"": 1500}
```

Since Bob rejected my previous offer, I'll reduce my share slightly to $8,500 and increase Bob's to $1,500. This should incentivize him to accept, considering the value of the money is decreasing with each round."

{""alice_gain"": 7500, ""bob_gain"": 2500}

I'm continuing to lower my share, now offering $7,500 to myself and $2,500 to Bob. This is becoming a risky game with the inflation, and I need to find a solution soon."

It's clear that Bob is playing a very hard game. The inflation is becoming a serious concern for me, but I'm still determined to get a better deal than $2,500.  I'll continue to negotiate."

{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to what I'd like, but I still believe I can get a slightly better deal. With only 2 rounds left, the inflation is a major factor, but I'm willing to gamble for a better outcome."

Round 11
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500}
```

I'm taking a big risk here, but I'm offering $6,500 to myself and $3,500 to Bob. This is my final offer, and with only one round remaining, the inflation will be extremely impactful. I believe this is the best possible deal I can get, considering the circumstances."

Unfortunately, I'm left with no other choice. The inflation has taken its toll, and I have to accept what Bob is offering. It's not ideal, but I'm better off with $3,500 than nothing at all."
