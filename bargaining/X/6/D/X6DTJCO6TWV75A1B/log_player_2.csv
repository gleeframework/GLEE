"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""My turn to propose a fair split.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You had your chance, now it's my turn again 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""This offer is better for both of us in the long run.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Time is on my side, you're losing value 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Even though the offer is getting worse, I need to hold out for a better deal. Accepting $40 now means I'm losing a significant chunk due to inflation. If I reject, there's still a chance Alice will offer a higher amount in the next round to avoid further delays (and potential losses for herself in later rounds)."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's stop wasting time with inflation. A 50/50 split is the fairest option.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is eating away your share, take this before it's too late 
# Bob gain: 38 
# Alice gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision point. While unfair, Alice is clearly playing a waiting game, knowing that inflation is hurting me more than her. 

* **Continuing the game is risky:** If I reject this offer, there's no guarantee Alice will offer me anything better in the next round. She might even decrease her offer, realizing I'm becoming increasingly desperate.
* **The impact of inflation is significant:** Accepting $38 now might be better than holding out for a slightly higher amount later, which would be further eroded by inflation. 

It's a bitter pill to swallow, but accepting minimizes potential further losses due to the game's mechanics."
