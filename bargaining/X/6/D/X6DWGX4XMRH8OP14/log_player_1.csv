"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to take the majority of the money in this first round, as the inflation will hurt Bob more than me.  We'll see how he reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more money, the inflation is going to significantly reduce the value of Bob's offer in future rounds, so accepting this 50/50 split is the best way to ensure I get a good amount of money."
