Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and time is running out. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI accepted Bob's offer. The game is over, and we'll split the money 50/50. It's not the best deal for me, but considering the inflation and the risk of getting nothing if we don't agree within the 12 rounds, I think it's a reasonable decision."
