"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, hoping that Bob will see it as a reasonable proposal and accept it, considering we're in the first round and the money's value will decrease for me in subsequent rounds. Fingers crossed!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. Let's be reasonable. This offer won't be on the table for long. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5700,
  ""bob_gain"": 4300,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""
}
```

I've adjusted my offer to be slightly more favorable to Bob, while still taking into account the 5% decrease in value for me. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a compromise and accept it, rather than risking further rounds and potentially losing out on a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Getting desperate, but still room to negotiate""
}
```

I've decided to make a slightly more aggressive offer, despite the decreasing value of the money for me, in an attempt to put pressure on Bob to accept. I'm hoping he'll realize that I'm not backing down and that we're running out of rounds, making it more likely that we'll both end up with nothing if we don't come to an agreement soon."

# Bob's message: Take this offer Alice. It's the best you'll get. 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100
