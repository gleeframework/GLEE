"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share this round, but I'll try to increase it in future rounds. It's still a good deal for you. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
