Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want to maximize our gains.  I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor this time.  Consider that with each round, the value decreases significantly, especially for you. This is a fair deal considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
