I'm going to offer Bob $1,000 and keep $9,000 for myself.  It's a pretty big advantage, but I'm hoping he'll take it, especially since there's a chance the money will be worth less in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, this offer is still a significant amount of money.  I don't know how much the inflation will affect future rounds, so it's safer to accept this deal and secure a good portion of the money."
