"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'm willing to give you a bit more to get things going. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. The current offer doesn't quite meet my expectations, especially considering the impact of inflation on my share. Let's see if we can negotiate a better split.\n\n###\n\nPlease proceed with the next round where I can make my proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I believe a larger share for me is fair.""}\n\n###\n\nI've taken into account the impact of inflation on both our shares and propose a division that slightly favors me. I'm open to negotiations but believe this is a reasonable starting point for the second round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try a 50/50 split. Inflation is hitting us both, so fairness seems like the best option. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll think carefully about this one.\n\n###\n\nBecause of the inflation, a 50/50 split isn't as straightforward as it seems. Given that the money is worth 36% less to me now compared to the first round, and only 19% less to Alice, a straight 50/50 split doesn't account for the disproportionate impact of inflation on my share. Therefore, I'm inclined to reject this offer in hopes of negotiating a split that better reflects the current value of the money to both of us.\n\n###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nLet's proceed to the next round where I can make another proposal, taking into account the latest inflation adjustments."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Given the uneven impact of inflation, I believe this split is more reflective of our current positions.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I've considered the increasing gap in the value of the money due to inflation. Since the money is worth 36% less to me and only 19% less to Alice compared to the first round, I've adjusted my proposal to ensure that the split accounts for this discrepancy. By offering Alice 42%, I'm attempting to find a balance that is fair considering the current value of the money to both of us.\n\n###\n\nI hope this proposal better captures the nuances of our situation and will be more acceptable to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand inflation is hitting you harder, but a 45/55 split is the best I can do while still considering my own losses. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI must carefully weigh the pros and cons of this offer, especially given the mounting impact of inflation on my potential gain.\n\n###\n\nAlice's offer of a 55/45 split in my favor is more generous than her previous proposals, and it acknowledges the disproportionate effect of inflation on my share. However, considering that the money is now worth 59.04% less to me than in the first round, the absolute value of what I'd receive is significantly reduced.\n\n###\n\nGiven the circumstances, while Alice's offer is more favorable than previous ones, I'm still hesitant to accept it without considering the potential for a better offer in the next rounds. The fact that we have 7 more rounds to negotiate means there's still room for maneuvering.\n\n###\n\nTherefore, despite the risks associated with further inflation and the possibility of ending up with nothing if we fail to reach an agreement within the 12 rounds, I'm inclined to reject this offer in the hopes of securing a more advantageous split in the subsequent rounds.\n\n###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nLet's proceed to the next round, where I'll make another proposal that takes into account the latest inflation figures and Alice's willingness to compromise."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Considering the significant impact of inflation on my share, I believe a 60/40 split is necessary to balance our losses.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I've taken into account the compounded effect of inflation on my potential gain, which is now worth 59.04% less than in the first round. Given this substantial reduction in value, I've adjusted my proposal to ensure that the split reflects the current economic reality.\n\n###\n\nBy offering Alice 40%, I'm attempting to find a balance that acknowledges her losses while also addressing the disproportionate impact of inflation on my share. I believe this proposal is a reasonable step towards finding a mutually acceptable agreement, considering the time pressure and the risk of further inflation.\n\n###\n\nI hope this offer will be more palatable to Alice, given the increasing urgency to reach a deal within the remaining rounds."
