Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly aggressive, but her offers are still heavily skewed in her favor.  It's clear she understands the impact of inflation, but she's hoping I'll crack under pressure. I need to hold my ground a little longer and see if she gets desperate enough to propose a more balanced deal."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical solution. Take it before inflation makes this whole thing pointless.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to play hardball and go for a strong, fair offer. A 50/50 split is objectively the most equitable, and the message emphasizes the urgency of the situation. By now, Alice should realize I'm not budging easily and that accepting this offer is better than risking an even smaller share as inflation worsens."
