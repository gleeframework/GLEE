I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor.  I'm hoping Bob will accept this, as he'll still get a decent amount and it avoids the risk of the money losing value in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob is being greedy! While he's getting a lot more, my gain is worth 20% less than the first round, and his gain is only worth 5% less. I'm going to try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor. While this is less than my first offer, it's still more than Bob's offer, and the inflation will be less impactful on my gain than his. I hope he'll accept this deal and we can end the game."
