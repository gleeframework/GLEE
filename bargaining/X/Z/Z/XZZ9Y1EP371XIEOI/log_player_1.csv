"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

This way, we both get a relatively equal share of the money, and we can proceed with the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, let's meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's compromise is a good one. I'll accept his offer.

```

}
