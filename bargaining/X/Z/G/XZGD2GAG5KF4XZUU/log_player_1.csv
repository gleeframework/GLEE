"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 700000,
""bob_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Let's make a deal where we both benefit, Bob. This offer ensures a significant amount for you right away.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Value of Money:**  The longer the negotiation goes, the less valuable the money becomes, especially for Bob. 
* **Strong Initial Offer:** A 70/30 split in Alice's favor is a strong starting point. It gives Alice a significant advantage while still offering Bob a substantial sum.
* **Encouraging Message:** The message aims to portray the offer as mutually beneficial and encourages Bob to accept to avoid further devaluation of his potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this offer is fairer, considering the inflation factor. We both get a good chunk of the money. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's message tries to frame his offer as fair, it significantly favors him. Accepting this offer would mean settling for less than what was initially offered in Round 1. 

Here's why it's crucial to reject:

* **Leveraging Inflation:** Bob is feeling the pressure of inflation more than Alice. Each round that passes diminishes the value of his potential earnings, making him more likely to accept a less favorable deal in the future.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** Accepting this offer would signal weakness to Bob.  By rejecting it, Alice reiterates her intention to secure a larger portion of the money. 
 
Alice needs to counter with an offer that acknowledges the inflation factor but still keeps her in a strong position for the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 650000,
""bob_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Bob, time is money, and it's literally costing you. Let's settle this now. My new offer still guarantees you a good portion, even considering the inflation.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Inflation:** Alice's message directly addresses the inflation issue, showing Bob she understands his concern.
* **Concession, but with Strength:** Alice reduces her demand from 700,000 to 650,000. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still securing a larger share. 
* **Time Pressure:**  The message subtly reminds Bob that every round lost is a loss in value for him, encouraging him to act quickly. 

This offer aims to strike a balance between being persuasive and maintaining a strong negotiating position."
