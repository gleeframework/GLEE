"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. I think this is a good starting point, and we can adjust as needed in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split in my favor is more fair, considering the inflation will affect you more than me. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's proposal, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'm willing to compromise. However, I'd like to propose a slight adjustment to make it more balanced.

{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""I'm willing to consider a 55-45 split in your favor, but I'd like to counter with a 55-45 split in my favor instead. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was rejected, it's my turn again. Here's my new proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think 52-48 is a fairer split considering the inflation. Let's see if we can find common ground.""}

I'm proposing a 52-48 split, with me getting $5,200 and Bob getting $4,800. I hope this offer is more acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I think 55-45 is a fairer split given the inflation. Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm getting a bit concerned about the inflation eating away at my share! Considering the reduced value of the money, I'm willing to accept Bob's offer, but I'd like to make a slight adjustment.

{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""I accept your offer, but I'd like to counter with a 47.5-52.5 split instead. I think this is a more balanced compromise, but I'm willing to accept 45-55 if you're firm on it.""}

I'm hoping Bob will consider my counteroffer, but if not, I'm willing to accept the 55-45 split."
