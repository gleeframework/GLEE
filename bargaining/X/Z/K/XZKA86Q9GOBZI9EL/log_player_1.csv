Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\nI am offering Bob 40% of the money and keeping 60% for myself. Since the money loses value for me with each passing round, I want to reach an agreement as soon as possible. However, I still want to gain more than Bob, so I am making an offer that I believe is reasonable but still favorable to me.

Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI will accept Bob's offer.

I'm willing to accept this offer and finalize the deal rather than risking further devaluation of the money.\n\n###  \n\nPlease let me know the outcome of my decision and we can conclude the game."
