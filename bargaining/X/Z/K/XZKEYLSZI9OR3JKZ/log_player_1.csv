"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split. This gives me a large share, but also ensures Bob gets something. I want to see if he's willing to accept a deal early on, before the inflation kicks in."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob is now proposing a 10/90 split, which is significantly worse for me than my initial proposal.  I'm not going to accept this. I'll see what I can do in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 810000, ""bob_gain"": 190000}
```

I'm going to try and be a little more generous, but still maintain a large share for myself. My money is worth less now, but Bob's isn't, so I need to offer him a bit more to entice him into accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 190000 
# Bob gain: 810000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly worse for me than my initial proposal, even with the inflation.  I'm not going to accept this and will see what I can do in the next round.  I'm hoping that the inflation will start to impact Bob's decision-making too."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 729000, ""bob_gain"": 271000}
```

I'm going to try offering a slightly smaller amount than the previous round, but still maintain a significant share for myself.  I'm hoping that Bob will realize that we're both losing money with each round and be more willing to accept a reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 271000 
# Bob gain: 729000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly worse for me than my initial proposal, even with the inflation. I'm not going to accept this and will see what I can do in the next round. I'm starting to think Bob might be playing a long game, hoping to push me into accepting something much lower in the later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 656100, ""bob_gain"": 343900}
```

I'm offering a slightly smaller share for myself this time.  The inflation is really hitting hard now, and I'm hoping Bob is starting to feel the pressure too.  We're both losing money with each round, so hopefully he'll see the value in settling for a more reasonable split."
