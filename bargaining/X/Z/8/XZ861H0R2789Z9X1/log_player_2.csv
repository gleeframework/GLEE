**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting desperate and the value of the money is rapidly decreasing for her. We need to push our advantage while we still can."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Final offer: a straight 50/50 split. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to play hardball.  While Alice is feeling the pressure of inflation, dragging this out much longer gives diminishing returns. A 50/50 split is fair and gives a clear ultimatum. This might be our last chance to secure a reasonable amount before Alice's perceived value of the deal drops even further."
