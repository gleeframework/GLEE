"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take the majority""}

I'm proposing that I receive 80% of the total amount, which is $8,000, and Bob receives the remaining 20%, which is $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You said I'd get the minority, now it's my turn to propose a fair split 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not happy about the reduced value of my potential gain due to inflation!

However, I'll consider Bob's offer. Since I was initially offered $8,000 and now I'm being offered $4,000, I've effectively lost $4,000 due to inflation. Bob's offer is still a significant reduction from my original proposal, but I'll have to weigh the options.

I'll decide to...

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a significant reduction from my original proposal, I'll try to make a new offer that's more favorable to me. Here's my new proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""I'll compromise, but I need a bit more""}

I'm proposing that I receive 70% of the total amount, which is $7,000, and Bob receives the remaining 30%, which is $3,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting greedy, I'll give you a bit less 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains!

I'm not thrilled about the reduced value of my potential gain, but I'll consider Bob's offer. Since I was initially offered $8,000 and now I'm being offered $4,500, I've effectively lost $2,500 due to inflation. Bob's offer is still a significant reduction from my original proposal, but I'll have to weigh the options.
