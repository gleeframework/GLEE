"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 70, you take 30. We can end it here.""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount of money, and we can end the game quickly. What do you think, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  It's fair and we can both walk away with a good amount. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less now, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 45
* Bob gain: 45

I think this is a fair offer, and it's a good opportunity to end the game. I accept! 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
