"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

I'm proposing that we split the $1,000,000 evenly, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000. The message is a friendly reminder that this is a fair starting point, and we can negotiate from here if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fairer, considering the inflation. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, the money is worth less, and I need to be more cautious.

I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's still a bit too skewed towards Bob's gain. I'd like to see a more even split.""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and sending a message that I'd like a more balanced split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 5% less again, I'll aim for a slightly larger share to compensate for the decrease in value.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

This offer is a bit more favorable to me, but still a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to go up to 60% for you, but I think the inflation should be reflected in our split. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is catching up quickly!

Considering the significant decrease in the value of the money I'll gain, I think Bob's offer is a reasonable compromise. I'll accept it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, I'll take the 60% share. Thanks for being flexible, Bob!""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer, and we can finalize the split."
