Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable. My offer is fair and it's the last one where I get a decent share. Every round is costing us money due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4900 
# Alice gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'll take my chances in the next round. The inflation is affecting Alice more than me, so I think I can get a better deal."
