"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take the majority""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets the remaining 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's only fair that we each get a majority of the money, since the game is inflating it's value for you more than for me.  How does this sound? 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think it's fair that Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a larger share of the money. I'd like to make a counteroffer that takes into account the changing value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to account for the inflation, it's the fairest way""}

I'm proposing that we split the remaining $100 equally, taking into account the 5% and 20% decreases in value for me and Bob, respectively."
