"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}

This is my first offer. I'm aiming for the vast majority of the money, but I'm giving Bob a tiny amount to hopefully incentivize him to accept, as there's a risk of him getting nothing in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer more, this offer is significantly better than the risk of getting nothing if we go to the next round. The inflation on Bob's side might encourage him to accept more generous offers in the future as well."
