"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you a good deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40, which is a generous 40% of the original $100. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can wrap up the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering we both get a decent amount.  What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $45 is worth 80% of the original $60 I would have gotten in the first round, which is $48.

Considering the offer, I think Bob's gain of $55 is a bit too high, but I'm willing to accept it to avoid further rounds and potential even lower gains due to inflation. I'll accept the offer.
