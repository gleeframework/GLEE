Let's see what Alice offers next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}
```

I'm proposing a 5500/4500 split.  I'm hoping to get a bit more than Alice's offer, but I want to be fair."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even with the inflation, I'm gaining more than the initial round, and I'm not confident I can get a better deal in the next round."
