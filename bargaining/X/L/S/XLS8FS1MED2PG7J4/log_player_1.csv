"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split in my favor, but I'm being generous to start with a fair split. Will Bob accept?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $50 in this round is equivalent to $40 in the first round.

I'll think about Bob's offer... Meeting in the middle sounds reasonable, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject the offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect, my gain of $60 in this round is equivalent to $48 in the first round.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more!""
}
```

I'm increasing my gain slightly, but still leaving room for Bob to negotiate. Will he accept?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $40 in this round is equivalent to $20.80 in the first round, which is a significant decrease.

Bob's offer is a bit more aggressive, but I'm not sure if I want to give him the majority of the money. I'll think about it...

I'll reject the offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

I'm increasing my gain slightly, but still trying to find a balance. Will Bob accept this offer?"
