Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

 I propose a very simple division, where I get almost all the money, leaving just $1 for Bob. This is a very aggressive opening move. If Bob rejects it, he knows I'm not afraid to take most of the money. Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a fair offer. It's better than getting nothing in the last round! I'll accept it."
