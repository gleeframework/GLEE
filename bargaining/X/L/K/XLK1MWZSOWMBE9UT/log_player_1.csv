Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This way, I get the majority of the money, but still leave Bob with a significant amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less in the second round, I need to make a more aggressive offer to compensate for the inflation. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I want to get more money in the second round to account for the inflation."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In the third round, the money I gain is worth 40% less than in the first round. I'll make a more aggressive offer to compensate for the inflation. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

I'm trying to get a larger share of the money to account for the increasing inflation."

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings. Since the money I gain is worth significantly less in the fourth round, I'll consider Bob's offer. However, I still want to get a better deal to account for the remaining rounds. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than 45% of the original amount, considering the remaining rounds and the decreasing value of money."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","The money I gain is worth 61.44% less than in the first round. I'll make a very aggressive offer to try to get a significant share of the remaining money. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm taking a risk by offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm hoping to get a better deal in the remaining rounds."

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really eating away at my potential earnings. With the money I gain being worth only 32.77% of its original value, I need to be extremely cautious. Bob's offer is actually a decent one, considering the circumstances. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer, as it's a reasonable deal given the rapidly decreasing value of the money."
