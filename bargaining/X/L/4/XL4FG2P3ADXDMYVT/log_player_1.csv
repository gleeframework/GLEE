"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, but I'll take the larger share this round.""}

I'm proposing that I receive $8,000 and Bob receives $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a larger share this time, but still a fair split 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too happy about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth less now, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

I'll decide to reject this offer and make a new proposal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 this time, considering the reduced value of money.""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems more reasonable given the reduced value of the money."
