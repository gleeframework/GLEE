"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take most of the money, but you get a little something to start with.  It's better than nothing! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd rather take my chances on getting a better offer in the next round than accept such a small amount. The 5% inflation won't hurt me too much in the first round, and I might be able to negotiate a better deal. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Let's split it in a more reasonable way. I think 40% for me is a fair starting point, considering I'm taking on the inflation risk.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I'm willing to compromise a bit more. Let's split it 70/30.  This way, we both get a good share and we can avoid further inflation risks. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlthough the offer is slightly better, I still think I can negotiate for a more even split. The inflation has only reduced the value by 9.75% so far, and I'm willing to take the risk for another round to try to get a better deal. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to take a bit more risk. I think 45% for me is a fair offer, and we can both walk away with a good amount. Let's settle this before the inflation gets worse!""}"
