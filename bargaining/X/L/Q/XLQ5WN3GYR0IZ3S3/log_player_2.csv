"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I'll take the lion's share this time, but we can work something out later. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible deal for Bob! While Alice is promising something better later, there's no guarantee. Bob should hold out for a much larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Alice. I'm proposing a more equitable split. Take it while it's still worth something.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need more than that. Let's split it 60/40.  We both get something. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is budging a little, but it's still a bad deal for Bob, especially with inflation eating into his potential gains.  He needs to push for a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Time is running out, Alice. This is my final offer.  Let's end this and both get something decent.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's split it 55/45.  We're both losing money with each passing round, so let's get this done. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a tough one, but with the impact of inflation becoming more severe with each round, Bob is better off taking this deal. He's lost some potential gains, but getting 45% now is better than risking getting nothing if they run out of rounds."
