7000.0,3000.0,I propose dividing the money with a 70/30 split in favor of Alice. I believe this is fair considering the risk of inflation in future rounds.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share now to avoid a bigger loss in future rounds. Let's split it 60/40 in my favor.,Bob,2,
