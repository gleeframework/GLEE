Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the difference. I'll take 90% and you get 10%. It's a fair compromise. 
# Bob gain: 100000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a little more.  Let's split it 80/20, it's a better deal for you than before. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is moving in the right direction, we still have eight rounds left. Holding out for a more equitable split (e.g., 60/40 or even 50/50) is still possible as the pressure of the dwindling rounds comes into play."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""We're getting close, Alice.  Let's settle this fairly - 60/40 seems like a reasonable compromise.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet halfway.  700k for me, 300k for you.  We're getting closer to a deal. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**  Alice is getting closer to an even split, and the pressure is on with only 5 rounds left.  Holding out for an even better offer (like 60/40) is still a good strategy."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Time is running out Alice.  55/45 is my final offer. Let's close this deal and avoid going home empty-handed.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm making a final concession. 650k for me, 350k for you.  Let's end this game with a compromise. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**  With only 3 rounds left, the risk of walking away with nothing is very high. Alice is unlikely to offer a better deal at this point. Accepting the 35/65 split ensures Bob gets a decent share, even if it's not an ideal split."
