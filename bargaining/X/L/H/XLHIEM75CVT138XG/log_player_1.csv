"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

This means I'm proposing that I get $70 and Bob gets $30."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering we're both taking a hit from inflation. Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

Considering the new proposal, I think a 60/40 split is indeed more favorable to Bob, considering the inflation. I'll have to accept this offer to get something out of the deal.
