"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

This is a pretty aggressive offer, but I want to see if Bob is willing to accept a smaller share early on. It's risky, but if he rejects, I can adjust my offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is a complete reversal of mine, and even though I'm losing 10% of my value with each round, it's still too early to accept such a lopsided deal. I'll counter with a more balanced proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
``` 

This is a more balanced offer than the first round, reflecting the fact that the money is losing value. I'm still aiming for a larger share, but I'm willing to compromise to avoid ending up with nothing."
