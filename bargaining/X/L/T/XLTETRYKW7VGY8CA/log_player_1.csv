"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, it's fair and simple.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, my gain of $4000 is now worth 95% of the original $5000, which is $4750. Bob's gain of $6000 is now worth 90% of the original $5000, which is $5400.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this offer, as it seems like Bob is getting a slightly better deal than me. I'll reject it.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, my gain will be worth even less than before. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I think this is a fair compromise.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, hoping to make the deal more appealing to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I think this is my best offer. You're not getting a better deal elsewhere! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation effect:

My gain of $3000 is worth 95% of the original $5000, which is $4750, and then 85.86% of that, which is $4093. My gain is worth 81.86% of the original $5000, which is $4093.

Bob's gain of $7000 is worth 90% of the original $5000, which is $4500, and then 72.9% of that, which is $3279. Bob's gain is worth 65.8% of the original $5000, which is $3279.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this offer, as it seems like Bob is getting a larger share than me, and it's not clear that I'm getting the best deal possible. I'll reject it.
