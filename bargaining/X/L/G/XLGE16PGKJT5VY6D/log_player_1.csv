"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This offer gives me a large share, but still leaves Bob with something, making it more likely he'll accept in the first round. It avoids creating unnecessary rounds, and since the money depreciates faster for Bob, it's a good strategy for me in the long run."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I initially wanted a larger share, Bob's offer is a fair split, and the risk of him getting a larger share in the next round due to inflation makes this a good option."
