"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, which is a generous 30% of the initial amount. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject my offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's compromise! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $500,000 is now worth $475,000 (95% of $500,000).

I'm not too thrilled about the compromise, but it's a decent offer. I'll consider it. However, I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected the previous offer, I'll try to make a stronger move this time. I'll aim to get a better deal.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting the better end of the deal if you don't take this!""
}
```

This time, I'm offering Bob $450,000, which is a slightly smaller share, but I'm hoping it's more appealing than the 50/50 split he proposed earlier."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting a bit greedy, aren't you? 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is catching up with me! My gain of $400,000 is now worth $342,800 (95% * 95% * 95% * 95% * 95% * 95% * 95% * 95% * 95% * 95% * 95% * 95% * 0.926 * 400000 = 342800).

I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but it's a decent compromise. I'm not sure if I can do better, and I don't want to risk going into the next round with an even smaller share.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
