Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a fairly generous offer, hoping Bob will accept it.  It seems like a good strategy to secure a larger share early on, especially since we don't know how the inflation affects him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being incredibly greedy!  I'm not going to accept this offer, I can do better than $1,000. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a slightly smaller share than before, but still a significant amount. Hopefully, he'll realize that rejecting my offer again will leave him with even less in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is still bad, but the inflation is hurting me more than him.  I'm going to take the $2,000, as the next round will be even worse for me. I'm not happy about it, but I'm accepting."
