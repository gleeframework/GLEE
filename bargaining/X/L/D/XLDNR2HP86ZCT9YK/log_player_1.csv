"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

This is a fair and equal split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it to avoid any further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my share is now worth less, so I need to be more aggressive in my negotiation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer was 40% for me, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. I'll offer a bit less to Bob, but still a significant amount.

```
{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}
```

This way, I'll get a slightly larger share, but still leave room for Bob to accept and end the game."
