"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money in an 8:2 ratio. This allows for a fair share while also securing a significant portion for myself.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a decent share, but I think 8:2 is too generous. I'm proposing a 6:4 split, which is still fair but slightly more balanced. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
