Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I think it's only fair I get a bit more. This is my counteroffer. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You may be losing value due to inflation, but I'm not getting any more patient. This is my new offer. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"",
""message"": ""This offer is getting worse for me with each round.  I need you to consider the impact of inflation more seriously if we want to reach an agreement.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is taking advantage of my weakening position due to inflation but isn't offering anything substantial in return.  It's important to remain firm and make it clear that his current strategy won't lead to a deal. I'm hoping this will push him to negotiate more fairly in the next round."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""bob_gain"": 5200,
""message"": ""Bob, it's clear we both want to reach a deal. This is my final offer - it's a compromise that recognizes the impact of inflation while still giving you a slight advantage. Let's end this here.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time for a more assertive approach. By framing this as my ""final offer"" and highlighting its fairness despite the inflation, I'm increasing the pressure on Bob. This offer is still reasonable for him, but makes it clear I'm not willing to accept increasingly worse deals."
