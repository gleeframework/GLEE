"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making an aggressive offer. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}

This way, I get the majority of the money, but it's still a decent offer for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""accept""}

It's a relatively fair split, and I don't want to risk going into more rounds with the decreasing value of money."
