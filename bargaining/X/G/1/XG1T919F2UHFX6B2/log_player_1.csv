"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, then we can negotiate further if needed.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fair, given we both get less with each round. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation affecting Bob's gain, I'll have to adjust my decision accordingly.

I accept Bob's offer from Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think the 45-55 split is a fair compromise, considering the effects of inflation."
