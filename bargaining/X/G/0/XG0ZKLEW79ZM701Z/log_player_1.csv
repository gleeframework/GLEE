"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 90% of the initial amount, and Bob will get 10%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this generous offer and we can wrap up the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's time we split the money more evenly. This is a fair offer. Accept it and we both get a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is quite one-sided this time!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not going to accept this offer, as I'll be getting only 10% of the remaining amount, which is worth 10% less than in the first round due to inflation. I'd like to propose a new offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation. This is a fair split.""
}
```

I'm trying to get a bigger share, but I'm still being reasonable, considering the inflation factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a decent portion, but I need a significant share to make this worth it. This is my final offer before we both start losing even more money. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation taking a bigger hit, I need to be more cautious. Bob's offer is still a bit one-sided, but I'm running out of time.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. 400,000 is better than risking losing more money in the next rounds."
