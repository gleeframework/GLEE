Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm taking a very aggressive approach here. I'm offering Bob a tiny amount, hoping he'll accept it just to get something.  Since I don't know how inflation affects Bob, I'm trying to secure the maximum for myself in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

I accept Bob's offer. While I would have preferred to get more, it's better to secure half of the money than risk getting nothing in later rounds. The inflation factor makes it less appealing to keep rejecting offers, as the potential gain may not be worth the risk."
