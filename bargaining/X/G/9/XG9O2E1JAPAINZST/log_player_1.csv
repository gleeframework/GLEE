"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. We can always negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I can do better than that. What about this? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this new proposal. Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'm not concerned about the inflation effect on my end. However, Bob's gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, so I need to take that into account.

Considering the new proposal, I'm still not getting as much as I wanted, but it's a better offer than the previous one. I'll decide to reject this offer and hope to get a better deal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's now my turn again. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Can we meet in the middle?""
}
```

I'm increasing my gain to $6,000, which is a 20% increase from the $5,000 I initially proposed. This should give me a slightly better share, considering the inflation effect on Bob's gain. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to give up that much, but I'm willing to meet you halfway on the compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's new proposal. Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'm not concerned about the inflation effect on my end. However, Bob's gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, which is a significant decrease.

Considering the new proposal, I'm getting a slightly smaller share than I wanted, but it's still a decent compromise. I'll decide to accept this offer, as I don't want to risk waiting for a potentially worse deal in the next round.
