I'm going to start with a pretty aggressive offer. I'm taking the majority, but I'm still leaving Bob with a decent amount. I want to see if he's willing to accept right away, or if he's going to try to negotiate more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob is trying to play the same game I did, but he's already got the upper hand because of inflation.  I'm not going to accept this.  Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

I'm lowering my demand, but still taking the majority. Bob's last offer was too aggressive, and I think this offer shows that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not going to give in completely.  Let's see if he's willing to meet me halfway."
