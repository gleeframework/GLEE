"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! Take the smaller share, it's a fair start.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. This way, I'm showing that I'm willing to compromise and give Bob a decent share, but also keeping a significant amount for myself. The message is just a friendly nudge to get the game started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but still leaving you with a decent amount 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to adjust my strategy.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about giving up such a large share, but I don't want to risk going into the next round with less value. I'll accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
