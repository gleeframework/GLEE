"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

I'm offering Bob $20, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I need to be more aggressive. I reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation and the fact that Bob was offering me 40 in the previous round, I'll try to make a stronger offer. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
