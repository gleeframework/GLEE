"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a good foundation""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I get 600,000 and Bob gets 400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script, I'm offering you a fair split.  I'm sure we can work something out. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since Bob's offer is to give me 400,000, which is less than my initial proposal, I'm not too thrilled about it. However, I don't want to reject the offer and risk getting an even worse deal in the next round. Considering the inflation, I'll accept Bob's offer this time.
