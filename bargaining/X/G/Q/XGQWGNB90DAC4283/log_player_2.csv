Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Your offer was a bit unfair, Alice.  Let's be reasonable, I'll take 70 and you take 30 before inflation eats away at your share.""}

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I understand your perspective.  Let's try a 40/60 split this time. I'm willing to be more flexible, but I need to make sure I get a decent share before the inflation kicks in too much. 
# Bob gain: 60 
# Alice gain: 40
