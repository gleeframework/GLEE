Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit unfair, Alice.  Let's be reasonable, I'll take 70 and you take 30 before inflation eats away at your share. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
