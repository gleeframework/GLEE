"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

This way, I get 60% of the original $100, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, but I'll stick to my original strategy. I'll reject this offer.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll aim for a higher percentage of the original amount:

```
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

This way, I get a larger share of the original $100, but Bob gets a smaller share due to the effects of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth less for Bob, I'll take a closer look at the offer. Since I still get a decent share of the original amount, I'll accept this offer.
