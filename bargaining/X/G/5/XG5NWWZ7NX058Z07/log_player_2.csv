Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a proposal for Round 2. Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, the effective amount is 8,000$. Here's my offer:

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the effective amount is now 64% of the original 10,000$, which is 6,400$. My gain would be 40% of 6,400$, which is 2,560$. Alice's gain would be 60% of 6,400$, which is 3,840$. I'll accept this offer.
