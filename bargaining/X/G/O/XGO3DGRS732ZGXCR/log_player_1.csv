"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting 60 dollars and Bob getting 40 dollars. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started with 60, I'll take the lead! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't like the 40-60 split. I was hoping for a more balanced division.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'll try to meet you in the middle, Bob. Let's compromise!""}

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than Bob's previous offer, but still a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were 5 more, now I'll take 5 more 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my gains!

I'm not thrilled about the 45-55 split, but I'm running out of options. I'll accept Bob's offer this time.
