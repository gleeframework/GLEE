"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a fair split, considering you'll be getting a larger share in the future due to the inflation.  Let's get this over with! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm Bob, and I'm not going to accept a deal where I get only 1000!  I'll see what Alice offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""This is a fair split considering the inflation. I'm willing to negotiate further, but let's try to reach an agreement quickly.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a larger share to make this worth my time. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share,  the inflation is working against me.  Accepting this offer is the best way to secure some money before the value diminishes further."
