Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, it's fair!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we each get $500,000."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60/40 is a fairer split, considering the inflation rates we are facing. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not convinced by Bob's proposal. I think I can do better.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new proposal. Since Bob was willing to consider a 60/40 split, I'll offer a slightly more favorable split to Bob, but still keep a significant portion for myself.

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still want a decent chunk of the pie""}

Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this offer!"
