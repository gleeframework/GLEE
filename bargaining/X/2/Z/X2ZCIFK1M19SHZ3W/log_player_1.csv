"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money 3:1, I'll take the smaller share this round.""
}
```

I'm starting with a generous offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority this round, but willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking its toll!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'd rather not accept this offer. If I take 400,000 now, it's equivalent to 320,000 in the first round, which is still a significant amount. I'd like to negotiate further to get a better deal.

```

  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a bit more this round, but still willing to compromise.""

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'd rather not accept this offer. If I take 460,000 now, it's equivalent to about 230,000 in the first round, which is a relatively small amount. I'd like to negotiate further to get a better deal.

}

I'm trying to be more aggressive in my offer, given the rapid inflation and the limited time left in the game. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer to avoid a worse deal later on."

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'd rather not accept this offer. If I take 580,000 now, it's equivalent to about 90,000 in the first round, which is a very small amount. I'd like to negotiate further to get a better deal, but I'm starting to run out of time.

}
```

I'm being very aggressive in my offer now, taking a large share of the remaining money. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer to avoid getting nothing, but I'm not sure if he'll be willing to give up so much."

# Alice gain: 760000 
# Bob gain: 240000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really ravaging the value of the money now!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'd rather not accept this offer. If I take 760,000 now, it's equivalent to about 20,000 in the first round, which is almost nothing. I'd like to negotiate further to get a better deal, but I'm starting to think that accepting this offer might be the best option to avoid getting nothing.

# Alice gain: 990000 
# Bob gain: 10000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation has almost completely ravaged the value of the money!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'd rather not accept this offer. If I take 990,000 now, it's equivalent to about 10,000 in the first round, which is essentially nothing. However, I also don't want to leave the table with nothing, so I'll accept this offer to get a tiny fraction of the original amount.
