"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer or proceed to the next round.

After some thought, I decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Inflation is eating away at the value of the money, so I'll have to be strategic with my next offer. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $450,000 and keeping $550,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is taking a toll on the money's value. Considering the reduced value, Bob's offer is actually a better deal than my previous offer, but I still have to think about it carefully.

However, I'm not sure if I should accept this offer or try to negotiate further. I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","The game continues!

With the value of money continuing to decrease, I'll have to be even more strategic with my next offer. Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm offering Bob an equal split, $500,000 each."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is plummeting!

Wait, what? Bob's offer is the same as mine from Round 5? I think I'll take advantage of this coincidence. Since the value of money is decreasing, I'd rather accept the offer now than risk waiting for another round. I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```"
