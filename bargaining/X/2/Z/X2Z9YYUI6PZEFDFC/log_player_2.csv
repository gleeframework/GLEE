"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I'll take the lion's share but give you a decent chunk. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While it's tempting to take $100,000, it's much too early in the game to accept such a small portion.  Rejecting will give Bob the opportunity to make a counter-offer in the next round and potentially secure a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to split the money more evenly. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a larger share to make this worthwhile. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is better than the previous round, the inflation penalty is starting to bite.  Bob should continue to hold out for a more equitable split.  Rejecting will allow him to make a counter-offer in the next round and hopefully secure a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I'm still willing to split the money fairly, but we need to find a compromise that works for both of us. Let's meet in the middle.""}
