"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take the lowball, it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is already taking a bite out of my potential earnings!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully. If I accept, I'll get $2,000, which is worth 95% of $2,200 (5% less than $2,333.33, which is 50% of $4,666.67, the new total value of the $10,000).

I'm not sure if it's a good deal, but I'll take the lowball offer for now.
