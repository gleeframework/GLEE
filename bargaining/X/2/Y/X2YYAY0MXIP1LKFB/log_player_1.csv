"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Fair start, let's split it 7:3""}

I'm proposing a 7:3 split, where I get 700,000 and Bob gets 300,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm happy to split it 6:4 in your favor, as a gesture of goodwill, knowing that the money depreciates faster for you. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I appreciate Bob's gesture, but I'm not willing to accept a 4:6 split, even if it's in my favor. I'm hoping to get a better deal, considering the money is depreciating faster for me. I'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, let's split it 55:45""}

I'm adjusting my proposal to a 55:45 split, which is a bit more favorable to Bob, but still gives me a decent share. I'm hoping Bob will consider this offer and accept it."
