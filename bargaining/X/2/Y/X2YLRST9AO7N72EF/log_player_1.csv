I propose you get $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000. This gives me a good starting point, and hopefully, Bob will find it acceptable."

I'm going to lower my offer to $800,000 for me and $200,000 for Bob.  While I'm losing value with each round, I need to ensure I get a significant share.  Let's see if Bob is willing to compromise a little."

I'm going to try to make another compromise.  I'm willing to reduce my share to $700,000, giving Bob $300,000. This is getting risky, but I need to secure a deal before the inflation hits me too hard."
