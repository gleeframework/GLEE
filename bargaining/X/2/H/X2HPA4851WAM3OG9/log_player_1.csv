"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

This is a risky move, but I'm aiming to secure most of the money early on. I'll see if Bob is willing to accept such a lopsided offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I would have liked to get more, it's clear that Bob is unwilling to accept a large imbalance in the split. Accepting this offer guarantees me a decent amount, and with inflation affecting Bob more, there's no guarantee that a later offer will be better."
