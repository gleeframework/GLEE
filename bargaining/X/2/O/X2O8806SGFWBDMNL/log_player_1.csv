"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\nI'm offering Bob 40 dollars, which is a generous offer considering I could try to take more. The message ""Let's split fairly"" is to convey a sense of cooperation and fairness, in the hopes that Bob will accept the offer and we can both walk away satisfied."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable, Alice. This is a better deal for both of us before inflation eats away at it. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe I can get a better deal, even considering the inflation. Since the money is worth 20% less in this round, Bob's offer of 45 dollars is actually worth less than it would have been in the first round. I'm willing to take the risk of proceeding to the next round to try to get a more favorable offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Last chance before it's worthless""}\n\nIn this round, I'm offering Bob 42 dollars, which is still a relatively generous offer considering the decreasing value of the money. My message ""Last chance before it's worthless"" is meant to convey a sense of urgency and pressure Bob into accepting the offer, as the money will continue to lose value in subsequent rounds. I'm trying to make Bob believe that this is the best deal he'll get before the money becomes nearly worthless."
