"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving each of us $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take a smaller share, let's move on! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since my gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll need to consider that when making my decision.

In this offer, I would gain $400,000, which is 40% of the total amount. Considering the inflation, this is actually a relatively good deal for me.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now.
