Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 65/35 split is more fair, considering the inflation we need to factor in. Let's get this done!

# Bob gain: 65

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Bob gain: 55

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to meet you in the middle.  A 60/40 split is fair given the circumstances. Let's settle this now. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is still a bad deal for Alice.  While Bob is offering a ""middle ground,"" it doesn't account for the significant impact of inflation on Alice's share. It's crucial to remain firm and make Bob understand that a fair deal requires acknowledging the diminishing value of Alice's potential gain."
