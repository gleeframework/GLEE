"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This is a pretty standard 60-40 split, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it quickly so we can start with a clean slate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is trying to flip the script! With the inflation affecting Bob's gain, I think I can do better than this. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a better deal for myself.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's gain is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll try to take advantage of that. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

This way, I'm still getting a slight majority of the money, but I'm giving Bob a bit more than in my initial offer to try to get him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, inflation is really taking a toll on Bob's gain! With the money I gain still being worth the same as in the first round, I think I can do better than this. I'll reject the offer and try to get a better deal.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'll try to take advantage of that. I'll make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal for myself.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

This way, I'm getting a larger share of the money, but I'm still leaving Bob with something. We're getting close to the end, and I think I can get a good deal this round."
