Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Alice's offer was quite lopsided, I'll try to make a more balanced offer. Considering the 20% inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher share.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a bite out of my potential gain. However, this offer is a 50/50 split, which is a fair one. Considering the rapidly decreasing value of my potential gain, I think it's time to consider accepting a fair split.
