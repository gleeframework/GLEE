"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can split the remaining 10% of the original amount in a more equitable way in the next round!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, keeping $900,000 for myself, and suggesting that we revisit the division in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take this, you'll be lucky to get anything better! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, looks like Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation!

Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to be careful. Since my gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 5% less, I'll think carefully before accepting.

For now, I'll reject this offer and wait for a better proposal from Bob.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll adjust my proposal accordingly.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 720000,
  ""bob_gain"": 280000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting desperate, Bob! This is a fair offer, don't make me go lower!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $280,000, keeping $720,000 for myself, and hoping he'll accept this more generous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not getting the better end of this deal, Alice. I'm being generous. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, it seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation even more!

Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since my gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 14.26% less, I'll need to be cautious.

However, Bob's offer is actually a bit more generous than my previous offer, and I don't want to risk getting an even worse deal in the next round.

For now, I'll accept this offer, hoping it's the best I can get.
