I'm starting with a very generous offer to Bob. I'm hoping this will encourage him to accept and end the game quickly.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob's offer is much worse for me, even with the inflation factored in. I'm willing to take the risk and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm lowering my offer slightly to 900,000 for me and 100,000 for Bob.  I still think this is a fair split, and I'm hoping Bob will see that as well."
