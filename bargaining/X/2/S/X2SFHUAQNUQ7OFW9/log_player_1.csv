Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

**My Proposal:**

I propose that I receive $900,000, and Bob receives $100,000. 

**Rationale:**

I'm aiming for a large share in the first round, knowing that inflation will devalue the money in subsequent rounds. I'm also leaving Bob with a reasonable amount to make the offer seem fair."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

**My Proposal:**

I propose that I receive $600,000 and Bob receives $400,000.

**Rationale:**

Even though my offer from the first round was rejected, I'm still aiming for a significant share. I'm decreasing my share slightly, but I believe this offer is still fair, considering that I now have control over the proposal. I need to maintain a balance between securing a good amount for myself and ensuring Bob doesn't get too greedy."
