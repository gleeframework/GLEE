  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money in an 80/20 ratio, with me receiving $8000 and you receiving $2000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I like the 80/20 ratio. Let's split it down the middle for now. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
