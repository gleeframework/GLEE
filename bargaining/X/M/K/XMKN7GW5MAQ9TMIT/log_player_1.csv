I'm starting with a very generous offer, hoping Bob will accept it and we can both get the most money possible!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

It's a fair offer, and the inflation will only continue to eat away at my potential gains. Accepting is the best option for me right now."
