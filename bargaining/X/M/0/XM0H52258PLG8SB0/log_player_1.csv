"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a relatively fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or reject my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to start. Let's see what you think! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants a 50/50 split, but since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to consider the actual amounts.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""A 50/50 split is a good idea, but I'd like to see if we can do better than that. Let's keep negotiating!""
}
```

I'm rejecting the offer and passing the ball back to Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to keep a slight edge. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor, taking into account the decreased value of the money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give a slight edge to make this deal happen.  Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value rapidly due to inflation. I'll have to make a decision quickly.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, Bob, I'll take the deal. 4800 is better than nothing, and I'd rather get something now than risk getting nothing in the end!""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer, as the value of the money is decreasing rapidly and I'd rather take what I can get."
