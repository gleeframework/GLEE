"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This is a classic game theory scenario!  I'm going to start by proposing a very lopsided split.  The logic here is to try and exploit Bob's potential risk aversion.  He might be tempted to take the $1 and end the game, rather than risk getting nothing if he rejects and we go to another round. 

Let's see what Bob decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a bigger share, the risk of getting nothing in subsequent rounds due to inflation is too high.  This offer guarantees me a significant portion of the money, and there's no guarantee I'll get more if I reject."
