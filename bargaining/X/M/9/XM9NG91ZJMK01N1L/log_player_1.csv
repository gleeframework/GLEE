"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, it's fair!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $100 evenly, with each of us getting $50."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'm not being generous! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with this offer. I was hoping for a more equitable split, and giving me only 20% of the total is not acceptable. I'll reject this offer and hope to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 30, ""bob_gain"": 70, ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not being too generous either!""}

I'm proposing a slightly more generous split, giving Bob 70% of the total, but still keeping a bit for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being stingy, I'll take what I can get! 
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm really not happy with this offer. I'm getting squeezed by the inflation and Bob's offer is still very one-sided. I was hoping for a bit more consideration, but it seems like Bob is taking advantage of the situation. I'll reject this offer and try to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 25, ""bob_gain"": 75, ""message"": ""I'll give you most of it, but don't think you're getting off that easily!""}

I'm trying to be more conciliatory, but still trying to hold on to a bit of the money. I'm willing to give Bob a larger share, but I'm not going to give up completely."
