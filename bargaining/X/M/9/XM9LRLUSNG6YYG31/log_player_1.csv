"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping to get a good deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me, I need to consider the actual amount I'll be getting in real terms. In the first round, I offered Bob $2,000, which is now worth 80% of its original value, so it's $1,600 in real terms.

In this round, Bob is offering me $5,000, which is worth 80% of its original value, so it's $4,000 in real terms.

Considering the offer, I think I'll accept this deal.
