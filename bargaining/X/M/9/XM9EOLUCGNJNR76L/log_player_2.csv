"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer saves us both time and gets us a decent amount. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to rush.""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn, Alice!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my friend, let's be practical.  This offer is still fair, and time is money! You lose more with every round. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll take my chances in the next round. The loss due to inflation isn't severe enough to accept an offer that's still not as fair as I'd like."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still believe a closer split is more reasonable.""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn, Alice!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Take this offer and let's be done with it.  Any more delays and you'll be getting even less. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nGiven the increasing impact of inflation, accepting this offer seems the most prudent decision at this point. Further delays would only decrease the value of my gain, making this offer more reasonable compared to potential future offers."
