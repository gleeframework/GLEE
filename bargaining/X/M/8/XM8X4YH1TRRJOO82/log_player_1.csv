"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm offering to give myself $8,000 and Bob $2,000. This way, I get the majority of the money, but still give Bob a decent amount to keep him interested in negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $7,000 is now worth less than I initially thought, and Bob's gain of $3,000 is also less valuable to him than it was in the first round.

I'll reject this offer and try to do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the inflation and trying to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering myself $6,000 and Bob $4,000, hoping that Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game."
