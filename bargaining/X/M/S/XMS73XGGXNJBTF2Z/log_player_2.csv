"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the $100 with an 80/20 split in favor of you, Bob. This might seem like a generous offer considering the potential inflation, but remember, the value of money decreases by 20% with each round. 
# Bob gain: 20 
# Alice gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
