Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

It's still slightly in Alice's favor, but the effects of inflation are starting to add up. Accepting this offer now guarantees I get something, and it's close enough to a fair split.
