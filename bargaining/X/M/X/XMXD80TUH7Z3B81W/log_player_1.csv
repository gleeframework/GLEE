"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000 and leave 40% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to adjust my strategy considering the inflation.

Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, and Bob's offer is to give me 40% of the original amount, but I'll actually get 40% of the original amount that's worth 20% less. So, I'll get 40% of 0.8 (since 100% - 20% = 80% of the original value) of the original amount, which is 320,000.

In contrast, Bob's offer is to give me 400,000, which is worth 80% of the original amount, which is 800,000.

Considering this, I'll reject the offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 20% less than the previous round, I'll aim to get a larger share to account for the decrease in value.

I'll offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm offering to take 55% of the original $1,000,000, which is a bit more than my initial offer, but considering the inflation, I'm hoping it's a more reasonable proposal."
