"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose to keep $90 and give Bob $10.  This seems like a fair starting point, as I am taking the larger share.  However, I am willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer. While I am getting a larger share now, the inflation means that Bob's gain is worth less.  I think I can still negotiate a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}

Round 4

# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to an equal split, the inflation means that his gain is worth significantly less than what I initially proposed.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I believe I can still get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
