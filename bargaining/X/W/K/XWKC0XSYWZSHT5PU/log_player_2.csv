Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable - a 50/50 split is the fairest way to divide the remaining value. We've both lost some due to inflation, so let's just split it evenly and call it a day. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
