"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it closer to 50/50. This way we both get a decent share, and we can avoid further rounds. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
