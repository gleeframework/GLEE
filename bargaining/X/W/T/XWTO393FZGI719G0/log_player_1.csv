I'm going to start with a very high offer for myself, but I'll give Bob a small amount to hopefully entice him to accept.  Since there are 12 rounds and the value of money decreases with each round, I want to secure as much as I can early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob is being very greedy! I'll take my chances and see if I can get a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

I'm going to offer Bob a bit more than last round, but I'm still aiming for the majority of the money.  It's risky, but I think it's worth trying to get a better deal than Bob's initial offer."
