"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to be greedy and propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor.  I figure Bob might accept this, but if not, I'll be in a good position to negotiate in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer. Even though it's a significant amount of money, I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round.  Bob is clearly feeling the pressure of inflation, and I'm in a good position to leverage that."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm going to offer a 7000/3000 split. Bob is probably getting desperate now with the inflation, so I think this is a reasonable compromise that he might accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm going to accept this offer.  Bob's offer is not ideal, but the inflation is clearly taking a toll on him and I don't think I can get a better deal in the next round.  This is a decent amount of money and I don't want to risk losing it all."
