"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer.  I'm willing to give you 10% of the money, but I need most of it to start building my fortune.  Let's see what you think. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While 100,000$ is a decent start, I believe I can get a better deal. I'll wait and see what Alice proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm offering a 60/40 split.  It's a fair deal considering the inflation we're both facing.  Let's get this done before the money becomes worthless!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but a 60/40 split is too much in your favor.  I'm offering 70/30, which is still a significant gain for you considering inflation. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While a 70/30 split is better than nothing, I believe I can still get a better deal.  I'm not ready to accept yet."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""We're both losing money with each passing round. Let's be reasonable and split the money evenly. It's the best outcome for both of us.""}
