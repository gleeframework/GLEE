"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $1000, and I'll take $9000.""
}
```

I'm starting with a generous offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, Alice. 50/50 split seems fair. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 5% inflation, my gain is now worth less than I initially thought. I'll have to be more careful.

Considering Bob's offer, I think a 50/50 split is a reasonable compromise. However, I'm not sure if I'm getting the better deal considering the inflation.

I'll reject this offer and wait for the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, so I'll need to adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7200,
  ""bob_gain"": 2800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I still think I deserve more. This is my best offer so far.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a good share and ending the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think I deserve a bigger share. This is my best offer so far. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on my potential earnings! With the money being worth 14.26% less than the original $10,000, I need to be more cautious.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal. I was hoping for a bit more, but I don't want to risk going to the next round and losing even more value.

I'll accept this offer, hoping it's the best I can get.
