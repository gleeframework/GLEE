"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor. Since I get to make the first offer, I'm going to try and secure a large portion of the money.  Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation!  I'm not going to accept such a low offer. I'll try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to stick with a high offer, but lower it slightly to see if I can find a compromise.  I'm still hoping to get a large share, but I'm willing to negotiate a bit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is the best deal I'm likely to get!  Bob is getting a larger share because of the inflation, but I'm still getting a significant amount of money.  I'm not going to risk getting nothing by rejecting this offer."
