"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my first offer. I propose we split the money 6000 for me and 4000 for you. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'll reject this offer. I'm not sure how the inflation will affect Alice, so it's worth trying to negotiate a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is a fair starting point. Let's see if we can work something out.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I propose a 55/45 split, with you receiving $4500 and me receiving $5500. This maintains fairness while accounting for the diminishing value of money. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice's offer is fair considering the inflation.  It's better than my previous offer, and it's a good deal for me."
