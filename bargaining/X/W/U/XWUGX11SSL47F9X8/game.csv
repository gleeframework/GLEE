600000.0,400000.0,Let's start with a simple 60/40 split.  It's a good deal for both of us to avoid the money shrinking.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"I think a 60/40 split is fair, but I'd prefer to be the one getting the larger share this time. Let's see if you agree.",Bob,2,
,,"While I understand your perspective, Bob, starting with a 50/50 split seems much fairer given the risk of inflation for both of us.",Alice,2,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, I'm aiming for a fair deal. How about a 55/45 split?  It's closer to the middle ground and still a good amount before inflation eats away at it further.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 55/45, with me getting the larger share.  It's a fair offer, and we can avoid further losses from inflation.",Bob,4,
,,"Bob, we're just going in circles now.  I proposed 55/45, you rejected it.  I'm still willing to make a deal, but it needs to be closer to even for me to accept.",Alice,4,reject
525000.0,475000.0,"Okay, Bob, let's stop wasting time.  I'm willing to go down to a 52.5/47.5 split. Take it or leave it - every round is costing us serious money.",Alice,5,
