I'm starting with a fairly generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept it quickly. Let's see how this goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob is being incredibly greedy! I won't accept such a lopsided offer. Let's see if he's willing to negotiate in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40} 
```

I'm lowering my offer a bit to see if we can reach a compromise. Hopefully, Bob realizes that we both have a chance to lose if we keep going back and forth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob is still pushing his luck!  This is getting ridiculous. I'm not going to settle for such a bad deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50} 
```

I'm going for a 50/50 split. The inflation is starting to hurt, and I think we both need to compromise to avoid getting nothing."
