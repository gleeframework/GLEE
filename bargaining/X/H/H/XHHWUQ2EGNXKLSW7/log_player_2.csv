"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Alice's previous offer was 60% of the total, I'll try to counter with a slightly lower offer. Here's my proposal:

{""bob_gain"": 420000, ""alice_gain"": 580000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation taking effect, my offer from Round 2 is now equivalent to 324,000 (420,000 * 0.77) for me, and Alice's offer is equivalent to 436,800 (560,000 * 0.78) for me. Considering the slight increase in Alice's offer, I'll accept this one.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
