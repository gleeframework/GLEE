Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I propose we start with a 60/40 split in my favor. This seems like a fair starting point considering the inflation rate.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2

{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Alice, your offer was a bit too greedy for me. Let's be more realistic. I propose a 70/30 split in my favor.  The inflation hurts you more, so take this opportunity.""}

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we need to find a compromise. I'm hurting from the inflation, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's do 45/55. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45
