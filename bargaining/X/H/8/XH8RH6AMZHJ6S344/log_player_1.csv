I'm going to start with a proposal that favors me slightly, hoping Bob will see the value in getting something now rather than waiting and risking getting less in the future.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is pretty generous, but I still think I can do better!  I'll reject it and see what kind of counter-offer he makes.  I'm counting on the inflation to be a bigger factor for him than it is for me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

Since Bob was so generous last round, and we're both facing inflation now, I think a 50/50 split is fair. Let's see if he agrees!"
