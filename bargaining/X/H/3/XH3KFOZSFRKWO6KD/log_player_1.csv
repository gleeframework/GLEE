"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but it's still a decent amount. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject the offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair split, considering the starting point 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but the money Bob gains is worth 5% less, I need to consider this when evaluating the offer.

Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can do better than a 60-40 split, especially considering the inflation factor that affects Bob's gain. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""A slight improvement from my previous offer, but I'm still open to negotiations!""
}
```

I've adjusted the split to give Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still holding onto a larger portion of the pie. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A bit more aggressive, but I'm willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation factor, Bob's gain is worth significantly less than it was in the first round. Given the current state of the game, I think this offer is a reasonable compromise.

Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer, as I think the 45-55 split is a fair compromise, especially considering the reduced value of Bob's gain due to inflation."
