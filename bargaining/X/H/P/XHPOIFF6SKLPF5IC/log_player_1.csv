Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. I figure it's a good starting point, and I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round if you reject this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bigger share after you rejected my previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Although this is significantly less than I'd like, accepting is the best option at this point. The inflation is taking a huge chunk out of the money, and I'm not confident I can get a better deal in the next round."
