"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money in a 70:30 ratio. This offers a fair split considering the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60:40 split in my favor. While your initial offer was fair, it's important to recognize the devaluation of money, and this split offers a more balanced outcome for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
