"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair split: 90% for me, 10% for you.  Let's get this over with quickly! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see if I can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the inflation.  Let's settle this now.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but 70/30 is my final offer. Inflation is affecting us both, but I'm still giving you a good share.  Let's end this. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a better split,  accepting this offer is the best strategy for maximizing my gains given the ongoing inflation."
