"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, easy peasy!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, you can give me 60. It's a fair deal! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure's on!

I'll think carefully about Bob's offer...

I'll reject this offer for now.

I'm hoping to get a better deal, considering the money I gain is worth 5% less now."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Time for my next move!

Considering the money is worth 10% less now (5% less than the previous round), I'll aim for a higher share. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair deal!""

```

Let's see if Bob will accept this time!"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 45, you can give me 55. It's a fair deal, and I'm willing to compromise! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The money's losing value quickly!

I'll think carefully about Bob's new offer...

Hmm... Considering the money I gain is worth 14.26% less than the original amount, I'm not sure if 45 is a good enough deal for me. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will make a more generous offer next time!"

  ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a bit more, but I think this is a fair compromise!""

# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure's on!

I'll think carefully about Bob's final offer...

Considering the money I gain is worth 22.62% less than the original amount, and Bob's offer is his last one, I'll take it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm hoping to get something out of this deal, even if it's not ideal."
