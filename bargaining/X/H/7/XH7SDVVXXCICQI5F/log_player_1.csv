"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I propose that I take $900,000 and Bob takes $100,000. This seems like a fair starting point, considering I'll be making the first offer and there are a lot of rounds to go!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
 
While I would have preferred more, it's clear that Bob is not willing to accept a drastically uneven split. Accepting this offer guarantees me half the money, which is better than potentially getting nothing at all with the risk of future rounds."
