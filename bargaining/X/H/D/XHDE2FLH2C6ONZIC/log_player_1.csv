I'm starting with a proposal that's a bit unfair to Bob. I want to see if he'll accept it or if he'll try to negotiate.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
 
I won't accept this offer. He's being just as unfair as I was in the first round. Let's see what happens next."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55} 
```

I'm offering a more balanced split now. I believe this is a fair compromise that could lead to a deal."
