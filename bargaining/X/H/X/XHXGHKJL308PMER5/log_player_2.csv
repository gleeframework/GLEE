"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this split reflects the urgency for me to settle due to the higher inflation rate I face. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I'm Bob, and I want a better deal! The offer is too heavily slanted in Alice's favor, even considering the inflation rates. I'll see if I can get a better deal by proposing myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I believe a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the inflation rates.  Let's get this done quickly, as we both lose money with each passing round.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your offer doesn't reflect the significant difference in our inflation rates. I'm proposing a compromise that still acknowledges your position but secures a more sustainable outcome for me. Time is valuable, but so is a fair resolution. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a 60/40 split, accepting this offer is the most practical choice.  We both lose money with each round, and Alice's offer is fairer than her initial proposal.  It's time to settle and minimize our losses."
