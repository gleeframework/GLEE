Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation working against her. While her offer is better than her Round 1 offer, it's the same as what I offered her in Round 2. She's moving in my direction. I'll hold out for a slightly better deal, knowing the inflation will make her even more eager to settle soon."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Let's stop wasting time, Alice. A 50/50 split is the fairest and quickest way to end this."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a 50/50 split now for a few reasons:

* **Time Pressure:**  We are past the halfway point, and the pressure is mounting on Alice. 
* **Signaling Fairness:** Offering an even split can be persuasive. It shows I'm willing to be reasonable and not exploit the situation fully.
* **Avoiding a Stalemate:** While I'm hoping for more, holding out too long risks Alice becoming desperate enough to gamble on a low offer in the final rounds. 

Let's see if she takes the deal."
