 I'm taking a risk here, Alice! I'm offering Bob a very small amount, hoping he'll be tempted to accept in the early rounds.  I'm hoping inflation will be less of a factor for him, but I'm taking the lead and aiming for the majority share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting this offer. While it's tempting to take a small amount now, the inflation rate means that the value of Bob's offer is dropping rapidly. I want to see if I can secure a better deal in the next round, when I get to propose."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm still aiming for a large share, but I'm increasing Bob's offer to 100,000.  Inflation is a serious factor now, and I need to find a balance between securing a good share for myself and making an offer that's tempting enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. While it's a significant increase from his previous offer, the inflation rate is hitting me hard, and I'm still confident that I can secure a better deal for myself in the next round. I'm aiming for a more equitable split, and I'm willing to wait to see if Bob will budge."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

This is a significant change in strategy. I'm reducing my own share considerably, but I'm trying to make a more appealing offer to Bob. Inflation is heavily impacting me, and I need to reach a compromise quickly. I'm hoping that offering a larger share to Bob will make him more likely to accept, as he's also losing value with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a tricky situation. While Bob's offer is much higher than his previous one, the inflation is hitting me very hard. However, I still believe I can secure a better deal. I'm not convinced Bob is truly aiming for a fair split, and I'm willing to take the risk of waiting for another round and proposing a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

This is a bold move, Alice. I'm proposing an equal split. The inflation is taking its toll, and I'm trying to reach a compromise that benefits both of us. While I'm still hoping for a larger share, I'm willing to compromise to avoid getting nothing in the end."
