I'm proposing to keep $9,000 and give Bob $1,000.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would prefer more, the inflation is hurting me significantly, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all.  Accepting this offer means I still get a sizable amount, even with the reduced value."
