"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 80/20, a fair and reasonable start""}

I'm proposing a 80/20 split, where I get 8,000 and Bob gets 2,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and it gives me a decent chunk of the money to work with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be more equitable. 55/45 split seems fairer to me. I think we can reach an agreement 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 55/45 split, but I think it's a decent compromise. Considering the inflation factor, I'm willing to accept this offer.
