"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly, considering the inflation""}\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split, hoping Bob will accept before the money loses value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your cut diminishes quickly with inflation. This is a generous offer considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI won't accept this offer. Considering the inflation, I think I can get a better deal in the next round. Bob's trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I'm not giving in yet. Bring on the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","### Step 1: Calculate the current value of the money for both Alice and Bob.
For Alice, the money is worth 20% less in each round. Since we are in Round 3, the money is worth 80% * 80% = 64% of its original value for Alice.
For Bob, the money is worth 5% less in each round. Since we are in Round 3, the money is worth 95% * 95% = 90.25% of its original value for Bob.

### Step 2: Determine the offer that Alice should make to Bob.
Given the decreasing value of the money, it's strategic for Alice to try to end the game as quickly as possible to minimize the impact of inflation on her share. However, the offer must be attractive enough for Bob to accept, considering the relatively smaller impact of inflation on his share.

### Step 3: Formulate the offer and message.
Alice should offer a division that reflects the urgency to finalize the deal due to the significant impact of inflation on her potential gain, while also acknowledging Bob's more stable position.

### Step 4: Specify the offer in the required JSON format.
Given the strategic considerations, let's propose a division that slightly adjusts the previous offer to make it more appealing to Bob, while still being mindful of Alice's deteriorating position due to inflation.

The final answer is: {""alice_gain"": 520000, ""bob_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""Considering the rapid inflation on my end, this is a compromise. Let's settle before it devalues further.""}"
