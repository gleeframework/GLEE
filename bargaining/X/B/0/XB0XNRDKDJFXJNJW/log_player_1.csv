I'm going to start with a pretty generous offer to Bob. I want to see if he'll accept a deal where I get the majority, or if he'll try to push for a more equal split.  Let's see how this plays out!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob is being greedy!  I'm not going to accept a deal where I only get 400,000, especially since the money is worth less now due to inflation. I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to try a more balanced offer this time, aiming for a bit more than half the money. I think this is a fair deal, considering the inflation and the fact that I'm willing to give him a significant portion. Let's see if he's more reasonable this time."
