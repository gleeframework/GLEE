"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! I'll take 80, you get 20. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm starting with a relatively generous offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's a fair starting point. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 50 is actually worth 45 (90% of 50).

I'm not sure if this is the best I can get, but I'll accept Bob's offer for now. It's a fair split, and I don't want to risk going to the next round.
