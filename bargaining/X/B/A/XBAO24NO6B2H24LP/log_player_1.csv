"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent chunk, but I'm not going easy on you! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to negotiate a better deal for himself.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than that. I'm not willing to give him a 60-40 split. The game is on!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You got a bit greedy last round, so I'm taking a bit more this time!""
}
```

I'm increasing my share by $50,000 and decreasing Bob's share by the same amount. It's his turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You think you're getting the better deal this time, but I'm not so sure! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to turn the tables on me.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. I think it's a fair deal, and I don't want to risk going to another round. The game is over, and we'll split the $1,000,000 accordingly."
