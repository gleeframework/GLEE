"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor, but I'm willing to compromise and give you a decent share. Now it's your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair, given the potential for inflation. Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing rapidly!

I'm not thrilled about the 40% share, but I'm willing to accept the offer to avoid further negotiations. The value of $400,000 is still better than risking more rounds of inflation.
