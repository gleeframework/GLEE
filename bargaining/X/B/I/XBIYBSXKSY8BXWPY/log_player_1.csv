"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take $6,000 and you can have $4,000. Then we can reassess in the next round.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a relatively fair starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is a fairer starting point. Let's see if we can agree on this before the money loses more value. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain is now worth 20% less, so I'd be getting $4800 in real value, and Bob would be getting $5175.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the 55-45 split, as it's a bit more skewed towards Bob's favor. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal. I'll reject this offer and make a counter-proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with the 55/45 split. I'd like to propose a 50/50 split instead. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can agree on that.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect, my gain is now worth 40% less than in the first round, so I'd be getting $4800 in real value, and Bob's gain would be worth 25% less than in the first round.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and split the remaining money 50/50. It's not ideal, but it's a fair compromise given the inflation.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a more balanced deal, and I hope Bob will accept it."
