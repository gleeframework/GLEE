"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'll start by offering Bob a small share, hoping to secure a quick agreement and avoid the inflation risk.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation is a serious risk. Accepting this offer guarantees me a significant amount, even with the 5% reduction, and avoids further potential loss."
