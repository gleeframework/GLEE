"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

I'll think carefully... With the money being worth 20% less, my share of $500,000 is now equivalent to $400,000 in real value. This is a decent offer, but I'm not sure if I should accept it. I'd rather wait and see if I can get a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer now that Bob has shown his hand.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is the same amount he offered me in Round 2, but I'm taking a slightly larger share for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Let's calculate the real value of the offer... My share of $400,000 is now worth around $206,400 in real value (1,000,000 * 0.8^3 * 0.8 = 0.512, then 400,000 * 0.512 = 204,800, but we are considering the original amount before the last round's inflation, so 400,000).

Bob's share of $600,000 is worth the same as in the first round, $300,000.

Considering the inflation and the decreasing value of my potential earnings, I think I should accept this offer.
