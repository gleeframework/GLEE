"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I take a bit more considering the inflation rate affects me less. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 10% less to me with each passing round, I'd like to try to get a better deal. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think we should divide it more equally, with a slight advantage to me since I'm affected more by inflation.""}\n\n###\n\nLet's see what Alice thinks of this offer!"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The inflation is working against both of us, Bob. I'm willing to meet closer to the middle, but this offer is fairer considering the long game. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm still not satisfied with this offer. Since the money is worth 19% less to me now, I want to try to get a better deal to compensate for the loss in value. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""The inflation is indeed working against both of us, but I'm feeling the pinch more. I think this offer is more balanced considering the current situation.""}\n\n###\n\nLet's see if Alice is willing to accept this offer!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time and the pot is shrinking.  This offer is a slight concession on my part, but it's the best I can do considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlthough the money is worth significantly less now, I still think I can get a better deal. Since we're running out of time, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer in the next round to see if Alice is willing to compromise. Let's proceed!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Time is running out, and the inflation is hitting me hard. I think this offer is a fair reflection of the current situation, considering I've lost over a third of the value already.""}\n\n###\n\nLet's see if Alice is willing to accept this offer!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. This is the last round where an even split benefits us both. Any longer, and the inflation will eat away too much of the pie. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant loss in value due to inflation, an even split at this point seems like the best option. I've lost almost half the value of the money, and it's unlikely I'll get a better offer in the remaining rounds. It's time to cut my losses and accept the offer."
