"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which I think is a fair and straightforward way to divide the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, you can't do better than that! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now. I'm hoping to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 42,
  ""bob_gain"": 58,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give away all the value.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share, but still a significant amount, in the hopes that he'll accept and we can wrap up the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give up too much more! 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value!

Considering the decreasing value of the money, I'm not too thrilled about Bob's offer. I'll reject it and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly! I'll have to be strategic about my next move.

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll make a slightly more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 38,
  ""bob_gain"": 62,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more than that.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping a significant portion for myself. Let's see if he'll accept this offer!"
