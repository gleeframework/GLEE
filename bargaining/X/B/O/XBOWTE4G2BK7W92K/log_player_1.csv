"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
```

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive offer, giving myself the lion's share.  I figure Bob might accept it in the first round, or at least it'll give me a good starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is much more reasonable, but I'm not going to settle for that little. I'll see what he offers next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
```

I'm increasing my offer to 6000, hoping to split the difference with Bob. This offer is more fair and might be more tempting for him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

Bob's offer is pretty good, and even though the inflation is hurting him more than me at this point, I don't want to risk another round and potentially get a worse deal. I'll take the 4000 and call it a day."
