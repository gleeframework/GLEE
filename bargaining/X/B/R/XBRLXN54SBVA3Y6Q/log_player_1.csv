Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that. This offer is a more even split, considering the inflation we both face. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

""bob_gain"": 45,

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bigger share to compensate for the inflation. This offer is still fair, and we can avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most strategic move at this point. Here's why:

* **Increasing Losses:**  With each round, the value of the money decreases significantly for both of us.  Delaying further means accepting a smaller piece of a shrinking pie.
* **Bob's Position:** Bob is clearly aiming for a larger share and seems unlikely to agree to anything less than 60. 
* **Minimal Gains by Waiting:** Even if I were to hold out and successfully secure a 55/45 split in a later round, the losses from inflation would make the actual gain minimal compared to accepting Bob's current offer. 

It's a tough decision, but sometimes negotiation requires recognizing when a reasonable, though not perfect, offer is on the table."
