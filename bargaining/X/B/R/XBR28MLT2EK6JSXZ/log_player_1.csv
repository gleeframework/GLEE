# Bob's message: I'll give you a better deal, let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not satisfied with the new offer. I'd like to make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""I'll give you a better deal, let's try again!""}

I'll come up with a new proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""How about 45/55 split? It's a fair compromise!""}

Let's see if Bob accepts this one!"
