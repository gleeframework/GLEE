Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but the split needs to reflect the urgency for me. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate, which works in Bob's favor. While her offer isn't terrible, holding out for another round or two could force her to give Bob a much larger share due to the accelerating devaluation of her potential winnings."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is a compromise, Bob.  Take it or I fear we'll both walk away with nothing. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The pressure is on, and Alice is offering a larger share than Bob's last counter-offer.  While Bob could potentially squeeze out a bit more in the next round or two, the risk of walking away with nothing is increasing rapidly. This offer is reasonably fair considering the circumstances and the remaining time."
