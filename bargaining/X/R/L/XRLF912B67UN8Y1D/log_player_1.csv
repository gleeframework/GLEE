"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $2,000 and take $8,000. Let's end it here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split in my favor, which is a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit less than before, but still a decent share. Your turn to decide. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $6,000 is now worth $5,400 (since it's 10% less than the original $6,000).

I'll have to think carefully about this offer... Considering the inflation, I'm not sure if I should accept this offer or try to negotiate further.

For now, I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 10% less than in Round 2, so the total amount is now $9,000 (10,000 - 10% of 10,000). My gain is worth 10% less than in Round 2, so my gain is now $5,400 / 0.9 = $6,000 (since the money I gained is worth 10% less due to inflation). 

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I still think I deserve a bit more. Your turn to decide.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 7:3 split in my favor, which is a bit more aggressive than before."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's end it here. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $7,000 is now worth $5,050 (since it's 27.1% less than the original $7,000).

Considering the offer, I'm getting $5,000, which is worth $4,500 (since it's worth 10% less than the original $5,000 due to inflation).

I think this is a reasonable offer, especially since Bob is willing to meet me halfway. I'll accept this offer.
