"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
This offer is incredibly unfair.  While it's tempting to take *something*, it's much better to wait and see if Alice will be more reasonable in the next round.  We still have plenty of time, and the inflation will likely start to have an effect on her offer as well."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}
``` 
Let's start with a fair split.  I believe in a win-win scenario, and this ensures we both get a significant portion of the money before inflation kicks in."
