"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. I think this is a fair split, considering the game is just starting and we both have an equal chance of proposing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that. How about we split it 60/40? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $4,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, so it's now worth $3,600. Bob's gain of $6,000 is now worth 80% of its original value, so it's now worth $4,800.

I'm not too thrilled about Bob's offer, but it's better than my original proposal. I'll accept it for now.
