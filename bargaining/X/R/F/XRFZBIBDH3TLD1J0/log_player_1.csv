"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, which is a generous 30% of the total amount. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, but still leaving some for you 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

I'm not thrilled about the 2:8 split, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to propose a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but still a fair split. Don't wait too long, the money is losing value!""
}
```

I'm trying to negotiate a more balanced split, but I'm also aware that time is running out and the money is losing value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, but you'll still get something 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

I'm not happy about the 1:9 split, but I'm starting to get desperate. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll try to come up with a new proposal that might be more appealing."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is losing value fast! Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""bob_gain"": 600000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bigger share, but I'm not getting much left. Please accept, the money is disappearing!""
}
```

I'm trying to be realistic about the situation and give Bob a larger share, but I'm hoping he'll show some mercy and accept the offer."
