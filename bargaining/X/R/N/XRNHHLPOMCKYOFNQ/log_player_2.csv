{
""bob_gain"": 5500,

""message"": ""My turn. This offer leaves us both better off than waiting."" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Sensitivity:**  Alice's value for the money decreases much faster than Bob's.  It's in Bob's best interest to settle sooner. 
* **Fairness and Incentive:** Offering Alice slightly more than she'd get by waiting another round (where her share would be worth approximately 4800) gives her an incentive to accept.
* **Bob's Advantage:** While the offer is tilted in Bob's favor, it's reasonable enough to potentially avoid a protracted negotiation where the value for both sides diminishes."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Counteroffer, considering inflation 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Shifting Power:** While Alice's offer factors in inflation, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  The longer the game goes on, the more desperate Alice becomes to settle, shifting the power dynamic to Bob.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** Bob can afford to wait another round or two. Even with inflation, he's likely to secure a better deal than 4200 as Alice's position weakens. 
* **Risk Calculation:** While there's a risk Alice might make an even less favorable offer in the next round, the potential reward of a significantly better split in the subsequent rounds outweighs this risk at this stage."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Time is running out. This is my final offer."" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Applying Pressure:**  By stating this is his final offer, Bob introduces a sense of urgency and finality.
* **Exploiting Desperation:** Alice's position is significantly weaker now due to inflation.  She's facing rapidly diminishing returns on her share.
* **Strategic Retreat:**  While 6000 is more than Bob's previous offer, it's still a better deal than he's likely to get if he waits any longer and Alice gets desperate enough to offer a wildly uneven split.  This is about maximizing gain, not aiming for the absolute maximum, which becomes riskier with each passing round."
