Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the inflation concern, but a 5% difference is too large for just one round. Let's try a more balanced approach. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000
