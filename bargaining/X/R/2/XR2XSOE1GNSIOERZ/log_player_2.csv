Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want a fair deal. Let's make it simple: a 50/50 split.  The inflation factor is becoming increasingly significant with each round. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000
