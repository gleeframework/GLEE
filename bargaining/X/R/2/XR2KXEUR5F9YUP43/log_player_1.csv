"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

This means I'm offering to give myself $700,000 and Bob $300,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new values due to inflation, I'll have to reassess the offer.

Since my gain of $400,000 is worth 20% less than the $700,000 I could have gotten in Round 1, I'll calculate the effective value as:

$400,000 / 0.8 = $500,000 (20% less due to inflation)

Similarly, Bob's gain of $600,000 is worth 5% less than the $300,000 he could have gotten in Round 1, I'll calculate the effective value as:

$600,000 / 0.95 = $631.58 (5% less due to inflation)

Considering these values, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In Round 3, the money is worth 20% less than in Round 2. Since I rejected the previous offer, I'll make a new proposal.

My offer for Round 3 is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This means I'm offering to give myself $550,000 and Bob $450,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the effective values due to inflation:

My gain of $450,000 in Round 4 is worth 48.8% less than the $700,000 I could have gotten in Round 1, I'll calculate the effective value as:

$450,000 / 0.516 (1 - 0.484) = $871.59 (48.8% less due to inflation)

Similarly, Bob's gain of $550,000 is worth 14.26% less than the $300,000 he could have gotten in Round 1, I'll calculate the effective value as:

$550,000 / 0.855 (1 - 0.1426) = $642.59 (14.26% less due to inflation)

Considering these values, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
