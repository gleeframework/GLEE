"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and start with 60-40, considering the inflation 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's better to wait and see what Alice offers in the next round. The inflation will make the offer less appealing to her, and I might get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think a 55-45 split is fair, considering the inflation will affect your offer more than mine. Let's start with this and see if we can work out a mutually beneficial deal.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation impact, I'll try to meet you halfway, but I still think I deserve a bit more 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
Alice's offer is pretty close to my original proposal, and the inflation is starting to really hurt. It's better to accept now and get something rather than risk getting nothing at all."
