"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a generous offer, hoping to secure a quick deal. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much worse for me than my initial proposal, and while the money is worth less for both of us, I'm still better off rejecting and making a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly to 70/30, hoping to find a middle ground that Bob will accept.  Since the money is losing value, I'm hoping to close the deal before it's too late."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still worse for me than my own proposal, and the inflation is making it worse with each round. I need to try and get a better deal, so I'm rejecting again."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm willing to compromise a little more, offering 60/40.  The inflation is getting serious, and I don't want to risk losing everything."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is becoming increasingly unfair. The inflation is biting hard, but I'm still better off rejecting and trying to negotiate a better deal.  We're running out of time, but I'm not going to settle for such a bad outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

The inflation is hurting both of us, and it's getting harder to find a deal that benefits both sides.  I'm willing to split the money evenly at this point.  We're both losing a lot of value, so it's time to compromise before it's too late."
