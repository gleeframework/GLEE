"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take 80% and you take 20%""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent share of the money, and I'm leaving room for negotiation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice. 50/50 seems like a good starting point for a long-term partnership. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round. I'll consider Bob's offer, but I'm not sure if I want to give up 50% of the remaining money.

I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more given the risk of inflation. This way, I'll get 60% and you get 40%""
}
```

I'm trying to take advantage of the fact that my gain is worth less due to inflation, and I'm hoping Bob will be willing to accept a slightly lower share for himself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's split the difference.  I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to make sure I get a fair share as well. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on my gains! With the money I gain now worth only 72.9% of what it was in the first round, I'm getting desperate.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not sure if I should accept. On one hand, he's offering a higher share, but on the other hand, I'm still getting a smaller share compared to the initial offer. I'll have to think carefully...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer for now, hoping to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, Bob. I need to make a living, but I'm willing to give you a slightly higher share to avoid going to the last rounds. This way, I'll get 45% and you get 55%""
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive and take a slightly higher share, but I'm also trying to be realistic about the fact that my gains are worth less and less due to inflation."
