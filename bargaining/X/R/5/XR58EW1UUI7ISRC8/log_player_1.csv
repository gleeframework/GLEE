Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start by offering a large portion to myself, but still giving Bob something. I want to see if he's willing to accept a deal that favors me, especially since I don't know how the inflation will affect him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7500 
# Bob gain: 2500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While Bob's offer is a lot closer to a 50/50 split than my first offer, it's still beneficial to me. Inflation has reduced the value of the money I would gain by 20%, meaning I'm actually getting less than $6000 in today's value.  However, I'm not sure if I can do better in the next round.  Since I don't know how the inflation impacts Bob, it's safer to accept this offer and secure at least some money."
