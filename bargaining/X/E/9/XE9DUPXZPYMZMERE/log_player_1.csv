"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This way, I get the majority of the money, but still give Bob a decent share to make the game more interesting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less for Bob, he's trying to compensate by offering me less. I'll accept this offer to move on to the next round.
