"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 70/30, a fair and reasonable proposal.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 30% of the initial $100, which is $30, and keeping 70% for myself, which is $70. This is a fair and reasonable proposal, and I hope Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, let's be equal 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this new offer.

Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, I'll have to adjust my calculation accordingly. My gain of $50 is now worth 90% of its original value, which is $45.

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, since I could potentially get more in future rounds. But on the other hand, meeting in the middle is a reasonable compromise, and I don't want to risk getting nothing if Bob rejects my future offers.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, I'll have to adjust my offer accordingly. I'll offer Bob a smaller share to account for the decreasing value of money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I can live with this, you get a smaller share 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth less and less for me each round!

Since the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, my gain of $40 is now worth 72.9% of its original value, which is approximately $29.16.

Considering the decreasing value of money, I think this offer is reasonable. I'm not getting a great deal, but I don't want to risk getting nothing if Bob rejects my future offers.
