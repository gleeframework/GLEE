Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: While the money is losing value for me, I still believe in a fairer split. Let's go back to the 40/60 split, but this time with me taking the smaller share. It's a win-win for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

""decision"": ""accept"" 
}

This is a good offer for Alice to accept. Here's why:

* **Original Goal Achieved:** Alice's goal from the beginning was likely to secure more than 50% of the money. This offer meets that goal.
* **Inflation Impact:** While Bob is trying to frame this as a concession, the reality is the value of the $40 for him is significantly diminished due to inflation. Waiting any longer will only hurt Bob more, not Alice. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's no guarantee Bob will offer a better deal in subsequent rounds. Accepting now locks in a favorable outcome for Alice."
