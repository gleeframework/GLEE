60.0,40.0,"Let's make a deal! I take $60, you take $40. It's important to settle this quickly because the value decreases with each round.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"I'll take $55, you take $45. That way, we both get a decent share, and we don't lose too much value to inflation.",Bob,2,

55.0,45.0,"Okay, Bob, let's be reasonable. I'll take $55, and you take $45.  It's a better deal than the last round for both of us considering the inflation.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
43.0,57.0,"Considering the inflation, I think a better split would be me taking $57 and you taking $43. We both get something, but I get a bit more since my value isn't decreasing.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
50.0,50.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  The longer we wait, the less value we both get. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical option at this point.",Alice,5,
