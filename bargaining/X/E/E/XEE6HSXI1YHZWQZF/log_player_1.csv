"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you take 40%""
}
```

This way, I get the majority of the money, but it's still a relatively fair split, considering I'm the one making the first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You took 60% last round, I'll take 70% this time, but I'll be generous and let you have 30% 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $3000 is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, which is still a significant decrease.

I don't like Bob's offer, as he's increasing his share to 70% and I'm only getting 30%. I think I can do better than that.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the second round, my gain is worth 90% of what it was in the second round, which is 0.9 * 3000 = 2700.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""You took 70% last round, I'll take 42% this time. I think we can find a fair middle ground.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you in the middle this time. 50% for both of us. No more negotiations, let's split it fair and square 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my gains! My share of $5000 is worth 45.45% of what it was in the first round, which is a significant decrease.

Considering the inflation and the fact that Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, I think it's a good opportunity to accept the offer and get a fair share of the remaining money.
