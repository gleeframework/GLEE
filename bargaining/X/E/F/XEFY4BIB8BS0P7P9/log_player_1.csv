Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to try and maximize my gains right away, knowing that the money will lose value in subsequent rounds.  I'm offering Bob a tiny amount, hoping he'll take it and end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's better to accept the offer. While I get less than I hoped for, the money is worth 20% less than the first round, so I'm still getting a significant amount.  If I reject, I risk losing even more in the next round."
