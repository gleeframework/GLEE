"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $4000 and keep $6000 for myself, which is a relatively fair offer considering the total amount is $10,000. The message ""Let's split fairly"" aims to convey a sense of fairness and encourage Bob to accept the offer, especially since he will lose 10% of the value in the next round if he doesn't accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can find a better split that's fairer for both of us.  Let's compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer because, considering the inflation, his gain of $5500 is actually worth 10% less than in the first round, making it effectively $4950. Meanwhile, my gain of $4500 remains the same value. Given this, I believe I can negotiate for a better split in the next round, as Bob will continue to lose value due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is more than fair""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $4200 and keep $5800 for myself. Given that the money is worth 10% less for Bob in each round, his effective gain is decreasing. In this round, his gain of $4200 is actually worth 20% less than in the first round (10% decrease from round 1 to 2 and another 10% decrease from round 2 to 3), making it effectively $3360. Meanwhile, my gain remains the same value. The message ""Considering inflation, this is more than fair"" aims to highlight this fact and encourage Bob to accept the offer, as further rounds will only decrease his effective gain."
