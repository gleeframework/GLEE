"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, with the message ""Let's be fair"". This is a reasonable starting point, considering the inflation rates. Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Bob in each subsequent round, I'm incentivized to reach an agreement quickly, while Bob may be more willing to hold out for a better offer. However, I'm hoping that the prospect of a quick resolution and a still-substantial gain will be appealing to Bob. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn to propose something more beneficial. Think carefully, the value decreases over time! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer of a 45-55 split in his favor. Considering the inflation rates, I'm still in a relatively strong position, and I don't want to give up too much of the money's value. Since the money is worth 5% less for me in each round, I'd like to try to reach a more favorable agreement before the value decreases further. Additionally, Bob's message suggests that he's trying to create a sense of urgency, but I'm not convinced that his offer is the best I can get. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle""}\n\nI'm offering a 57-43 split in my favor, with the message ""Let's meet in the middle"". Since Bob's previous offer was a 45-55 split in his favor, I'm trying to find a compromise that's closer to the middle ground. Considering the inflation rates, I'm still in a relatively strong position, but I'm willing to make a concession to try to reach an agreement. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a reasonable offer and accept it, rather than risking further decreases in the money's value."
