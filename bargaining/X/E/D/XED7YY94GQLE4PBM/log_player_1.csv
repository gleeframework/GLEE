I propose a 90/10 split, with me getting $90 and Bob getting $10.  This seems like a fair starting point, as it gives Bob something, while still leaving a significant portion for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
``` 

I'm going to offer a more balanced split of 80/20, with me taking 80 and Bob taking 20.  While my offer is still less than in round 1 due to inflation, I believe this offer is fair and will hopefully incentivize Bob to accept."
