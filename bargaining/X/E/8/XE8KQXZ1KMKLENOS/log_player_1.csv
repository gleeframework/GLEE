Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's not a great start. Let's be more realistic.  I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. Think carefully, the clock is ticking and the money is losing value. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000
