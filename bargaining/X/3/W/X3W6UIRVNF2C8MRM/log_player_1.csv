Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going for a big share in the first round, hoping Bob will accept to avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer to keep a larger share, the risk of inflation makes this offer too good to refuse.  It's a fair split and guarantees me a significant gain."
