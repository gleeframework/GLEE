"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. I think this is a good starting point for a mutually beneficial outcome. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. With the 10% inflation, the money is still worth a significant amount, and I believe I can negotiate a better deal. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think a 55/45 split is more reasonable. Let's find a middle ground.""}\n\n###\n\nI've made a counteroffer, taking into account the inflation and trying to find a compromise. Let's see how Alice responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to divide the money now. Let's end this on a positive note, considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the inflation and Alice's willingness to compromise, I believe a 50/50 split is a fair and reasonable outcome. I'll accept this offer to ensure we both get a decent share of the money before it loses more value."
