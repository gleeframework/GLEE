"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, it's a good starting point!""}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, giving me 60 dollars and Bob 40 dollars. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and it's a good compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bigger share this time, but I'm not going to give up too much 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not sure I'm willing to accept this offer just yet.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm looking for a better deal, considering the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 20% less. I think I can do better than a 70/30 split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more""}

I'm proposing a 75/25 split, giving me a slightly larger share than Bob's previous offer. I'm trying to find a balance between being generous and getting a fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting desperate, but I'm still holding out for a better deal 
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on Bob's offer!

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I think I've seen enough offers to know that this is the best I'm going to get. The 80/20 split is still a bit lopsided, but considering the inflation and the fact that I'm getting the same value as in the first round, I think I'll take it."
