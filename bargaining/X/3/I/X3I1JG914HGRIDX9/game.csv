6000.0,4000.0,Let's start fair. I'm offering you 40% and keeping 60% for myself.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I think a 60/40 split in my favor is more reflective of the decreasing value over time.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Let's split it evenly this time. The value is decreasing for both of us, so a 50/50 split makes sense. What do you say?",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4200.0,5800.0,"Alice, time is ticking and the value is decreasing. I'm proposing a 58/42 split. It's a strong offer considering the circumstances.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, we're both losing out on money with each passing round.  Let's meet in the middle again with a 55/45 split.  It's the fairest offer considering the current value of the money.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
3500.0,6500.0,"Alice, this is my final offer. 65/35 split.  Take it or leave it, we're running out of time!",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Bob, we're both losing out significantly now. I'm willing to accept a 40/60 split in your favor to get something at all. This is my last offer. If we don't agree, we get nothing!",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,accept
