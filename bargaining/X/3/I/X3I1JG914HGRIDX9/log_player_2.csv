"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'm offering you 40% and keeping 60% for myself. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Let's see how Alice reacts to a counter-offer. The longer she waits, the less her share is worth."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I think a 60/40 split in my favor is more reflective of the decreasing value over time.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time. The value is decreasing for both of us, so a 50/50 split makes sense. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While the 50/50 split seems fairer now, I can still push for a better deal. Let's see if Alice is willing to concede more as the rounds progress."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Alice, time is ticking and the value is decreasing. I'm proposing a 58/42 split. It's a strong offer considering the circumstances.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're both losing out on money with each passing round.  Let's meet in the middle again with a 55/45 split.  It's the fairest offer considering the current value of the money. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is getting desperate, which means I'm in a good position. Accepting 45% at this stage would be a mistake. I need to hold out for a better deal, even if it means going down to the wire."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6500, ""alice_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer. 65/35 split.  Take it or leave it, we're running out of time!""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're both losing out significantly now. I'm willing to accept a 40/60 split in your favor to get something at all. This is my last offer. If we don't agree, we get nothing! 
# Bob gain: 6000 
# Alice gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a tough one, but it's better to accept a smaller gain than risk getting nothing at all. Alice is clearly drawing a line in the sand, and with the decreasing value, waiting any longer could be disastrous for both of us."
