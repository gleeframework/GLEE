"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take $8000 and you can have $2000. We can negotiate further if you want.""
}
```

This way, I'm taking a significant amount, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair that we split the money more evenly, considering the inflation.  I'll take $6000, leaving $4000 for you.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable agreement. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I'd rather not accept an offer that leaves me with 40% of the original amount, which is now worth 10% less than the original $4000. I'd like to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation is getting worse, I'll aim for a slightly higher share to compensate. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Given the inflation, I'm willing to take a bit more. $5500 for me, $4500 for you. Let's see if we can agree on this.""
}
```"
