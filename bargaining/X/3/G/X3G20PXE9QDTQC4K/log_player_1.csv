I'm going to offer Bob a smaller share initially, hoping he'll accept it quickly. Since we don't know how inflation impacts Bob, I want to secure a large portion of the money before it loses too much value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation! I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000} 
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share than before. My goal is to get a more equitable split while still being aware of the diminishing value of the money. I'll adjust my offer as needed in future rounds, but this seems like a reasonable starting point."
