"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob! You can do better in the next round, I'm sure.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable for the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous last round, let's see if you can do better now! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain is now worth 20% less than the previous round. I need to be more cautious.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal for myself.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a higher share this time. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not afraid to be a little greedy now, Bob. Meet me in the middle?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42-58 split, trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting greedy, but I'm not going to give in yet! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain! I need to be even more strategic now.

However, Bob's offer seems a bit more generous than I expected, considering the inflation. I'll accept this offer to avoid further losses.
