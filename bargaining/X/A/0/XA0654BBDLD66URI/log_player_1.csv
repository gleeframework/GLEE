"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you 10% and take 90% for myself. You can either accept or we can negotiate further.""
}
```

This offer gives Bob a relatively small portion of the money, but it's a fair starting point. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game early!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, Alice. That way we both get a fair share and don't have to risk losing any money to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not sure if splitting it evenly is the best strategy, considering the inflation factor. If I accept this offer, I'll get $500,000, but if I reject it, I might be able to negotiate a better deal in the next round.

I'll reject Bob's offer and see what he proposes next.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes this into account. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to give you a bit more this round. I'll take 70% and leave you with 30%. Will you accept?""
}
```

This offer is a bit more generous than my initial one, but I'm still trying to maximize my gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share this time, but it's still a good deal considering the inflation. Let's agree on this and avoid further risk. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to negotiate a better deal for himself, and I can understand that. However, I'm not convinced that his offer is the best I can get.

I'll reject his offer and try to get a better deal in the next round. The fact that the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round means I have some wiggle room to negotiate.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money Bob gains is worth 37.1% less than in the first round, I'll make a new offer that takes this into account. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation is accelerating, I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share this round. I'll take 55% and leave you with 45%. Will you accept?""
}
```

This offer is a bit more generous than my previous one, but I'm still trying to maximize my gain."
