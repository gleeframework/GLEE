Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to give you a slight advantage this round, but I need a bit more than 40% to make it worthwhile for me. How about 55/45? 
# Bob gain: 45

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're both losing money with each round. I'm offering 60/40, which is a better deal for you than the previous round. Let's end this before the value drops even further! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer seems generous on the surface, it's important to remember the rapid inflation working against me. Accepting 40% now might seem better than my previous 58% offer, but the actual value has significantly decreased.  I need to push for a larger share while it's still worthwhile."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I need a larger share to compensate for the rapid inflation we're both facing. This is my final offer, let's close this out.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Time is running critically short. While 65/35 is a bold ask, it's important to lay down a firm line. The steep inflation means every round significantly diminishes returns. This offer presents a last chance for Alice to secure a reasonable amount before the value plummets further."
