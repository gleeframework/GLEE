"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can seal the deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept it and we can move on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split. Let's end this game and avoid further inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a toll on the money's value.

I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money is worth less with each passing round, I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept this offer just yet. I'd like to propose another round and see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's split it close to equal.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still aiming to get a slightly larger share."
