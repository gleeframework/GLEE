"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! Take the lowball offer and we can end this quickly.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $800,000, and Bob gets the remaining $200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. 50/50 split seems like the most logical way to divide the money. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my $800,000 gain in the previous round is now worth 90% of its original value, which is $720,000. And Bob's $200,000 gain is now worth 95% of its original value, which is $190,000.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll think carefully...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that a 50/50 split is the most logical way to divide the money, especially considering the inflation effect. I'd like to make a counteroffer and try to negotiate a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3

Here's my counteroffer:

  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""You said 50/50 was fair, but I think I'm worth more than you. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the remaining $1,000,000, which is $700,000, and Bob gets the remaining $300,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

I'm still not convinced that a 50/50 split is the most fair option, especially considering the inflation effect. I'd like to make another counteroffer and try to negotiate a better deal for myself."

Here's my next offer:

```

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're both losing money with every round. Let's compromise on a slightly more even split. 520k for me and 480k for you. It's a fair deal, and we can end this before inflation eats away at everything. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my $325,316 gain from the previous round is now worth 32.53% of its original value, which is $104,510. And Bob's $129,531 gain is now worth 81.38% of its original value, which is $105,111.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll think carefully...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think Bob is finally making a reasonable offer. A 52/48 split is closer to what I'm willing to accept, and I'd rather end the game now before inflation continues to erode our gains."
