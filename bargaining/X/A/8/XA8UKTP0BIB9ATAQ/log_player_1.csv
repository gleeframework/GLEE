Although Bob is conceding a little, this deal is still heavily weighted in his favor, especially considering the rapid inflation impacting my share. I need to hold out for a more equitable split."

Bob is using the time pressure to his advantage, but his offer is still not reflective of a fair deal.  I need to hold strong, even though the pressure is mounting."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you were right to call me out on being greedy. Let's end this on a fair note. This offer acknowledges the time pressure and gives us both a good deal. Take it and we can both walk away happy. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is a tough one, but it's time to accept.  

Here's why:

* **Time pressure:** We are running out of rounds, and the value of my share is rapidly decreasing. 
* **Bob's shift:** Bob acknowledged his greed and is offering a significantly better deal than before.  He seems to finally understand the need for a more balanced agreement.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for more is very risky at this point. If we don't reach an agreement, we both get nothing. 

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer guarantees a decent payout considering the circumstances."
