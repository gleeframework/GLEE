"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's start fair. 50/50 seems like a good way to begin.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was fair, but let's be realistic. I'm losing money faster with each round. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""Let's split the difference. I'm willing to give up a bit more, but we need to find a compromise to avoid losing everything.""} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. Take it or leave it, but we're running out of time. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While it's not ideal, accepting Bob's offer is the best course of action. With each round, the money is worth less, and there's a real risk of ending up with nothing.  Taking $35 is better than risking getting nothing."
