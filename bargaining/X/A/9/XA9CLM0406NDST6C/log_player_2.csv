**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to a more reasonable split, time is working against her far more than it is against me.  It's still beneficial for me to hold out for a better offer.  The longer the game goes, the more desperate Alice will become to make a deal, and the more favorable the split will be for me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Okay, let's split this down the middle.  It's a fair deal and avoids us both losing everything to inflation.""}

**Reasoning:**

It's time to move to a more even split. While I still have some leverage, offering 50/50 presents a strong argument for Alice to accept: 

* **Fairness:** It's objectively a fair split.
* **Urgency:** The message emphasizes the increasing risk of inflation for both of us. 

If Alice rejects this, I'll need to seriously consider conceding more in the next round, as the value of the money will continue to plummet for both of us."
