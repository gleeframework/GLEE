It's a good offer, but I'm greedy and want to see if I can get more! Let's see what Alice offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}
``` 
Let's see if Alice takes my counter-offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

I'm willing to accept this offer. While I'd prefer more, the inflation is starting to bite, and I don't want to risk losing everything. A 50/50 split is fair, and it guarantees me a significant amount of money."
