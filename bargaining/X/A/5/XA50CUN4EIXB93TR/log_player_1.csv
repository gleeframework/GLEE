"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 60,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your share loses value faster than mine. Let's be fair. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

""decision"": ""reject""

```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""I understand the situation, but my initial offer was already fair. Let's settle this - I'll take 55 and you take 45.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out, let's split it evenly and call it a deal. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 
 
While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is better than risking getting nothing as the rounds progress and inflation eats away at the potential gains.  Bob is unlikely to offer anything better knowing the pressure is on Alice as her potential gains decrease more rapidly."
