# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fairer.  Let's see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting this offer. Given the inflation rates, I'd rather try to negotiate a better deal in the next round. Let's see what happens next!"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to take 58% and give you 42%.

I'm trying to find a middle ground while taking into account the inflation that's affecting my gains more than Bob's."
