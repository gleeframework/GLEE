"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor. I'm hoping this will be enough to secure a deal quickly, as I'm confident I can do better in future rounds if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation affecting Bob means this offer is likely the best I'll get. Accepting now ensures I receive at least something, and I'm not confident in getting a better deal in the following rounds."
