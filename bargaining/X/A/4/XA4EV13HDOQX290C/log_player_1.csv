"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer, Bob. Take 100k and let's seal the deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small amount, hoping to get a quick agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair to split the money more evenly. 900k for me and 100k for you.  Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

I don't think Bob's offer is very fair, considering the money is worth less now. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer, hoping to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth 40% less now due to inflation!

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think 55% is a fair share for me. Let's make a deal!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to reflect the decreasing value of the money and trying to get a better deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is hitting us both hard. Let's be reasonable and split it 60/40. This way we both get a decent share. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value!

I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I think it's a reasonable offer considering the circumstances. I'll accept Bob's offer to get some cash in my pocket.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

Let's hope Bob keeps his end of the deal!"
