"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose taking 99 dollars for myself, leaving 1 dollar for Bob. This is a classic strategy to start strong and hopefully secure the majority of the money in the first round. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would love to keep the majority of the money, it's clear Bob is not going to be easily swayed. Accepting his offer in this round guarantees me 50 dollars, which is better than risking getting nothing in the following rounds."
