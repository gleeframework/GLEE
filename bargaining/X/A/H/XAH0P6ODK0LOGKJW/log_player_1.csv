Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 51/49 split is more fair. Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nSince I initially proposed a 55/45 split and now Bob is offering a 51/49 split, it seems like we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable division. However, considering the inflation, I believe I can still negotiate for a slightly better deal. So, I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know when it's my turn to make the next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and account for inflation.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I've taken into account the effects of inflation on both our gains and tried to find a middle ground that is slightly more favorable to me than Bob's last offer, but still reasonable for him to consider. I'm hoping this will be acceptable to Bob and we can conclude the game."
