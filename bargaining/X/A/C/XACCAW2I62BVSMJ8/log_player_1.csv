"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share, but I'll get the lion's share this time. You can try to do better next round!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get the entire $100, and Bob gets nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle this time, but I'll try to do better next round! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gain in Round 1 still worth the same, and Bob's offer being 20% less, I'll consider this offer.

I accept Bob's offer for this round:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
