# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'll consider it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob's offer is getting stingy!

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's even more unfair than before. I'm worth 48.8% less than I was initially, and Bob is still getting a huge chunk of the pie. I'll wait for my next chance to make a proposal and try to get a better deal."

I'm proposing a 30-70 split, which is a bit more favorable to Bob, but I'm trying to hold on to as much as I can considering the inflation."
