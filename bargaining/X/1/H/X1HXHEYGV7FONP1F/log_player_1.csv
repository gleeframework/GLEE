Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was a bit too lopsided. Let's be more realistic.  I'll take 4500$, leaving you with 5500$.  This accounts for the time pressure, but still lets us both walk away happy. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500
