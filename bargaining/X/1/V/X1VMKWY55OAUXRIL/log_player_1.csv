"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, I'll take the smaller share for now""
}
```

This way, I'm taking the smaller share for now, but I'm leaving room for negotiation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split the money evenly, 5000 for each of us. It's fair and ensures both parties receive an equal share. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less now, my gain of $5000 is equivalent to $4000 in the first round. I'm not sure if I want to settle for this, especially since I could potentially get more in future rounds. I'll reject Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 40% less now (20% less than the previous round), my gain of $5000 is equivalent to $4000 in the first round, but now it's worth 40% less, so it's equivalent to $4000 * 0.6 = $2400. I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, I'll take a bit more this time""
}
```"
