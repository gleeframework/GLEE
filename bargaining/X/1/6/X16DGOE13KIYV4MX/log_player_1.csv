"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a good starting point, Alice. However, I think a 55/45 split is more in line with the fact that the money loses value for both of us as time passes.  I am open to further negotiation, but let's not let this drag on too long. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle.  I think a 50/50 split is fair, given the time pressure and how the value of the money is decreasing.  This way, we both get something substantial, and we avoid the risk of getting nothing.""}
