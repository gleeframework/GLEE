"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, and we can negotiate from here""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer to start the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, let's see if you'll take it 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 10% inflation, my gain of 4000 is now worth 80% of the original 5000, which is 4000. The offer is still a bit skewed towards Bob, but it's a slightly better offer than my initial proposal.

I'll decide to reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer that's a bit more favorable to me, considering the inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you in the middle, but I'm still hoping for a better deal""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45/55 split, which is a bit more generous than my initial offer, but I'm still trying to get a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give away too much 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 27.1% inflation, my gain of 3500 is now worth 72.9% of the original 5000, which is approximately 3645. Since I'm not getting the exact amount I proposed in round 3, I'll decide to reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer that takes into account the increasing inflation and tries to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42/58 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than Bob's previous offer, but still leaves room for negotiation."
