"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $20, which is a relatively small amount, hoping that he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going all the way to 50/50 just yet! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the $70 I would gain in this round is actually worth 80% of the original $80 I would have gotten in the first round, which is $64.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, but I'll think about it for a moment...

I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Meet me halfway, Bob! Let's split it 50/50 and end this!""
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive this round, aiming for a 50/50 split. Will Bob accept?"
