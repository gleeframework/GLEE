"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more since you're the one losing value over time 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5800,
""bob_gain"": 4200,
""message"": ""The clock is ticking, Bob. This is a good deal for both of us.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're running out of time, and the money is losing value for you. I'm being generous here. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is taking advantage of the situation and steadily decreasing his offer. I need to hold out for a better deal, even if it means accepting a slightly smaller amount in a later round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""This is my final offer, Bob. It's a fair deal considering the time pressure.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm not buying it. The money's value is plummeting for you. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While not ideal, accepting this offer is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** With only 6 rounds left, the time pressure is immense. My potential gains are rapidly decreasing with each passing round.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Waiting any longer will likely result in Bob offering even less, as he knows the value is constantly shrinking for me.
* **Guaranteed Gain:** Accepting this offer guarantees a return, even if it's less than initially hoped. Rejecting it carries the significant risk of walking away with nothing. 

It's a tough pill to swallow, but in this scenario, cutting my losses and securing a portion of the money is the most rational choice."
