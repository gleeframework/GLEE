"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. What do you think, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll try to do better than Bob's offer. Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}

I'm offering a slightly larger share to myself, but still a reasonable compromise. What do you think, Bob?"
