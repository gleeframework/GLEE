"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60-40""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 40%. This seems like a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split in my favor is fair, considering the inflation we'll both face in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see that Bob wants to flip the script and take 60% of the remaining money, leaving me with 40%. Considering the inflation effect, the actual amounts are:

My gain: $400,000 (worth 95% of $420,000)
Bob's gain: $600,000 (worth 80% of $750,000)

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer. I think I can do better than that. I'll reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer. Considering the inflation effect, I'll aim to get a larger share of the remaining money. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a bigger share to compensate for the inflation, but I'm still willing to be generous""
}
```

This time, I'm offering to take 70% of the remaining $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 30%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if he rejects it."
