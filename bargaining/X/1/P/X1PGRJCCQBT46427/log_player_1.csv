"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80/20, I'll take the lead!""
}
```

This offer gives me $8,000 and Bob $2,000, which is a 80/20 split. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finish the game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, a fair deal! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $5,000 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, so it's actually $4,000 in ""real"" value.

Considering the offer, I'll decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not interested in a 50/50 split, I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 80% of its original value after the first round and 64% after the second round, my offer for Round 3 will be:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6400,
  ""bob_gain"": 3600,
  ""message"": ""You're getting greedy, let's meet in the middle!""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly more favorable split, but still trying to get a better deal for myself."

# Bob gain: 4000
