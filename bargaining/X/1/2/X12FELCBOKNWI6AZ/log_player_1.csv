"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. We can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a relatively fair starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better offer, but I think I deserve more since I'm the one making the proposal this round. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the value of the money has decreased. I'll have to be more cautious with my decision.

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 75-25 split, especially since I'm not sure how much the inflation affects Bob's perception of the value of the money. I'll wait for a better offer."

  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm still looking for a fair split.""

# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking its toll! The money is worth less and less with each passing round.

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 4:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 35-65 split, especially since I think I'm already giving Bob a relatively generous offer considering the inflation. I'll wait for a better offer."

Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll on the money's value!

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 6:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 40-60 split, especially since the money is worth significantly less than it was at the start. I think I can do better than this."
