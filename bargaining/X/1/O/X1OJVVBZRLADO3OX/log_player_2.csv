Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 60

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's find a compromise. I'm willing to come down slightly to 58/42. This reflects the increasing pressure of inflation on both of us. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing a tough game, but she's finally acknowledging the inflation pressure.  While 58/42 is slightly better, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  I need to show her I'm serious about getting a more equitable deal.  The increasing inflation rate means each round is getting more costly for me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking.  I appreciate the movement in your last offer, but it wasn't enough.  I'm proposing 52/48. This accounts for the inflation impact while acknowledging your initial advantage. Let's close this out.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** We're past the halfway point, and the increasing inflation rate makes each round riskier for me.  A sense of urgency needs to be injected.
* **Conciliatory but Firm:**  Acknowledging Alice's slight concession (58/42) shows I'm willing to negotiate, but my counter-offer (52/48) firmly pushes for a more balanced split.
* **Justification:**  The message reinforces that my proposal aims for fairness given the inflation dynamic.

Alice is likely to recognize that I'm not backing down. This offer might be the tipping point for her to accept a deal before the potential gains erode further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a critical juncture.  I'm proposing 55/45. This offer balances the need for a fair resolution with the ever-increasing impact of inflation.  Let's end this now and both walk away with something. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Concession:** Alice has moved from 58/42 to 55/45, a notable shift that demonstrates a willingness to reach a deal.
* **Inflation Impact:**  The compounding effect of the 5% inflation is becoming increasingly detrimental. While not ideal, accepting 45 now is better than risking even less in subsequent rounds.
* **Time Pressure:**  With only 5 rounds remaining, the risk of walking away with nothing significantly increases if I continue to reject her offers.

While I believe I could potentially secure a slightly better split in a perfect scenario, the current offer in the context of the shrinking pot and limited time makes it the most rational choice."
