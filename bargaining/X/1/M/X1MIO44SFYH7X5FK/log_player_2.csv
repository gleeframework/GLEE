Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, let's meet in the middle 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 52,
""alice_gain"": 48,
""message"": ""Time is running out, let's be reasonable. This offer is still good for both of us.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is taking advantage of the situation.  Even though her offer is creeping up, it's still heavily skewed in her favor thanks to inflation working against me.  I need to hold out for a better deal, but time is running out."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""This is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the fairest option. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is eating into my potential gains significantly. It's time to draw a hard line. Offering a 50/50 split is fair and gives Alice a strong incentive to accept. If she rejects this, the remaining rounds will likely result in even worse offers due to the accelerating inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your 'final offer' wasn't final, was it? 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision, but with the inflation rapidly eroding my potential gains, I need to cut my losses.  Alice is clearly willing to play hardball, and waiting longer is likely to result in even worse offers from her. Accepting 44 is much better than getting nothing at all if we run out of rounds."
