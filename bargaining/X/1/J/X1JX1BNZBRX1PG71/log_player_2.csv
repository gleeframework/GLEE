"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Take it or leave it, Bob. This is the best deal you'll ever get! 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm not going to accept a deal where I only get $1. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000, ""message"": ""I think we can find a more equitable split. I propose we divide the money 90/10, with me getting 90% and you getting 10%. Let's be fair.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer, Bob.  The next round is going to be even worse for you.  Think about it. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a better deal, the inflation is making each round worse for me. Accepting this offer guarantees me $100,000, which is better than risking getting nothing in the next round."
