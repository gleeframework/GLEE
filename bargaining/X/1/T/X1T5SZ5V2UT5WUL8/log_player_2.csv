Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, this is a generous offer. Think carefully before rejecting! 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in round 3 is the most logical choice for Bob at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The longer the game continues, the less the money is worth. Accepting a less-than-ideal offer now is better than risking an even worse offer later.
* **Alice's Declining Gains:**  Alice's potential gains are decreasing at a faster rate than Bob's. Her willingness to offer 58% (albeit a 58% with a lower value) suggests she understands the impact of inflation and wants to settle.
* **Future Uncertainty:** There's no guarantee that Alice will offer a better deal in subsequent rounds. She might become more determined to secure a larger portion, even if it means a smaller overall pie.

By accepting now, Bob secures a reasonable sum, even after inflation. Rejecting risks a worse outcome with each passing round."
