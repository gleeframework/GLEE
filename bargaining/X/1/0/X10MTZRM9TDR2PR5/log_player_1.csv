I'm proposing to keep the majority of the money, as I'm the first to make a proposal.  I'm offering Bob a small amount, hoping he might accept to avoid risking getting nothing in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm again trying to keep the majority, but I'm increasing Bob's share slightly.  I'm hoping he'll accept, as the inflation is starting to take effect and we are running out of time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I am going to reject this offer.  While it's tempting to take something rather than risk getting nothing, the inflation is starting to really affect the potential outcome.  I want to try to get a larger share, and I think there's still time to do so."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm increasing Bob's share again, hoping he will accept this offer.  The inflation is starting to seriously reduce the value of the money, and I want to avoid ending up with nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still going to reject this offer. Even though the inflation is really starting to bite, I'm hoping that Bob will eventually offer me a larger share. We're approaching the halfway point, and the stakes are getting higher with each round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

The inflation is becoming a serious factor, but I still believe I can negotiate a better deal for myself.  I'm again increasing Bob's share, but I am aiming for a larger portion.  I hope he will accept this offer, as we are getting closer to the end of the game."
