Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was tempting, but let's be practical.  How about a 55/45 split in your favor? It considers the time-value of the money, giving you a slight edge while still being a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
