"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI hope Bob will accept this offer. It's a generous one, considering the inflation that affects us both."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable. This is a good deal for both of us given the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI won't accept this offer. The inflation affects Bob's gain more than mine, so I'll try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I think this is fair""}\n\n###\n\nGiven that the money is worth less with each passing round, especially for Bob, I've adjusted my offer to reflect this. It's still a bit in my favor, but it's a compromise considering the circumstances. Hopefully, Bob will see it as a reasonable proposal and accept it."
