"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

This gives me a decent chunk of the money, but still leaves Bob with a reasonable amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. Since the money is worth 5% less now, Bob's offer is actually equivalent to 4750 in the first round. That's a pretty even split, but I'm not sure if I want to give up my advantage. I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less now (5% less than the previous round), I'll make a new offer that takes this into account. Here it is:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

This offer gives me a slightly larger share, but still leaves Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is really losing value quickly! In the first round, my offer was worth 6000, but now it's worth 5200, so Bob's offer is actually a slightly better deal than my original offer. I'll accept this one.
