"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept and we can end the game early, or I'll make a counteroffer in the next round!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is a relatively small share, but it's a fair starting point. The message is a gentle nudge to encourage him to accept the offer and end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's fair, and we can both walk away with a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering Bob's proposal, I'll have to think carefully. If I accept this offer, I'll get $5,000, which is worth 5% less than the $8,000 I proposed in the first round. However, it's still a decent amount, and splitting it evenly might be a good strategy to avoid further negotiation.

I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```"
