"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to be greedy in the first round and see if Bob is willing to take a very small share.  Let's see what he decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. Bob's being just as greedy as I was in the first round. I think I can get a better deal than $1."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm going to propose an even split.  It's the fairest offer, and since we only have 12 rounds, I think it's in both our best interests to come to an agreement quickly."
