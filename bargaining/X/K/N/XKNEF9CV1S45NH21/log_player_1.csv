"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}

This way, I get the majority of the money, but still leave Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my share is worth even less. I'll have to think carefully...

I accept the offer.
