# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my decision.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than a 45% share. I'll wait for a new proposal from Bob."

```"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle. I'm proposing a 40/60 split. It's more fair than our previous offers, and I think it's a good starting point for further discussion. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my decision.

I'm accepting Bob's offer. A 60/40 split seems reasonable, and I think it's a good compromise. Let's finalize the deal!"
