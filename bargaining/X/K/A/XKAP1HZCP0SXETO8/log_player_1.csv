"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000, leaving Bob with $2,000. My message is a friendly and fair opening offer, inviting Bob to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I think I deserve more since I'm the one making the proposal 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less in Round 2, I'll have to adjust my thinking.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll respond:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I think you're getting a bit too generous, Bob. I'll wait for a better deal.""
}
```

I'm rejecting the offer because I think I can do better than 40% of the remaining $8,000 ($3,200). I'm hoping Bob will come back with an even better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 40% of its original value in Round 3, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you in the middle, but I think I deserve a bit more for taking the risk of rejecting your previous offer.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the remaining $6,400 ($3,840), leaving Bob with $1,600. My message is a bit more assertive, acknowledging that I'm taking a risk by rejecting his previous offer, but still open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise and meet you in the middle, but I think this is a fair split considering the decreased value of the money 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my thinking again.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll respond:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""I think we've finally found a fair split, Bob. Let's call it a day!""
}
```

I'm accepting the offer because meeting in the middle at this point seems like a reasonable compromise, considering the decreased value of the money. I'm willing to settle for 50% of the remaining $5,120 ($2,560)."
