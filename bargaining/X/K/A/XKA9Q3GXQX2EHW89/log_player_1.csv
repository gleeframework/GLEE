"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10} 
```

I'm starting with a pretty uneven split. I want to see if Bob is willing to accept a small portion, knowing that if he rejects, he'll be making the next proposal. This way, I can gauge his risk tolerance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I would prefer a larger share, I'm accepting Bob's offer.  The money is shrinking rapidly due to inflation, and I don't want to risk getting an even worse deal in the next round."
