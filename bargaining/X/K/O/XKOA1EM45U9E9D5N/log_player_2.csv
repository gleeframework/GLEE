# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation working against me.  While this offer is tempting as time runs out, I believe I can still get a better deal in the next round or two before the value drops too drastically."

# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**  The inflation is killing me! While this is not a good offer, it's the best I'm likely to get at this point. If I reject this, I risk getting even less in subsequent rounds, potentially walking away with nothing."
