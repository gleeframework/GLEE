"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 60/40 split.  It's a fair starting point, but I'm open to negotiation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nSince the money doesn't lose value for me, I have no incentive to accept an offer that isn't at least 50/50. I can keep rejecting until Alice agrees to a better split.\n\n###\n\nLet's see what happens next!"

Round 2

This way, we can both walk away with a decent amount.""}\n\n###\n\nLet's see what Alice thinks!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to split the money evenly this time. It's clear we both want to reach an agreement, and this is the most fair way to do so. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nSince the money doesn't lose value for me, I can keep pushing for a better deal. Alice is getting desperate because the money is losing value for her, so I think I can get an even better offer in the next round.\n\n###\n\nLet's see what happens next!"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I know the money is losing value for you, so I'm willing to take a bit more.
