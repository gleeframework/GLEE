"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, hoping to set a fair tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll try to negotiate from here! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is trying to negotiate from a stronger position.

I'll consider his offer, but I'd like to make a counteroffer to try to get a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'd like 45 for myself.""
}
```

I'm increasing my gain from 40 to 45, hoping to meet Bob halfway."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With inflation taking its toll, the money is worth less, and I need to adjust my proposal accordingly. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm still willing to give you a majority of the money, Bob, but I'd like to keep a bit more for myself this time.""
}
```

I'm keeping my gain at 45, but offering Bob a slightly larger share to try to reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting greedy, Alice! I'll try to take a bigger share now! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is trying to take advantage of my perceived greed!

I need to reevaluate my strategy and consider the decreasing value of the money. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not giving up that much, Bob. I'll counter with 37 for myself.""
}
```

I'm increasing my gain from 30 to 37, trying to find a balance between getting a fair share and not giving up too much."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 37,
  ""bob_gain"": 63,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a larger share, Bob, but I need to keep a bit more for myself to account for the inflation.""
}
```

I'm keeping my gain at 37, but offering Bob a slightly larger share to try to reach a deal, while also acknowledging the decreasing value of the money."
