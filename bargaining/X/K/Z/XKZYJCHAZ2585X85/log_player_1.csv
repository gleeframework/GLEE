Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than a 50/50 split.  I'm willing to offer you 40% since I know your money will be worth less in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60
