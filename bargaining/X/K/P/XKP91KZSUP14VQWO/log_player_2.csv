"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a fair starting point, and it gives us both a good share of the money. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's a decent starting point, I want to see if I can get a better deal.  The inflation rate means that waiting a round might be worth it for me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. It's a fair deal considering the inflation rate - you'll get 40% of the value, while I get 60%.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time. We both have to account for inflation, and a 50/50 split feels fairer given the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a bigger share, the inflation rate is hitting hard. It's not worth risking another round and getting even less. Accepting a 50/50 split is the best option at this point."
