I'm proposing to take $9,000 and leave $1,000 for Bob. This is a fair starting point, considering the potential for inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
``` 

I propose we split the money more evenly this time, with me taking $5,500 and Bob getting $4,500. This is a fair compromise given the previous round's rejection and the looming threat of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000

Round 5

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
``` 

I'm proposing a more even split again. I'll take $6,000 and Bob will get $4,000. This is a fair offer considering the ongoing inflation and our previous failed negotiations.  We need to reach an agreement soon to avoid losing more money!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This offer is too low.  The inflation is hitting hard, but I'm not giving up so much.  We need to negotiate a more fair deal.  I'm confident we can find a way to split the remaining value in a way that is better for both of us."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000} 
``` 

I propose we split the money evenly at $5,000 each.  The inflation is getting serious now, and this is the fairest way to divide the remaining value.  It's time to be reasonable and reach a compromise."
