Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'd like to propose a more even split. This way, we both get a decent share of the money, and we don't need to keep playing this game. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit further, but we need to reach an agreement soon.  Let's split the difference and both come away with something substantial. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is getting increasingly desperate as the value of his potential winnings plummets.  While his offer is closer to a 50/50 split, it's still heavily in his favor considering the rapid depreciation of his share. I'm betting he'll be forced to be far more generous soon."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're both losing money with every round. Let's be reasonable and split the money evenly.  This way, at least we'll both get something out of this. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is the safest option. Bob's share has depreciated significantly, making the deal more appealing.  Continuing to gamble could result in an even worse outcome as we approach the final rounds."
