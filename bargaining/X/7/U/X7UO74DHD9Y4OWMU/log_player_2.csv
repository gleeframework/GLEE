{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Your offer was a good starting point, Alice. However, I think a 55/45 split is more reflective of the fact that the value of the money decreases for both of us over time.""}

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable. I think a 50/50 split is the fairest solution now that inflation has impacted both of us.  It's a clean break and avoids further complications. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
