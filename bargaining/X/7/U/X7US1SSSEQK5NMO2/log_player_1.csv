"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a fair compromise, given the devaluation of the money with each round. Let's end this game and avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
