I'm going for a greedy approach!  I'll take almost everything, leaving Bob just $1. It's a long shot, but it's the best chance I have to maximize my potential gain in the early rounds.  Let's see if he bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll accept this offer. While I'm getting a much smaller share than I wanted, it's still a decent amount of money, and I'm not confident I could do better in the following rounds with the inflation factor.  It's better to take what I can get now than risk getting nothing."
