"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. This is a fair starting point, and I hope Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the values are:

My gain: 4800 (60% of 8000, since 6000 is 75% of 8000, and 75% of 75% is 56.25%, which is 56.25% of 8000)
Bob's gain: 4500 (40% of 8000)

Bob's proposal is to split it 50-50, which is a reasonable offer. I accept!
