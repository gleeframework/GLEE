"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice. I'll take 950000, leaving you with 50000.  It's a much fairer split than your last offer.  Take it or we can go another round, but remember, the money loses value with each round. 
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
