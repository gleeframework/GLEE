"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This offer takes into account the decreasing value of money over rounds. I propose we split the initial $100 with a ratio of 3:1 in favor of you, Bob. This ensures you receive a larger share earlier in the game. 
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
