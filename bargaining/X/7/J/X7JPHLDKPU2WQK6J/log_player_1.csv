"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, the money I gain in this round is worth 20% less than in the first round, so I'll get 60% of 80% of the initial $1,000,000, which is 480,000.

Bob's offer is 550,000, which is more than the 480,000 I would get in this round, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can do. I'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In this round, the money is worth 40% of its initial value (80% of 80% of the initial value). I'll aim to get a higher share to compensate for the inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the effective value of the money in this round. The money is worth 40% of its initial value (80% of 80% of 80% of the initial value). 

In this round, I would get 60% of 40% of the initial $1,000,000, which is 240,000.

Bob's offer is 475,000, which is more than the 240,000 I would get in this round, but it's still a relatively small share. Considering the inflation, I'll accept this offer.
