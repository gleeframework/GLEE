"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share to ensure we both get a decent amount. Since inflation impacts your share more, I'm offering this split to make it fairer for you. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
