Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 550000,

}
```

I'm offering you 450,000$ and keeping 550,000$ for myself. Will you accept or reject?"

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll aim to maximize my gain. I'll reject this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

  ""bob_gain"": 580000
