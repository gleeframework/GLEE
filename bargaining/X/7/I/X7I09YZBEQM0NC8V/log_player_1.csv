Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: It's only fair that I get slightly more since I'm making the offer now.  Let's split the money almost evenly, but with a slight edge to the proposer to account for the risk of rejection.  
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
