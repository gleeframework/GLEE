Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a proposal that gives me the majority of the money.  I'm hoping Bob will accept this in the first round, but I'm prepared to negotiate if he doesn't!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though my share is lower, it's still a good deal considering the inflation and the fact that I have to wait another round to make an offer."
