 I'm going to offer Bob a measly $1. Since I'm being stingy, I figure he'll reject the offer and give me a chance to make a more reasonable proposal next round.  Let's see if he bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

This offer is absolutely ridiculous! I'm not accepting a single dollar while Bob gets to keep almost everything.  I'm hoping he'll be a little more reasonable next time."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

Let's try a more balanced approach this time.  I'm offering Bob half the money. It seems like a fair deal, and hopefully, it will convince him to accept before we both lose out!"
