"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, it's a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, hoping to set a good tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making a decision.

Since Bob's offer is worth 5% less than the initial amount, I'll calculate the actual amount I'd gain in the next round, taking inflation into account.

If I accept this offer, I'll get $4000 now, and in the next round, the money will be worth 0.95% of its current value (due to 5% inflation), so I'll effectively gain $3800.

However, if I reject this offer and make a new proposal, I might be able to negotiate a better deal. I'll try to make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, trying to take into account the fact that Bob was willing to give me $4000 in the previous round.

Since the money is worth 0.95% of its original value, I'll aim to get a higher percentage of the remaining amount. I'll propose a slightly higher share for myself.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a slightly larger share this time, but still a fair deal!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not giving up yet! 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to get closer to his desired share. I'll calculate the actual amount I'd gain in the next round, taking inflation into account.

If I accept this offer, I'll get $5200 now, and in the next round, the money will be worth 0.85% of its original value (due to 14.26% inflation), so I'll effectively gain $4280.

However, if I reject this offer and make a new proposal, I might be able to get an even better deal. I'll try to make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the fact that Bob was willing to give me $5200 in the previous round.

Since the money is worth 0.85% of its original value, I'll aim to get an even higher percentage of the remaining amount. I'll propose an even larger share for myself.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting closer to my target, but I'm still willing to compromise!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, I'm willing to compromise! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to get back to the original 50/50 split. I'll calculate the actual amount I'd gain in the next round, taking inflation into account.

If I accept this offer, I'll get $5000 now, and in the next round, the money will be worth 0.77% of its original value (due to 22.62% inflation), so I'll effectively gain $3850.

Considering the current inflation rate, I think this offer is a reasonable compromise. I'll accept this offer to avoid further negotiations.
