"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair share, let's start with a clean slate!""}

I'm proposing that I receive 60% of the initial $100 and Bob receives 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a slightly more even split. I think this is fair, considering the inflation we need to account for. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not convinced by Bob's offer. I think I can do better.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and split it evenly, considering the inflation!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which I think is a fair compromise given the reduced value of the money due to inflation."
