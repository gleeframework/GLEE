"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split in my favor, which means I'll get $8,000 and Bob will get $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, let's try to find a middle ground! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I was expecting a rejection, but now it's my turn to make a decision.

Considering the new offer, I think I can do better than a 2:3 split. I'll reject this offer and propose a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Too generous, I'll make a better offer""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, the total amount is now $9,000 (10,000 x 0.9).

I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""A more balanced split, let's compromise!""
}
```"
