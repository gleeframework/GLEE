I propose a fair (in my opinion) division where I get $90, and Bob gets $10. This way, I have a good starting point, and Bob will have a chance to improve his share in the following rounds."

I'm still aiming for a good share, but I'm willing to compromise a bit more.  I'm offering $85 for myself and $15 for Bob.  This reflects the inflation, and I'm hoping this offer will be more agreeable."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

We are nearing the end of the game and the inflation is very high now.  This is my final attempt to reach an agreement. I'm offering Bob a larger share, but I need to secure at least 65 dollars to make it worthwhile."
