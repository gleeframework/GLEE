"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. This is a fair starting point, as it demonstrates my willingness to share, while also ensuring a significant portion of the money goes to me.  Let's see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred a larger share, a 50/50 split is fair given the inflation factor and the risk of getting nothing at all if we keep rejecting offers."
