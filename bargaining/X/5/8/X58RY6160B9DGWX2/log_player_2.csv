Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting desperate, I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a tough one, but I have to cut my losses.  The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me and Alice is showing no signs of being reasonable. Accepting a 42/58 split is far from ideal, but it's better than risking another round and getting even less."
