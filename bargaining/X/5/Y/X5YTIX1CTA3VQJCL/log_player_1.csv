"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This is a simple, fair offer, as Bob would get 10% of the money, and Alice would get 90%.  I'm hoping Bob will accept in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I will reject this offer. While it's better for me in the short term, I know I can do better if I play strategically. Bob is being greedy and I can still potentially get a larger share with a bit of negotiation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the money. This is a fair offer, as I'm still receiving the majority of the money. With each round, Bob's offer will be worth less and less, and I'm confident I can get a better deal than his last offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I will reject this offer again. It's clear that Bob is trying to pressure me with the inflation, but I won't be rushed. I'm confident I can still get a more favorable deal in the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm dropping my offer by another 100,000, but I'm still offering a majority of the money to Bob. With each round, the value of the money decreases for both of us, so it's in his best interest to accept this offer. I'm hoping that he realizes this and is willing to negotiate a fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. While the inflation is starting to hurt, I'm still confident that I can get a better deal. Bob is still offering a significantly higher share to himself, and I'm not willing to settle for that. I believe I can still negotiate a more balanced split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still offering Bob a significant share. The inflation is increasing, and we are getting closer to the end of the game. I believe this offer is fair and gives Bob a good return on his investment."
