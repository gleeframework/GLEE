"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I take a bit more considering the inflation rate. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Your turn, Alice. I'm feeling generous, but let's not drag this out."" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Exploiting Inflation:** Alice's offer heavily favored her, banking on Bob's money losing value quickly. By rejecting, Bob signals he understands the inflation mechanic and won't be easily swayed.
* **Strong Counter-Offer:**  5500/4500 is a significant shift in Bob's favor. This puts pressure on Alice as her share will decrease more rapidly than Bob's in subsequent rounds.
* **Time Pressure:** The message aims to make Alice consider the declining value of the money. A quick agreement benefits Bob more than a protracted negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate the generosity, Bob, but let's be fair. Time is money, and it's losing value fast. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Calling Alice's Bluff:**  Alice is trying to use the time pressure tactic, but her offer is less generous than Bob's previous one. This suggests she might be bluffing about her willingness to let the money depreciate.
* **Shifting Power Dynamic:** By rejecting a less favorable offer, Bob reasserts control over the negotiation. Alice is now in a weaker position knowing Bob is willing to play the long game.
* **Anticipating a Better Deal:** Alice's desperation will likely increase in the next round, giving Bob a good chance to secure a more advantageous split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""This is getting us nowhere, Alice. My final offer: take it or leave it."" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** Bob lowers his demand slightly, showing a willingness to compromise but still maintaining an advantageous position.
* **Finality:** By stating this is his ""final offer"", Bob creates a sense of urgency and signals he's unwilling to negotiate further.
* **Exploiting Alice's Position:**  Alice's potential gains are diminishing faster than Bob's.  She's incentivized to take a decent deal now rather than risk getting a much worse one in later rounds.
* **Psychology:**  The ""take it or leave it"" approach can sometimes push the other party towards accepting, especially if they perceive the offer as their last chance for a reasonable outcome."
