Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that.  Let's split it 60/40 in my favor, since I have to wait a whole round to make a counter-offer. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but let's be realistic. 55/45 is a good middle ground for us.  I'm not going to go lower than that. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to take advantage of the situation. He knows the value of the money is decreasing for me, so he's trying to push for a slightly better deal each round. It's important to show him I won't be pressured into accepting an unfair offer. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to protect my own interests."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 52,
""bob_gain"": 48,
""message"": ""Bob, we're running out of time, and the deal is getting worse for both of us every round. This is my final offer, let's be reasonable and close this out.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  We are now past the halfway point, and the inflation is really starting to hurt. Bob needs to understand that dragging this out hurts him too.
* **Show of Compromise (Slight):** By slightly decreasing my demand, I am signaling a willingness to negotiate, but I'm also standing firm that I deserve a larger share due to the time disadvantage. 
* **Finality:**  By stating ""final offer,"" I'm hoping to convey the seriousness of the situation and encourage Bob to accept before the potential winnings shrink even further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer to a deal. I'll go down to 52/48, but this is it for me. Let's not let our stubbornness get in the way of a good outcome. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer at this point is the most logical choice. 

* **Diminishing Returns:** The inflation is heavily impacting the value of the deal for me. Waiting longer means significantly less money, even if I manage to get a slightly better split. 
* **Bob's Stance:**  Bob seems firm on his offer, and there's a risk he won't budge further, leading to us both getting nothing in the end. 
* **""Something is better than nothing"":** Accepting 48% of something is much better than ending up with 0% due to stubbornness.  

It's a tough decision, but strategically, it makes the most sense to cut my losses and secure what I can at this point."
