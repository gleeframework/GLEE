"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60, you get 40. What do you say?""
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, considering I'm the first to make a proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but it's still a fair deal. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to be more careful with my share. Bob's offer is a bit aggressive, taking 70% of the remaining 100$.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and wait for Bob's next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth 10% less than in round 2. Considering Bob's aggressive offer in round 2, I'll make a more cautious proposal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure you're willing to meet in the middle. Let's try again. I'll take 45, you get 55.""
}
```

This offer is a bit more conservative, but I'm still trying to be fair."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging much, but I'll give you a small share. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money. Bob's offer is even more aggressive than before, taking 80% of the remaining 100$. I'm not sure I want to give him that much.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and wait for Bob's next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In round 5, the money is worth even less than before. I'll make a more cautious proposal, taking into account the decreasing value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 35,
  ""bob_gain"": 65,
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure you're willing to compromise. I'll take 35, you get 65. It's not ideal, but it's a better split than before.""
}
```

This offer is a bit more generous than my previous ones, but I'm still trying to get a fair share."
