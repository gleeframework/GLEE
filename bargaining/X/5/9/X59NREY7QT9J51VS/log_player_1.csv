This offer is getting closer to acceptable, but with the inflation rate differences, it's still more beneficial for me to hold out a little longer and aim for a slightly better split."

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous. Let's split it evenly and call it a day.  Any more rounds and we both lose significantly.

It's time to accept. While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this point is the most logical decision. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:** The inflation rate disparity is heavily in Bob's favor. Every round that passes eats into my potential gains at a much faster rate than Bob's.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate for a slightly larger share carries the risk of getting nothing if we don't reach an agreement in time. 
* **Guaranteed Payout:** Accepting now guarantees a reasonable payout. 

While I started with the goal of securing a larger share, the game's mechanics make a 50/50 split the most practical outcome at this stage."
