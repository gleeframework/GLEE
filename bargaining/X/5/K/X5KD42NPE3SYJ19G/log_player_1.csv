I'm starting with a generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a deal quickly.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob is being incredibly greedy! I'll reject this offer and see if he'll compromise in the next round.  The inflation is a factor, but I'm not going to settle for such an unfair deal so early in the game."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to be more balanced, but still aiming for a good share.  I believe this is a reasonable compromise given the inflation factor and the need to reach an agreement before too many rounds pass."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still being very stubborn.  The inflation is starting to bite, but I'm not going to give in to his unreasonable demands just yet. I'll continue to fight for a fairer share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm increasing my offer again, hoping to find a middle ground.  The inflation is becoming a serious concern, but I'm still trying to be fair. I believe this offer shows that I'm willing to compromise while still securing a decent portion of the money."
