I'm going to try to get the most I can in this round.  Since I have 12 rounds to make this work, I'm willing to be a little generous with Bob, hoping he'll accept.  Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

While I'd prefer more,  inflation is a real risk.  Taking a 50/50 split is the best way to guarantee I get something, especially with the risk that Bob might be more aggressive in the following rounds."
