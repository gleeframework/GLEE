# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more. 55-45 is the lowest I can go. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Even with inflation, Bob's offer is still heavily skewed in his favor.  I need to hold out for a better deal, as time is on my side in this negotiation. Bob's share is losing value rapidly, making him more likely to concede in future rounds."
