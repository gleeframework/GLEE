"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. 60/40 split seems reasonable for a quick agreement. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4500,
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""Your offer was a bit too much in your favor, Alice. How about we meet in the middle? This offer ensures we both benefit from a quick resolution.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is ticking, and inflation is eating away at our potential gains. I'm willing to adjust my offer slightly, but I need you to meet me halfway. This is a fair deal considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is right about time pressure, she's feeling the impact of inflation more than I am. I can afford to be a bit more patient and see if she's willing to make a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4700,
""alice_gain"": 5300,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm aiming for a fair deal. This offer acknowledges the time pressure and gives us both a reasonable share.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but the clock is ticking and inflation is hurting my potential gains. This offer is a compromise, and I urge you to accept it before time runs out on us both. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of inflation, and her offers are creeping towards a more even split. While this offer is tempting, I believe holding out for one more round could lead to an even better outcome for me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time and split this evenly.  A 50/50 split is the fairest option and ensures we both walk away with something substantial.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Now that we're past the halfway point, it's time to push for a truly even split.  Alice is feeling the pressure of inflation, and offering 50/50 now emphasizes fairness while still giving me the best chance of maximizing my gains. Delaying further could lead to rushed decisions and less favorable outcomes for both of us."
