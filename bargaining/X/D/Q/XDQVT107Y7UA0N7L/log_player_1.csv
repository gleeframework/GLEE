"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept and we can finalize the deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can wrap things up quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, this is a good starting point. I'm open to negotiation, but we need to work together to make this work. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not impressed with Bob's offer. I think I can do better than that. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to give you the majority of the money. Let's try to find a better balance.""
}
```

I'm not ready to give up yet, and I think I can negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's make a deal!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a more balanced split, but I'm still trying to get a slightly larger share."
