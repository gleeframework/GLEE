"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. This is a 60/40 split, hope you think it's reasonable. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nReasoning: Since the money is worth 20% less for me with each passing round, I want to try to get a better deal. A 60/40 split might be reasonable in a normal situation, but considering the inflation, I think I can get a better offer in the next round. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think 55/45 is a fair split.""}\n\nReasoning: Since the money is worth 20% less for me with each passing round, I want to try to get a better deal than Alice's initial 60/40 split. I'm hoping that Alice will accept a 55/45 split, which is still relatively fair but takes into account the fact that the money is losing value for me over time. Let's see how Alice responds!"
