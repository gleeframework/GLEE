"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  This is a good starting point, as it gives Bob a small amount, while still leaving me with the majority.  Since the money will be worth less in the next round, it's in his best interest to accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject this offer. While the money is worth less, I'm still losing a significant amount compared to my initial proposal. It's worth risking another round to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I propose an 85/15 split in my favor. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still gives me a majority share.  Since the money continues to lose value with each round, I believe this is a fair offer that Bob will be inclined to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I accept this offer. While the money is worth significantly less now, and I'm getting a smaller share than my initial offer, it's not worth risking another round. Inflation is hurting me much more than Bob, and I'm likely to lose more if we continue."
