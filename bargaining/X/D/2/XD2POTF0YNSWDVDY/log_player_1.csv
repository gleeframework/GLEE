"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 70-30, I'll take the smaller share this round to test your strategy""
}
```

This is a relatively small offer for me, so I'm curious to see how Bob will respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous this round, but let's see how this plays out.   
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, I'll have to be more careful with my decision.

Since my gain is worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 20% less, I'll have to weigh the benefits of accepting this offer.

Considering the relatively large difference in the proposed split, I'll decide to reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Now it's my turn again. Since Bob's offer was 60-40, I'll try to adjust my offer accordingly. I'll make a slightly more aggressive proposal, taking into account the inflation effect.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""You were too generous last round, I'm taking a bit more this time""
}
```"
