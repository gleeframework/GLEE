"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 70-30, I'll take the smaller share this round to test your strategy 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

It's always better to see what Alice's strategy is before accepting a deal. If she's being generous in this round, maybe she'll be even more generous in the next round if I reject. Plus, inflation is working in my favor - waiting a round will make her offer worth more to me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I'm feeling generous this round, but let's see how this plays out.  ""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You were too generous last round, I'm taking a bit more this time 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I'm not sure how much more she's willing to push it. My gains are worth less now due to inflation, and it's unlikely she'll offer more in the next round. It's time to secure what I can."
