"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer benefits both of us. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, my turn.  I think this is a fair offer considering the inflation working against you.  Let's wrap this up.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a better offer than your last, especially with inflation looming. Let's settle and avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```
Alice's offer is now better than what I could get in round 4 even if I got 100% of the diminished pot.   It's time to accept.
