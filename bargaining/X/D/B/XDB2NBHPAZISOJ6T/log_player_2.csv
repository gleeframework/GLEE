Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value fast, take this before it's too late 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The relentless march of inflation has put Bob in a difficult position. While accepting anything less than a 50/50 split feels unfair, the value of his potential gains is eroding rapidly. 

Let's analyze:

* **Round 1:** Alice offered 40/60 - unacceptable.
* **Round 2:** Bob countered with a generous 55/45 - rejected. 
* **Round 3:**  Alice offered a slightly better 42/58 - still unacceptable as inflation was eating into Bob's share.
* **Round 4:**  Bob pushed for a fair 50/50 - also rejected.

Now, in Round 5, Bob is looking at a 43/57 split.  While not ideal, this is the best offer he's likely to get. If he rejects this, he risks walking away with even less in the next round due to the brutal inflation. 

**Key Takeaway:**  This game illustrates the power dynamic in situations with asymmetric information and how time pressure can lead to settling for less than ideal outcomes."
