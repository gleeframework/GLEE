"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer is in your best interest if we want to avoid inflation eating away at our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
I'm going to see if I can get a better deal for myself in the next round.  Let's see what Alice proposes!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think this is a fair split, Alice.  We can both walk away happy with a decent amount of money.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic.  The longer this goes on, the more we both lose. This offer still gives you a decent share, but time is of the essence! 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a bigger share, the inflation is hitting hard, and accepting this offer is still a better outcome than risking a worse deal in the next round."
