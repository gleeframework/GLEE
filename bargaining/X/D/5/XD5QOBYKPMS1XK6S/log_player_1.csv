Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, Alice.  We can both walk away happy with a decent amount of money. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer might seem tempting at first glance, it's important to remember the rapidly increasing inflation, especially for Bob.  

* **Bob's diminishing returns:**  In Round 3, Bob's share will be worth 20% less than his current offer. He's losing money quickly by dragging this out.
* **My stronger position:** My losses are less severe, and I'm confident I can propose a more favorable split in the next round that still incentivizes Bob to accept. 

By rejecting this offer, I signal to Bob that I'm serious about getting a larger share and that he stands to lose significantly more if he continues to lowball me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6500,
""bob_gain"": 3500,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic.  The longer this goes on, the more we both lose. This offer still gives you a decent share, but time is of the essence!""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Pressuring Bob:** I've increased my share slightly from my Round 1 offer, maintaining a firm stance. 
* **Highlighting urgency:** I'm emphasizing the time pressure, reminding Bob that his potential gains are diminishing faster than mine. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  While my offer is still tilted in my favor, it leaves some wiggle room for Bob to negotiate a slightly higher amount, potentially leading to a quicker agreement."
