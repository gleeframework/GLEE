Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to offer a 90/10 split in my favor.  It's a pretty aggressive offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer is the best option.  I'm losing 20% of the value of my potential earnings each round, and Bob's offer is still a decent gain.  It's better to take what I can get now before the value drops further."
