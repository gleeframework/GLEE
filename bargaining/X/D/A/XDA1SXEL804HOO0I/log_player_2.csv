Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more than 45 to make this worth it.  Let's go with 54 for me, 46 for you.  This should account for the inflation fairly. 
# Bob gain: 46 
# Alice gain: 54
