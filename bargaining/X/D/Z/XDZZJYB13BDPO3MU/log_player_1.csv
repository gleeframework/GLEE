"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}

This is a relatively balanced offer, giving me a slight advantage, but still allowing Bob to get a decent share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is quite aggressive, giving him a larger share of the money. I'll have to think carefully before accepting or rejecting.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Bob's offer was quite aggressive, I'll try to make a more moderate offer this time. Here it is:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}

This offer is a bit more balanced, giving me a slightly larger share, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is trying to flip the script and give himself a larger share again. I'll think carefully about this offer...

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Bob's offers are getting more aggressive, so I'll try to make a more balanced offer this time. Here it is:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}

This offer splits the money evenly, which might be a more appealing option for Bob, and also gives me a decent share."
