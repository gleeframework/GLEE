I propose a 900k/100k split. I'm confident I can get a better deal in future rounds, but I want to start with a fair, generous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}

I'm raising my share slightly to 850k, but still offering a significant portion to Bob. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the inflation."
