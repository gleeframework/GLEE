"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but the inflation significantly impacts me. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor to counterbalance the loss in value I'm facing. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```
At this point, accepting is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:**  Alice is correct; inflation is hitting her hard. While the nominal value seems high, she's actually getting significantly less in real terms.
* **Future Uncertainty:**  If I reject this offer, there's no guarantee I can secure a better deal in the next round. Alice's offers might get less favorable as the value diminishes for her.
* **Reasonable Compromise:** A 45/55 split isn't ideal, but it's better than risking a worse outcome in a future round. 

It's a good moment to secure a reasonable, albeit not perfect, deal.
