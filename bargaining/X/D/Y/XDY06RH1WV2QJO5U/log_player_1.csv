Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start by being generous, hoping Bob will see the value in a quick resolution.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more,  accepting this offer ensures I get something.  The inflation is a risk, and with 10 rounds left, I don't want to risk getting nothing."
