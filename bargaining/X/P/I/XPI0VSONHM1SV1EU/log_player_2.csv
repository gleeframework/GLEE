# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I reject this offer. Although it seems ""fair"" on the surface, I know that the money will be worth less in future rounds, and I can potentially get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I propose a slightly more even split, taking into account the future devaluation of the money.  Let's aim for a win-win.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, this is a fair deal. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's offer does consider inflation, it's still not advantageous for me. I know the money will continue to devalue, and I can likely secure a more favorable deal in the future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's try to reach an agreement. I'm offering a generous split that accounts for the continued inflation. It's in our best interest to divide the money before it loses even more value.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We need to find a middle ground to stop losing value. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Alice's offer is closer to my desired split, it still doesn't reflect the significant devaluation of the money. I believe I can still get a better deal in the future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6500, ""alice_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""We're running out of time! I'm offering a final concession, but I won't go lower. Let's agree before the value of the money drops even further.""}
