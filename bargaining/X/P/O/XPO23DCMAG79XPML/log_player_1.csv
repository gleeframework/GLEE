I propose a 99/1 split in my favor. I figure Bob might be willing to accept a small amount to avoid getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

A 50/50 split is a fair deal, and even though the money is worth less now, it's better than getting nothing at all."
