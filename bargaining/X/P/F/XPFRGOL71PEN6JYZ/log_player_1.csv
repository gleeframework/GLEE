"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that. Let's split it 60-40, with me taking the larger share this time. This is a fair compromise, and we can avoid any further rounds. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best option. If I reject it, I will have to make an offer in the next round, but with inflation, my gains will be worth less. Additionally, it is unknown how much Bob's gains will be diminished by inflation, making it risky to continue.  Accepting the offer ensures I get at least some money, and it avoids potential losses."
