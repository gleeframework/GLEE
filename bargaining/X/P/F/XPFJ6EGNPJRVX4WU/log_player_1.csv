Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'll start by offering a 60/40 split in my favor. Since this is the first round, the money is worth the same for both of us, so I'm aiming for a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting the 50/50 split is the best option. In the next round, Bob's gains would be worth even less, and I might not get as good a deal."
