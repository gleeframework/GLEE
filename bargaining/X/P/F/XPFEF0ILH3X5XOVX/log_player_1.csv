"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $200,000. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000, which is a relatively small portion, leaving me with $800,000. My message is a friendly one, inviting Bob to make a counteroffer or accept my proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'd like to propose a more equitable split. Let's each take 60% and 40% respectively. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, Bob's offer is now worth less to him than it would have been in the first round.

I'm not too thrilled about the 60-40 split, as it's not as favorable to me as I'd like. However, it's still a better offer than what I got in the first round, and I'm eager to get some money.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
