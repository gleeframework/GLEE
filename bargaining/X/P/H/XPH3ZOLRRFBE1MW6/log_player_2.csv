# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll wait for a better offer. The current offer doesn't seem fair to me, and I believe I can get a more favorable division in the next rounds. I'm willing to take the risk of the money being worth less in the future in hopes of getting a larger share.\n\n###\n\nPlease relay my decision to Alice and let's proceed to the next round. I'm excited to see her next offer!"

# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll wait for a better offer. Although the inflation is taking its toll, I still believe I can negotiate a more favorable division.

I'm hoping she'll understand the impact of inflation on my share and accept this proposal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, the clock is ticking and the value for you keeps dropping.  I'm holding firm at $6400.  Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 3600 
# Alice gain: 6400 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll accept this offer. Although the inflation has significantly reduced the value of my share, I believe further negotiations will only lead to more loss due to the decreasing value of the money. Alice's offer seems firm, and I don't want to risk getting nothing if we fail to reach an agreement within the 12 rounds.\n\n###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}"
