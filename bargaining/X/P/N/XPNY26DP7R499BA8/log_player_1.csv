Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous, now it's my turn to be generous 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly this time. My offer is a counter to your last one.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too greedy last time, now it's my turn to be greedy 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Even though the inflation has significantly decreased my share, it's better to take this offer than risk getting nothing if I reject. It's better to have 400,000 than nothing at all."
