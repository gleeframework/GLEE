Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I want to see what Alice's second offer is. This is a good starting point to gauge her strategy."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly. This offer is a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob. This offer is closer to your previous proposal, but still gives me a decent share. 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
This offer is closer to what I wanted and it's a good deal considering the inflation.  Let's end this before we lose too much value."
