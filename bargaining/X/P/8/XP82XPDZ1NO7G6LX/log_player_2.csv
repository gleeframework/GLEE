**Reasoning:**

Alice is feeling the pressure of the inflation and is moving closer to a more even split.  While she may be getting desperate, I think I can squeeze out a slightly better deal in the next couple of rounds."

**Reasoning:**

The tide has turned.  Alice is now offering more than I was proposing last round. Accepting now guarantees a reasonable payout before her offers potentially drop further due to the steep inflation she's facing."
