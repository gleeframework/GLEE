"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable. This offer still gives you a significant sum.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to be fair, Alice, but your last offer wasn't reasonable given the inflation. Let's find a better balance. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""Bob, time is running out for both of us. This is my final offer before the effects of inflation make this pointless.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer.  We both lose if this goes any further.  Let's be done with this. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 
 
While not ideal, Bob's offer is better than letting the game go to another round.  The longer the game goes on, the less beneficial it is for me.  At this rate, I'll be losing more to inflation than I would by accepting his offer."
