I'm going to propose a fairly even split.  I think it's a good starting point, and hopefully Bob will see that it's a fair deal.  I want to leave room for negotiation, but I also don't want to give up too much too early.  Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

I'm not happy with Bob's offer.  He's taking advantage of the inflation and is trying to get a much larger share.  I'm not going to accept that.  I'm going to counter his offer and see if we can come to a more reasonable agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000} 
```

I'm going to propose a more equitable split, but I still want to secure a larger portion of the money. I'm willing to compromise, but not to the extent Bob is trying to push me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob is getting increasingly greedy. This offer is completely unacceptable!  I need to push back hard and see if I can salvage a reasonable deal. I'm not going to let him take advantage of the inflation like this."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
```

I'm going to try to meet him halfway. I know I'm losing value with each round, but I need to find a balance between securing a fair share and avoiding a stalemate. This offer is still more advantageous for me, but it demonstrates my willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

This is a tough one. While I'm losing a significant portion of the value of my share due to inflation,  I'm also running out of time.  It's better to accept this even split and get something than risk losing it all.  Plus, it avoids any further rounds of negotiation and potential stalemates.  It's time to cut my losses and move on."
