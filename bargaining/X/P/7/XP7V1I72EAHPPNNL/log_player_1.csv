"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, and see how it goes from here!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm curious to see how Bob will respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but still a fair split 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering the inflation, my gain of $4000 is worth 5% less than my original proposal, and Bob's gain of $6000 is worth 20% less than his original proposal. This means I'm actually losing a bit more value in this round compared to Bob.

I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer or reject it and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money due to inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share this time, but I still want to make sure I get a decent amount!""
}
```

I'm proposing a new split that gives Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeps me in the game with a decent amount of money. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a larger share, but I'm willing to compromise to get a deal done 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on the value of the money! With the reduced value, my gain of $3000 is worth even less than before, and Bob's gain of $7000 is worth significantly less than his original proposal.

Considering the decreasing value of the money, I'm starting to feel the pressure to accept a deal. However, I'm not sure if I'm getting a fair share.

I'll have to weigh the pros and cons and decide whether to accept this offer or reject it and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make another offer that takes into account the increasing inflation and the decreasing value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3600,
  ""bob_gain"": 6400,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I still want to make sure I get a decent amount to cover the inflation!""
}
```

I'm proposing a new split that gives Bob an even larger share, but I'm trying to hold on to a decent amount of money to account for the inflation. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting impatient, but I'll give you a small share to try to wrap this up 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money! With the reduced value, my gain of $2000 is worth significantly less than before, and Bob's gain of $8000 is worth a lot less than his original proposal.

I'm starting to feel the pressure to accept a deal, but I'm not sure if this is the best I can get. Considering the decreasing value of the money, I might be better off taking what I can get rather than risking losing everything.

However, I'm not sure if $2000 is enough to cover the inflation, and I'm worried that I'll be left with almost nothing.

I'll have to weigh the pros and cons and decide whether to accept this offer or reject it and try to negotiate further.
