"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

This offer aims to secure a large portion of the money early on, even with potential inflation. The logic is that Bob is likely to accept this offer rather than risk getting nothing if he rejects and the game continues."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though I'm likely getting less than I was in the first round, accepting this offer guarantees me a significant amount of money.  It's risky to keep rejecting offers as inflation could erode the value of the remaining money further. It's better to secure a good share now."
