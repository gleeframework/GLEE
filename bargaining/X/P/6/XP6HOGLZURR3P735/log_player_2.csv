"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly considering future loss. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer seems ""fair"" on the surface, it actually heavily favors her in the long run due to the inflation rates.  Here's why:

* **My Loss:** I lose 10% per round. Accepting $400,000 now means missing out on potential gains if I hold out for a better offer in the next few rounds.
* **Alice's Gain:** She loses only 5% per round. Getting $600,000 now is a great deal for her, even if the total amount decreases slightly in later rounds.

I need to aim for a split that accounts for the difference in inflation rates and secures me a better portion of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 480000,
""alice_gain"": 520000,
""message"": ""I understand your proposal, but the inflation rates hurt me more. This offer is fairer considering the long term losses."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Accounting for Inflation:** I've adjusted the split to reflect the unequal inflation rates. While this offer still gives Alice a larger portion, it's a smaller advantage than her initial proposal.
* **Early Negotiation:**  It's early in the game. Offering a slightly better deal for Alice encourages her to consider settling quickly, rather than risking her share shrinking in later rounds.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** I've left some room for negotiation.  If Alice rejects this offer, I can still adjust my position in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the impact of inflation, I've adjusted my offer. This is a fair split given the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to sweeten the deal, but her offer is still not favorable to me. Here's why:

* **Not Adjusting Enough:**  While she claims to acknowledge the inflation, the adjustment is minimal. The difference between her gain and my loss is still significant. 
* **Time Pressure Tactic:**  Alice is likely hoping the shrinking pot will pressure me into accepting a bad deal. However, I'm willing to hold out for a more equitable split, even if it means the total amount decreases. 

I need to send a strong signal that I'm serious about a fair division, even if it means letting a few more rounds pass."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Let's be realistic. A 50/50 split is the only fair option considering the inflation we both face. I'm willing to accept this now to avoid further losses for both of us."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct Approach:** I'm shifting to a more direct strategy.  Three rounds of offers indicate that Alice is unlikely to agree to a split that heavily favors me, even if it's mathematically fairer in the long run.
* **Appearing Reasonable:**  By proposing a 50/50 split, I appear open to compromise and highlight the shared loss caused by continued inflation. This might make Alice more receptive than if I continue to counter with slightly better offers for myself.
* **Time Sensitivity:**  We're now past the halfway point, and the value of the money is decreasing significantly with each round. It's time to push for a resolution, even if it means accepting an equal split."
