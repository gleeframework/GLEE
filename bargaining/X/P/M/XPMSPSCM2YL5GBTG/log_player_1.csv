I propose to take $9,000 and leave Bob with $1,000. This is a good starting point as it gives me a significant share while still being reasonable.  Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation is a significant factor.  This offer gives me a decent amount of money, and accepting means the game ends. Rejecting means we go to another round, and my share could be even smaller then. It's better to take what I can get now."
