"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

This way, I'll get 70% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob will get 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making a decision.

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll try to get a better deal. Bob's offer is still quite close to the original 60-40 split, but I'll try to negotiate further.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, I'll aim for a slightly higher percentage to compensate for the decrease in value.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 650000,
  ""bob_gain"": 350000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth significantly less now due to inflation. I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth less, I'll aim to get a higher percentage to compensate. However, Bob's offer is still a relatively even split, and I don't want to risk getting nothing if I reject it.

I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 4.
