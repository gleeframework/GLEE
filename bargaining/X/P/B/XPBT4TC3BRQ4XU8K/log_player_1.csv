"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

I'm proposing that I receive $7,000 and Bob receives $3,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my decision accordingly.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take $6,000 and Bob will take $4,000."
