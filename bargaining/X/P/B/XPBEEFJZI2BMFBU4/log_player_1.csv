Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

Let's see if Bob is willing to accept a 90/10 split in my favor.  I'm aiming for a good starting point and will adjust my offers based on Bob's responses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is fair, but I'm hoping to get a little more than 50%.  I'll reject his offer and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor.  Since the money is worth less now due to inflation, I'm hoping to get a slightly better deal than before."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still hoping to get a better deal.  Bob's offer is getting worse, and I think I can get a more favorable outcome.  I'll reject and see if he's willing to budge."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

I'm offering a 55/45 split in my favor. I've noticed a trend of Bob lowering his offers, so I'm trying to meet him halfway while still getting a decent share. The inflation is starting to hurt, so I need to secure a good amount before it gets worse."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly unfavorable.  While the inflation is biting, I'm still not willing to settle for such a low share.  I'll reject and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

Inflation is hitting hard, and I need to secure something before it's too late. I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair compromise given the circumstances.  I hope Bob will see reason and accept this offer."
