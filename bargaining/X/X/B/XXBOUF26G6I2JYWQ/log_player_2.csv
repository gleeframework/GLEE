Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet in the middle? 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation working against her.  While her offer is closer to even, it's still skewed in her favor considering the value of the money decreases for her each round. I believe I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Time is running out, and the value is decreasing for both of us. This offer is fair and prevents us from losing even more to inflation.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conceding slightly:** I'm moving a little closer to Alice's desired split to show willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting the shared risk:** Emphasizing the shrinking pot due to inflation might make Alice more receptive to a deal. 
* **Time pressure:** As we approach the halfway point, the pressure to settle increases. This offer attempts to capitalize on that."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting closer, don't let inflation win 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to use psychological tactics (""don't let inflation win""), but her offer is still not accounting for the significant impact inflation is having on her share.  She needs to move closer to a 50/50 split for it to be acceptable at this stage."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5100, ""alice_gain"": 4900, ""message"": ""Let's be realistic, Alice. This is practically a 50/50 split considering how much the money is losing value for you.  Take the deal before it shrinks further.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight concession, strong stance:** I'm reducing my demand slightly again to show flexibility, but my message is firm.  Alice needs to understand that time is working against her more than me.
* **Emphasizing the shrinking value:** By highlighting the real impact of inflation on her share, I'm hoping Alice will see the logic in accepting a near-even split.
* **Urgency:**  With fewer rounds left, the risk of walking away with nothing increases. This offer reiterates the need for a decision soon."
