"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you 40%!""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fairer to split it 60/40 in my favor, given that you'll keep all of your money while mine is worth 5% less each round. Let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't think it's fair for me to accept an offer that gives me less than I proposed in the first round, especially since the money I gain is not decreasing in value.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60/40 in his favor, I'll try to counter with a 55/45 split in my favor. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You wanted 60/40, I'll give you 45% - take it or leave it!""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable, Alice. We both lose money if we keep going, so let's split it down the middle and call it a day. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","A 50/50 split is a reasonable proposal, especially considering the inflation is affecting Bob's share more significantly. I think it's a fair compromise.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
