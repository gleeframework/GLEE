"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take the larger share, but I'm willing to compromise.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000. I'm framing it as a compromise, hoping Bob will accept it and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair, considering the potential for inflation. Let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I'll have to be careful. Since Bob's offer is a 60/40 split, I'll end up with $400,000, which is worth 80% of the original $500,000 (due to 20% inflation from round 1 to round 2).

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. The 60/40 split seems reasonable, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject this offer for now and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll make a new offer. Since Bob's offer in round 2 was a 60/40 split, I'll try to negotiate a better deal for myself.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the risk of inflation.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, hoping Bob will accept it and we can end the game."
