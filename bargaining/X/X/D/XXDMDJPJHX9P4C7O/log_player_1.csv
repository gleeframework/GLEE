"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start, no need for a long game""
}
```

This way, we both get $5,000 each, and we can see how the game plays out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still not willing to give up too much 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 10% less for Bob, his offer is actually:

* Alice gain: 4000
* Bob gain: 5400 (not 6000, since 6000 is 10% more than 5400)

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
