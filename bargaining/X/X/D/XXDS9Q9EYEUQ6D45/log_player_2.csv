"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. It's a fair deal for the first round. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm Bob, and I'm not happy with a 60/40 split in Alice's favor. I'll try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, I think a 55/45 split is more fair. Let's start off with a more even distribution.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable. This is my counter offer. It accounts for the time pressure and is still generous towards you. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
I'm happy to accept this offer.  While I would prefer a more even split, the time pressure is real, and it's better to get something than nothing."
