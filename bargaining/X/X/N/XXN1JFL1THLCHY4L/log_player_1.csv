"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, Alice proposes to take $60 and leave $40 for Bob, with a message suggesting they should be reasonable and accept this fairly generous offer, considering the progressive devaluation of the money in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a larger share, but this is a fairer split considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not satisfied with this offer. Considering the inflation, I still believe I can get a better deal in the next round. Let's proceed!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm being generous. Take it before it's too late!""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I'm taking into account the progressive devaluation of the money and trying to persuade Bob that accepting this offer is wise, given that further rounds will only decrease the value of the money for both of us, but more so for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the fairest option.  The value will only decrease further. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant decrease in value for both of us and Bob's firm stance, I believe accepting the 50/50 split at this point is the wisest decision to make. Further rounds would only diminish the value of the money even more, likely leading to a worse outcome for me."
