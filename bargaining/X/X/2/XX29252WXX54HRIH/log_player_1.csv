"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take 60% and you can have 40%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'm starting low, let's meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, so I need to be more cautious.

I'm not willing to accept Bob's offer, as it's still heavily skewed in his favor. I'll reject it and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, 50-50 split, no more games""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which should be more appealing to Bob."
