Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting desperate, but we can hold out for a better deal.  The inflation is significantly eroding her gains each round, making her offers increasingly worse for her. Let's see if she gets more realistic in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's end this. I'm offering a straight 50/50 split.  It's the fairest deal considering the circumstances.  Take it before inflation eats away at your share even more.""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** We are past the halfway point, and Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the shrinking pot from her perspective.  Offering an even split now increases the chances she'll accept to avoid getting even less later. 
* **Appearing Reasonable:**  After rejecting her previous offers, coming down to an even split might make Bob appear more reasonable and willing to compromise, increasing the likelihood of Alice accepting. 
* **Inflation Factor:**  Even though this is a 50/50 split of the nominal amount, due to the inflation for Alice, Bob is effectively getting a better deal than previous rounds."
