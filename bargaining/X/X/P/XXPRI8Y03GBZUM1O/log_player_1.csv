"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a chance to accept or reject""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $20, which is 20% of the original $100. I'm keeping $80, which is 80% of the original $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more balanced split is fairer.  Let's aim for something closer to the middle. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $45 is worth 95% of the original $80 I was offered in the first round, which is $76.

Bob's gain of $55 is worth 50% of the original $20 he was offered in the first round, which is $10.

I'm inclined to accept Bob's offer, as it's a more balanced split. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
