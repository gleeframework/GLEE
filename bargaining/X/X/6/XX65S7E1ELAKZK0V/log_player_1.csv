"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount of money, and the game can end quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but it's still a good deal for you! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to be more careful with my share.

I'll reject this offer. The 30$ I would get is not enough, considering the reduced value due to inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll aim for a higher share to compensate for the loss.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and make a fair deal. No need to negotiate further.""
}
```"
