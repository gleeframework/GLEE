"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a very aggressive strategy to start. This will hopefully incentivize Bob to accept the offer quickly, as his chances of getting more diminish significantly in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999998, ""bob_gain"": 2}
```

I'm continuing with an aggressive strategy. While it's unlikely Bob will accept this offer, I want to ensure he understands that the power shifts with each passing round, and his chances of getting a large share are rapidly decreasing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2 
# Bob gain: 999998 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999997, ""bob_gain"": 3}
```

I'm continuing the pattern, but with smaller increments. Bob is clearly trying to get a huge share, but he's not willing to compromise. My strategy is to push the boundaries, reminding him that each rejection makes his position less favorable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3 
# Bob gain: 999997

Round 7

I'm still sticking to the pattern of increasing Bob's gain by 1, but now we're getting closer to the middle ground. I'm hoping this will make Bob reconsider his strategy and perhaps start accepting offers before it's too late."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4 
# Bob gain: 999996 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm still not willing to accept such a small share. I'm confident that I can get a better deal. We are now getting into the later rounds, which means Bob's position is becoming more desperate. I need to maintain my strategy and keep pushing for a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999995, ""bob_gain"": 5}
```

We're getting close to the end, and Bob's greed is making him miss out on a decent share. My strategy is still to slowly increase Bob's share, reminding him that he's risking everything for a small gain. I believe this will make him think twice in the upcoming rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 999995 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still sticking to my strategy of rejecting Bob's offers and slowly increasing his share. We are in the final stages of the game, and Bob's position is becoming even more precarious. I believe this will finally force him to compromise in the next few rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999994, ""bob_gain"": 6}
```

It's crunch time. Bob is definitely feeling the pressure, as we're nearing the end of the game. I'm continuing my strategy of increasing Bob's share slightly but keeping the majority for myself. This round is crucial, as I'm trying to get Bob to understand that accepting my offer is the only way for him to get anything at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6 
# Bob gain: 999994 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm sticking to my strategy! I'm not going to give in to Bob's last-minute desperation.  I'm confident I can secure a better deal than this. He's been unwilling to budge, and now we're both facing the consequences. I'm not afraid to walk away and get nothing, rather than settle for such a small share."
