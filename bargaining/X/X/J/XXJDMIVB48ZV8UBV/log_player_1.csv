"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, with me taking the larger share since I'm the one making the offer this round.  Let's see if you agree.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to go down to a 55/45 split, but I'm sticking with my higher share.  It's getting risky to keep rejecting offers with inflation ticking up.

**Reasoning:** Bob is being stubborn and trying to exploit the situation. While the time pressure is on, accepting a deal that heavily favors him sets a bad precedent. I believe I can still negotiate a better outcome."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5250, ""bob_gain"": 4750, ""message"": ""Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm proposing a 52.5/47.5 split - it's a small concession on my part, and shows I'm willing to compromise. Let's close this deal before we both lose out.""}"
