Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try splitting it evenly again. Inflation is hurting us both, and this seems like the fairest solution. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Even with inflation, I need to push for a better split. While time is running out, accepting a 50/50 split now means I'm losing a significant chunk of the initial value due to the higher inflation I'm experiencing. I'll try to incentivize Alice to agree to a slightly better deal for me before time runs out."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 53, ""alice_gain"": 47, ""message"": ""Time is running out, and we both lose if we don't agree. This is a small edge for me but better than nothing for both of us.""}

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give a small concession, but I think we can reach a more even split. Let's try again. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a critical point. While Alice is offering a concession, the deal is still not favorable considering the inflation disparity. I need to hold out for a slightly better offer, even if it means risking everything in the later rounds."

{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Alice, this is the best I can do. We need to settle this now before the money becomes practically worthless.""}
