6000.0,4000.0,Let's split the money 60/40.  A fair deal for both of us to start.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"I think we should split it 60/40, with me getting the larger share. I'm willing to negotiate further if you think this is unfair.",Bob,2,
,,"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob, but that split seems heavily skewed in your favor, especially considering the inflation working against us both. Let's find something more equitable.",Alice,2,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Okay, Bob, let's be realistic. How about 55/45?  It's a slight advantage for me considering the inflation is hitting you harder, but still a decent chunk for both of us.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4500.0,5500.0,Let's compromise.  I'm willing to accept 55/45. It's fair considering the inflation impacting us both.  Let's make a deal.,Bob,4,
,,"This is starting to feel like a game of chicken, Bob.  You're just echoing my previous offer, knowing the inflation hurts you more each round.  I'm willing to be reasonable, but I need to see some real compromise.",Alice,4,reject
5250.0,4750.0,"Bob, this back and forth is helping neither of us.  I'm dropping my offer slightly to 52.5/47.5.  It acknowledges the inflation disparity while still giving us both a reasonable share.  Take it or let's stop wasting time.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,accept
