"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, no need to negotiate much""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to see if Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'll give you a decent share 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since I'm not sure about the inflation effect on Bob, I'll have to be cautious. Taking the majority and giving me a decent share is a good starting point, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject this offer to see if Bob will make a better one in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer in the previous round was 60/40, I'll try to improve my share. I'll propose a 55/45 split in my favor, which is a slight increase from my initial 50/50 proposal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll compromise and give you more, but I still want a decent chunk 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Bob's offer in the previous round was 60/40, and now he's offering me 60, it seems like he's trying to compromise. I'll accept this offer, as it's a significant improvement from his previous offer.
