"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good start""}\n\nI'll start by proposing a division of $6,000 for myself and $4,000 for Bob. I've also included a message to Bob, suggesting that this division is a fair starting point. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60-40 is more fair, with me getting the larger share this time. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'll have to take that into account when considering Bob's offer.

Considering the offer, I think I can do better than $4,000, even with the 5% decrease in value. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a new proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nLet's see what the next round brings!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll take into account the 5% decrease in value for my share. Let's try to find a mutually agreeable division.

{""alice_gain"": 5700, ""bob_gain"": 4300, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, 57-43 seems a reasonable compromise""}\n\nI've proposed a division of $5,700 for myself and $4,300 for Bob, taking into account the decreased value of my share due to inflation. Let's see how Bob responds!"
