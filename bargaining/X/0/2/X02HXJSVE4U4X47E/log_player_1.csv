"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose to take $999,999 and leave $1 for Bob.  This is a pretty aggressive opening offer, but I want to see if he'll accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
This is a fair offer, I'll accept.  It's better than getting nothing if we keep rejecting each other."
