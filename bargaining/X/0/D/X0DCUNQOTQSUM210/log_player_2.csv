"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fairly, considering my loss over time. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While the offer seems fair initially, I'm going to reject it. The game is about maximizing my gains, and considering the inflation factor, I can potentially do better by waiting and making my own offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I appreciate your fairness, Alice.  But I believe I can secure a better deal for myself with the inflation in my favor.  Let's see if you'll accept this offer.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, let's meet closer to the middle. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
I'm still going to reject the offer. While it's closer to the middle, the inflation factor is still working in my favor. I can likely secure a better deal for myself in a later round by waiting and making my own offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Alice, time is on my side now. I'm confident I can get a better deal if we keep going.  But let's see if you're willing to compromise before we reach the later rounds.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise further. 
# Bob gain: 5200 
# Alice gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

This offer is a good compromise considering the inflation factor.  I'm gaining a decent amount, and it's likely that if I continue to reject, the inflation will negatively impact Alice's offers further, making it harder to reach a mutually beneficial agreement in later rounds."
