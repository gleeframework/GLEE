"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair. I take the majority, but you get a decent starting amount. We can negotiate further if you'd like. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""That's not fair Alice. I'm proposing a more even split.  It's in your best interest to accept, given the inflation.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your point about fairness, Bob. Let's compromise. I'm willing to go down to 700k, but I need more than 400k to make it worthwhile. Inflation is a real factor, but we both need to be able to walk away with something substantial. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still getting the lion's share, and while her offer acknowledges the inflation, it doesn't reflect the urgency it places on *her* side of the deal.  We can push for a more equitable split."
