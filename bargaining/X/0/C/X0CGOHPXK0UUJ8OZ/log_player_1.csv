"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

This offer splits the money fairly, giving Alice a slightly larger share. This is a good starting point, as it allows for negotiation in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is worse than my previous proposal, even with inflation factored in. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

This time, I'm offering an even split. Since Bob rejected my previous offer, I think he might be willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Although Bob's offer is less favorable than the 50/50 split I proposed in the previous round, it's still a good outcome considering the significant inflation that has occurred. The difference between the offer and my previous proposal is less than the amount I've lost due to inflation."
