"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is a 60-40 split, which I think is a fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The tables have turned!

I'll think for a moment... 

I accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

The 40-60 split is a bit unfavorable to me, but I'm willing to accept it to end the game."
