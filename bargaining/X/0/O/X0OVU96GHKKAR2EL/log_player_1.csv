"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my first offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```
I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. Since the money I gain is worth the same as before, but Bob's gain is worth 10% less, this means I'm effectively getting a slightly larger share of the total value. However, I'm not sure if I want to settle for a slightly larger share now, rather than trying to negotiate for an even better deal in the future.

For now, I'll decide to reject this offer and see what Bob comes up with next.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. I'll try to make a counteroffer that's a bit more favorable to me, given that the money is still worth the same for me but less for Bob.

Here's my new offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```
I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which is a bit more in my favor than Bob's previous offer. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
