"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I take 60%, you take 40%. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
 
I'm Bob, and I'm not going to accept a 60/40 split right off the bat!  I'll see what Alice offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm offering a 55/45 split. It's a bit closer to even, and it's a good starting point for negotiation.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it down the middle this time. 50/50 is the fairest way to divide the money. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice's offer is a fair split, and given the inflation, I'm better off accepting now than risking another round and getting a worse deal."
