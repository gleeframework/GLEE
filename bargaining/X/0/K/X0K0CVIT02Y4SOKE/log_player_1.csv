Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, it's a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $100 equally, with each of us getting $50."

# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with the 40-60 split, as I feel I'm getting a relatively small share. I'd like to make a counteroffer to try to get a better deal."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of!""}

# Bob's message: I'm not giving up yet, let's see if you'll make a move! 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

Considering the inflation and the fact that the money is worth less than before, I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with the 42-58 split, as I feel I'm still getting a relatively small share. I'll try to make another counteroffer to try to get a better deal.

Next, I'll think about what I can offer to try to get a better split."

# Alice gain: 38 
# Bob gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

Considering the significant decrease in the value of the money due to inflation, I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with the 38-62 split, as I feel I'm getting a very small share. I'll try to make another counteroffer to try to get a better deal.

At this point, I'm starting to feel the pressure of the time limit and the effects of inflation. I need to make a strong move to get a better share of the money."
