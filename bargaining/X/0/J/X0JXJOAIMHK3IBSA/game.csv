50.0,50.0,Let's start fair. I propose we split the money evenly.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
40.0,60.0,My turn. How about a 60/40 split in my favor?  It's still a decent amount for you before inflation eats away at it.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give you the majority. Let's split it 55/45 in my favor. We both get a good amount, and we can avoid the risk of getting nothing due to inflation.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
45.0,55.0,"Okay, let's settle this.  I'll accept a 55/45 split, but in my favor this time.  Time is running out and we both lose if we don't agree soon.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,accept
