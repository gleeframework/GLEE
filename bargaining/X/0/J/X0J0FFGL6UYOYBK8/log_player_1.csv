Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a 90/10 split in my favor. I figure Bob might be willing to accept this in the first round, especially since he doesn't know about the inflation. Let's see what happens!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

While I'd prefer more, Bob's offer is still significantly better than what I'd get if we reach the end of the game with no agreement.  It's a good deal considering the inflation factor and the fact that he's taking a loss on his side."
