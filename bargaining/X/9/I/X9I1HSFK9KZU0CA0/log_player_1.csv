"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, but I'll take a slightly bigger share 
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is affecting us both!

After considering Bob's offer, I decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I accept Bob's offer of $5,800 for me and $4,200 for him. It's a fair compromise, and I'm willing to meet him halfway."
