"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80/20, a fair starting point?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping to negotiate a better deal in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can do better than that! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before accepting or rejecting the offer.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm still getting 80% of the original $10,000, which is $8,000. But I'm considering Bob's offer of $4,000, which is 40% of the original $10,000.

I'll reject this offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. I'll make a new proposal that's a bit more aggressive.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a small share, but I need a majority of the pie""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a very small share, hoping to get a better deal in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We should be closer now, but I still want a bit more 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values:

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm still getting 80% of the original $10,000, which is $8,000.

However, due to inflation, Bob's gain in this round is worth 27.1% less than the original $2,000, which is approximately $1,455.

Considering the values, I'm getting $8,000 and Bob is getting $4,545 (half of $9,000, which is the actual value of $10,000 after inflation).

I'll accept this offer, as it's a relatively fair split considering the inflation. 

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
