"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, Bob. I'll take 90% and you get 10%. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not accepting this offer. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. The current offer is too uneven, with Alice taking 90% of the money. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round, despite the 10% decrease in value due to inflation.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know when it's my turn to make an offer. I'll propose a more balanced split."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer to Alice. Since the money is worth 10% less to me now, I'll take that into account when making my offer. I'll propose a more balanced split, taking into account the decrease in value.\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering the inflation.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease relay this offer to Alice. I'm hoping she'll consider the effects of inflation and accept a more balanced split."
