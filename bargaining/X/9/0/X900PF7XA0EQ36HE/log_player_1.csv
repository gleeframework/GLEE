"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $70 and Bob gets $30. I'm framing it as a fair split, hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time. It's the fairest way to go, and we can both walk away happy. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effects of inflation, the new values are:

* My gain of $50 is worth 90% of $50 (since my gain was 10% less due to inflation), so it's equivalent to $45.
* Bob's gain of $50 is worth 80% of $50 (since his gain was 20% less due to inflation), so it's equivalent to $40.

I'm not sure if Bob's offer is still fair considering the inflation. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not convinced it's even after inflation. I'll make a new offer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the effects of inflation, the money is worth even less now. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll compromise on 60/40. It's still a fair split, considering the money's value is dropping.""
}
```

I'm proposing a slightly more favorable split for myself, but still trying to be reasonable."
