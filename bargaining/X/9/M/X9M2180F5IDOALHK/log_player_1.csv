"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This way, I'll get 55% of the initial amount, and Bob will get 45%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of 475,000 is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, which is equivalent to 522,500. Bob's gain of 525,000 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, which is 507,500.

Since my gain is still less than Bob's gain, I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, my new offer is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 490000,
  ""bob_gain"": 510000
}
```

This way, I'll get 49% of the initial amount, and Bob will get 51%."
