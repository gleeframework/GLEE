"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing to split the $100 equally between us, with each of us getting $50."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I deserve more than 40% of the total amount. I'll wait for the next round and try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. How about 55/45?""}

I'm increasing my proposed share to 55% and reducing Bob's share to 45%. Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 45, but I think I deserve a bit more now 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

Considering the inflation effect on Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about the 55% he's proposing for himself. However, I'm willing to compromise again.

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept Bob's offer this time, as it's not too far off from my previous proposal. I'll get 45% of the total amount, which is still a decent share. Let's hope this is the final round!"
