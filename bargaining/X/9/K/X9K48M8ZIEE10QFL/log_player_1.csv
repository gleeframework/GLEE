"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. Let's split it 60/40, with me taking the larger share this time. It's fair considering the inflation we'll have to deal with next round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
