"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to propose a very unequal split in my favor. This is a high-risk, high-reward strategy. If Bob rejects, I have the opportunity to make another offer in the next round.  However, if he accepts, I get the vast majority of the money!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a very similar strategy to what I used in the first round, just with the roles reversed. I will reject this offer and continue to try and get a more favorable deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm going to propose an even split this time.  Since we both rejected each other's highly unequal offers, it seems likely that we are both willing to compromise to avoid getting nothing at all."
