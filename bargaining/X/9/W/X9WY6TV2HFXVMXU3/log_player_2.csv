"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer ensures you get a good deal right away. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make my proposal. The current offer doesn't seem fair enough to me. I'm willing to take the risk of the money being worth less in the next round in hopes of getting a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's compromise, I've increased my share but you still get a significant amount.""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Time is money, Bob. I'll take a small hit from my previous offer, but let's close this deal now. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlthough the money is worth less now, I still believe I can negotiate for a better deal. Alice's offer has improved slightly, but not enough for me to accept it. I'll take the risk and wait for the next round to make another proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""I've considered the inflation impact, and I'm willing to take a bit more than before. This is a fair offer given the current situation.""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  Accept this offer, or we're both going to lose out significantly more. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on the value of the money, I think it's time to accept Alice's offer. The difference between our proposed amounts has narrowed, and further negotiations would likely result in even greater losses due to inflation. I'm willing to settle for this deal to minimize the loss of value."
