Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to try to be fair but also get a good share of the money.  I'm offering Bob $1,000, knowing that inflation will hurt him more in the next round if he rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred a higher share, accepting this offer guarantees me a substantial sum and prevents further inflation from eroding my potential gains."
