Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor. I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm also aware of the inflation risk and want to secure a large portion early on.  Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, the inflation risk is real, and a 50/50 split is a fair deal. Accepting now guarantees me a decent amount of money.  There's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the next round."
