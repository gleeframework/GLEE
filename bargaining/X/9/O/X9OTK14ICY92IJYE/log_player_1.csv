{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the money and Bob gets 40%. I think this is a good starting point, and I hope Bob will accept!"

# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 30-70 split, but I'll consider it.
