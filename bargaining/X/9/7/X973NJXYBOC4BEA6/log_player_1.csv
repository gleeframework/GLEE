"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60-40""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the $10,000, which is $6,000, and Bob gets 40%, which is $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but still fair 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob taking a larger share, but I'll consider it. Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

After some thought, I decide to:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a bit aggressive, I'll try to make a more balanced proposal this time. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""A more balanced split, considering the inflation""}

I'm proposing that I get 52% of the $10,000, which is $5,200, and Bob gets 48%, which is $4,800."
