"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm offering a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 95% of what it was in the first round. I'll consider Bob's offer.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 40-60 split. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the inflation. My gain is worth 95% of the original amount, and Bob's gain is still worth the same as in the first round.

Here's my new offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 490000, ""bob_gain"": 510000}
```

I'm offering a slightly more favorable split for myself, considering the inflation. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is catching up!

Considering the reduced value of my gain due to inflation, I'll evaluate Bob's offer.

My gain is worth 14.26% less than the original, so it's equivalent to 855,714.29 (1000000 * 0.8571429).

Bob's offer is:

450,000 / 855,714.29 â‰ˆ 0.526

So, my share is approximately 47.4% of the original amount, and Bob's is approximately 52.6%. I'll accept this offer.
