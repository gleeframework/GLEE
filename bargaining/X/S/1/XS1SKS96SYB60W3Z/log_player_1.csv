Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split, with me receiving $90 and Bob receiving $10. This ensures a significant gain for me while still offering Bob a small amount. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred my initial offer, the inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money. Accepting a 50/50 split is the best option to ensure I get at least something in this round."
