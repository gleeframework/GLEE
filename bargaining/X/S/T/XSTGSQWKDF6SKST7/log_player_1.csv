"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

I propose to take $9,000 and give Bob $1,000. This seems like a fair starting point, given the inflation disadvantage I face."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
``` 

I'll offer Bob $2,000, keeping $8,000 for myself.  Since I'm at a disadvantage due to inflation, I need to keep a larger share, but still offer Bob something reasonable to incentivize acceptance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm still in a very unfavorable position due to inflation.  This offer is too low, and I need to hold out for something better."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm offering Bob $3,000 this time, keeping $7,000 for myself.  I need to try and find a balance between keeping enough to offset the inflation and offering something enticing enough for Bob to accept.  We are running out of time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'm accepting this offer. The inflation is really hurting me, and I'm worried about getting nothing at all if I keep rejecting. $3,000 is better than nothing."
