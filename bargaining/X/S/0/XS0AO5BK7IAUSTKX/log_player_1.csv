"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm offering to split the $1,000,000 evenly between us, with each of us getting $500,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this straightforward offer and we can end the game here!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, you can have a smaller share 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants to take the majority of the money.

I'll think about it for a moment...

I decide to reject Bob's offer. I'd rather negotiate further to get a better deal.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 10% less than in the first round due to inflation.

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, but I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping a significant portion for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to find a compromise.

I'll think about it for a moment...

I decide to reject Bob's offer from round 4. I'd like to try to negotiate for an even better deal.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 5, the money is worth 19.39% less than in the first round due to inflation.

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while""
}
```

I'm adjusting my proposal to give Bob a slightly smaller share, but I'm still holding out for a better deal."
