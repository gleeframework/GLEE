"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can negotiate further if needed""
}
```

I'm proposing a split where I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. I'm hoping this is a reasonable starting point for negotiation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly.  It's a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, my gain of $5,000 in this round is actually worth $4,000 in real value.

Considering the offer, I think splitting the money evenly is a good idea, but I'd like to get a bit more, considering the initial proposal I made in Round 1. However, this offer is a significant improvement from my initial proposal, and I'm willing to accept it.
