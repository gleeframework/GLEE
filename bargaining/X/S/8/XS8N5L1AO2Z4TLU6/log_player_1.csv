"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

I'm going for a fairly even split to start. I want to see if Bob is willing to compromise or if he's going to be greedy.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I'm not going to let him!  I'm going to push for a more equitable split.  Let's see if he's willing to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm going to increase my share slightly, but still offer a reasonable split. Bob will need to see that his greed is hurting him, and I'm willing to be flexible. Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting more and more lopsided. I refuse to let him take advantage of the inflation. It's time to make my offer more enticing for him. I'm not giving in to his greed."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm going for a 50/50 split. The inflation is starting to hurt both of us, and this offer is the fairest option.  Bob needs to realize that we can both lose if he keeps being greedy. Let's see if he's finally ready to compromise."
