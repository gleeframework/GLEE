"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

This way, we both get an equal share of the $100, which is fair and simple."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money, I'm not as eager to give up as much as I was in the first round.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","In Round 3, I'll try to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth even less due to inflation. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.
