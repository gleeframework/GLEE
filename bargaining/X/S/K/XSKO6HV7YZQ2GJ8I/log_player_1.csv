"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll take 60, a fair split for a good friend""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40 dollars, which is a relatively generous split, considering I'm getting the majority of the money. The message is a friendly one, hoping to set a positive tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 55/45 is a more balanced split.  Let's be fair, but also consider the potential for inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, the actual amounts I'll receive are:

* Alice gain: 45 * 0.9 = 40.5
* Bob gain: 55 * 0.9 = 49.5

I'm not thrilled about the split, but I'll consider it. I'll reject this offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you in the middle, let's make a deal""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 45 dollars, which is a slightly better split for me, but I'm still willing to compromise and meet him in the middle."
