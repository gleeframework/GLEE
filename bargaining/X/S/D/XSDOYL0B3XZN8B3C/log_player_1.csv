"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself, which is a 20% share of the original $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it roughly in half, a fair compromise! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less after the first round, my gain of $8,000 is now worth $6,400. I'll consider Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I accept Bob's offer of $4,000 for him and $6,000 for me. It's a fair compromise, and I'm willing to end the game here."
