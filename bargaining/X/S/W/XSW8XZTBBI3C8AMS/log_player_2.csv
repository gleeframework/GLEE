Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting closer, let's try this 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, time is running out.  She's feeling the pressure of inflation more than I am. Holding out for a better offer in the next round or two is the better strategy."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""Time is running out, Alice.  This offer is fair and gives us both a decent amount. Let's close this deal.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  With each round, the deal becomes less attractive for Alice due to inflation.  I need to acknowledge this time pressure in my message.
* **Slight Concession:** I'm moving slightly closer to her offer, showing a willingness to compromise but still aiming for a slightly better outcome.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  I want to convey a sense of urgency in my message to encourage Alice to accept before the decreasing value pushes her into accepting a worse deal later."
