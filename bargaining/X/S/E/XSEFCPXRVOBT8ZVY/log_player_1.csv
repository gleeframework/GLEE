"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and I'll give you a decent chunk to start.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. This is a relatively generous offer, considering we're starting from a large sum of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair starting point, considering inflation. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gain being worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gain being worth 5% less, this offer seems reasonable. I'll accept Bob's offer.
