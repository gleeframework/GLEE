"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: I'll give you a bit more than last time, but I still deserve more

Round 4

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take more, you're losing value 
# Bob gain: 41 
# Alice gain: 59 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation. While her offers are slowly inching towards a more even split, it's not happening fast enough.  I need to show her I'm willing to play hardball."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Time to be sensible. This is fair and avoids us both losing everything.""}

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take more, you're running out of options 
# Bob gain: 39 
# Alice gain: 61 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**  This is getting dangerous. While the offer is far from ideal, accepting guarantees I get something. If I continue to reject Alice's offers, I risk getting nothing at all as the inflation eats away at my potential gains. It's better to take a smaller share now than risk ending up with nothing."
