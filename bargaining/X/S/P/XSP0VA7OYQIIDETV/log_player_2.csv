Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: I'll meet you halfway between our previous offers 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Time is running out, and the value is decreasing. This is a reasonable compromise.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take a smaller share, but still more than you offered 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is slowly coming down, it's still early in the game.  She's feeling the pressure of inflation more than I am.  Holding out a bit longer could lead to a much better deal in a later round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly and end this. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both benefit.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

After rejecting Alice's offer in round 5, it's time to show I'm serious about getting a reasonable deal. Offering a 50/50 split is a strong signal that I'm seeking a fair outcome. It avoids being too aggressive while still being advantageous compared to Alice's decreasing gains."
