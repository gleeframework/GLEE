"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate!""
}
```

This way, we both get $50, and we can both walk away happy. What do you think, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take the majority! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants to take the majority, huh?

I'll have to think carefully about this one...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd rather not give up $20, considering the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round. I'll try to negotiate further!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll try to make a more balanced offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's find a fair split!""
}
```

This way, I'm giving up a bit less than before, but still trying to get a slightly better deal. What do you think, Bob?"
