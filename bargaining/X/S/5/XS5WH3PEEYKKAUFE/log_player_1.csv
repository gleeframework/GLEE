"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm proposing to take $900,000 and leave Bob with $100,000. This is a good starting point to see if Bob will accept, or if he'll counter-propose. I'm aiming for a larger share, knowing the money will be worth less in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse for me than my initial proposal. Even though the money is worth less due to inflation, I'm still better off rejecting his offer and going to the next round.  I have a chance to make a counter-proposal and potentially secure a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
``` 

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself. This is a compromise from my previous offer, but I'm still trying to secure a larger share.  With inflation, the money is worth less now for both of us, so I need to find a balance between getting a good deal and ensuring Bob doesn't feel too unfairly treated."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to a 50/50 split, it's still not favorable to me considering the significant inflation. I'm still better off holding out for a better deal.  I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm proposing to take $600,000 and give Bob $400,000.  With inflation, the money is worth significantly less for both of us, but I'm aiming to secure a larger portion while still making it somewhat attractive to Bob.  Hopefully, this will be enough to finally reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money, Bob's offer is finally getting closer to what I'd like. It's still not ideal, but it's a better deal than I can realistically expect in the next round.  I'm accepting it to avoid the risk of further inflation and a potential worse outcome."
