"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a small amount to get us going.""
}
```

I'm offering you $20 and keeping $80 for myself. Let's see if you'll accept or reject my proposal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm still trying to conserve some for myself. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 10% less than in the previous round, so the actual value of my gain is $72.

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to negotiate further, your offer is still a bit too low for me.""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with the offer, so I'll reject it and it's my turn to make a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, the money is worth even less now. Since my gain is worth 10% less than in the previous round, the actual value of my gain is now $64.40 (80 * 0.9 * 0.9).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 64,
  ""bob_gain"": 36,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to find a middle ground, let's see if this is more to your liking.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not willing to give up too much yet. 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value. My gain is now worth 27.1% less than in the first round, so the actual value of my gain is $57.60 (80 * 0.7273).

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to get closer to an equal split, your offer is still a bit too skewed towards you.""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with the offer, so I'll reject it and it's my turn to make a new proposal."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the continued inflation, my gain is worth even less now. Since my gain is worth 27.1% less than in the previous round, the actual value of my gain is now $41.69 (57.60 * 0.7273 * 0.9).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's try to meet in the middle, an equal split seems fair to me.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable compromise."
