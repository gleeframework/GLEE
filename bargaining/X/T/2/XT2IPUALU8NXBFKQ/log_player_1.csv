"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is a generous offer, giving Bob a 40% share of the initial $1,000,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less for me now, I'll need to adjust my thinking accordingly.

In this offer, Bob is proposing a 50-50 split, which is a bit more aggressive than my initial offer. Considering the inflation, I think I can do better than this.

I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the money being worth 10% less than in the first round for Bob, and 5% less for me, I'll make a new offer.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share this time, but still a generous 45% of the remaining $1,000,000."
