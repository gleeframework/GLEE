"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your starting offer was a bit too greedy for me. Let's be reasonable - I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor.  It's still advantageous for you to accept now, as the pot will shrink in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
