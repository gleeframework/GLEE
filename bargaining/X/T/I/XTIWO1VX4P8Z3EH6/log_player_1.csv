"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the initial $100, and Bob gets 40%. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55-45 split is fairer, considering the inflation we need to keep in mind. Let's see what you think! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting the value of the money, I need to be more cautious. Considering the 5% decrease in the value of the money I gain, I'd rather aim for a higher percentage to compensate for the loss.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a bit low for me, considering the inflation. I'd like to make a counteroffer.""
}
```

I'm not accepting Bob's offer, and I'm preparing to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the 5% decrease in the value of the money I gain, I'll aim for a higher percentage to compensate for the loss. Since Bob's offer was 55-45, I'll try to get closer to 50-50.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 52,
  ""bob_gain"": 48,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think 52-48 is a fairer split considering the inflation. Your turn again!""
}
```

This way, I'm getting a slightly higher percentage, but still leaving room for negotiation."
