"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, 60/40, and we can adjust in future rounds""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 25 
# Bob gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of 25 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain of 75 is worth 90% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not thrilled about the 25/75 split, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 25/75, I'll try to counter with a slightly more favorable split for myself. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not giving up too much""
}
```

Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share this time, but I'm still willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of 20 is worth 85.74% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain of 80 is worth 72.9% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not thrilled about the 20/80 split, but I'm getting a bit desperate. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
