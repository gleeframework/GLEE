"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40 to get started. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split to give Bob a decent chunk of the money, while keeping a majority for myself. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but still a good chunk for myself 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking its toll!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully. While it's a good deal for me, it's still a relatively small share of the total amount. However, it's better than nothing, and I don't want to risk going into the next round with a smaller amount due to inflation.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now.
