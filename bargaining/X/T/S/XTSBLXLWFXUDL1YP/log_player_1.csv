"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""A fair and reasonable split""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets 40%, which is $40. I think this is a fair and reasonable split, considering we're starting with a clean slate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slightly more generous offer from me 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 20% decrease in value, but I'll consider Bob's new offer.

Since Bob is offering me 70% of the current value, which is $70, and he's keeping 30% for himself, which is $30, I'll decide to...

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Let's try to negotiate again!

{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20, ""message"": ""A slightly more aggressive offer from me""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the current value, which is $80, and Bob gets 20%, which is $20. I'm being a bit more aggressive this time, hoping to get a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slightly more aggressive offer from me 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly!

Considering the new offer, I'll think about it...

Bob is offering me 75% of the current value, which is $75, and he's keeping 25% for himself, which is $25. Since the value of the money is decreasing rapidly, I think this might be a good opportunity to accept a deal before things get worse.

I'll decide to...
