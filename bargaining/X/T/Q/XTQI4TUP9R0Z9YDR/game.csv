5200.0,4800.0,"Bob, I understand you want to split evenly, but time is working against us, especially you. This offer is a good compromise â€“  it's closer to your ideal split than my last one, and we both lose less to inflation by settling now.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"I'm sticking with my previous offer. Even with inflation, a 50/50 split is the fairest outcome for both of us.  Let's not risk losing more money by delaying further.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5100.0,4900.0,"Bob, I appreciate your insistence on fairness, but inflation makes a 50/50 split increasingly unreasonable.  This offer is a very small concession on my part, and secures you a decent amount before it shrinks further.",Alice,5,

5000.0,5000.0,"Alice, we're both losing money with each passing round.  A 50/50 split is still the most fair and sensible solution.  Let's not keep pushing our luck with inflation.",Bob,6,

5050.0,4950.0,"Bob, I'm trying to meet you halfway, but you're clinging to an ideal that's becoming less realistic with each round.  This is a very slight advantage for me, and it avoids significant losses for both of us. Let's be pragmatic.",Alice,7,

5000.0,5000.0,"Alice, we're in a lose-lose situation if we don't agree.  Let's finally split the money evenly and stop risking further losses to inflation.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
5025.0,4975.0,"Bob, we're running out of time!  I'm conceding as much as I can here. A 50/50 split is no longer fair due to inflation, but this offer ensures you get almost half.  Let's be reasonable and end this before we both get nothing.",Alice,9,
