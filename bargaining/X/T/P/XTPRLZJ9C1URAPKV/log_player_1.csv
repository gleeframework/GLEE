"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

This means I'm offering to take 70% of the $100, and Bob would get 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's new offer. Since the money is worth 10% less for Bob, the actual amounts he's offering are:

Alice gain: 60
Bob gain: 36

I'll accept this offer.
