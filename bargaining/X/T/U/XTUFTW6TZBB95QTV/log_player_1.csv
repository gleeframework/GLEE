"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 40% of the total.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $10,000, which is $4,000, and keeping 60% for myself, which is $6,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a 50/50 split, but I think I deserve a bit more since I'm the one making the offer 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, $5,000 is equivalent to $4,500 in the first round. And since the money is worth 20% less for Bob, $5,000 is equivalent to $4,000 in the first round.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, as it's still a 50/50 split, but considering the inflation, I'm actually getting less than I initially proposed. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth 20% less than in the second round for Bob, but I don't know how it affects him. I'll make a new offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve more for taking the risk of rejecting your previous offer.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give in too much, since you rejected my previous offer 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the equivalent values in the first round:

My gain of $5,200 in the fourth round is equivalent to $4,330.80 in the first round, considering the 27.1% reduction due to inflation.
Bob's gain of $4,800 in the fourth round is equivalent to $3,115.20 in the first round, considering the 48.8% reduction due to inflation.

Considering the inflation, Bob's offer is actually a better deal for me than my initial offer in round 1. However, I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, as I rejected Bob's previous offer and I'm not sure if he'll make a better one.

I'll accept this offer.
