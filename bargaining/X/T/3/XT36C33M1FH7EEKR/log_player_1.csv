Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm proposing to keep the vast majority of the money ($999,000) for myself, giving Bob a small share of $1,000.  This is a risky move, as Bob could easily reject this offer and get a chance to propose in the next round. However, it establishes a strong starting position and sets the stage for negotiation.  Let's see what Bob does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd love to keep a larger share, the risk of getting nothing after 12 rounds is too high. Accepting a 50/50 split is a fair outcome, given the potential for both of us to end up with nothing."
