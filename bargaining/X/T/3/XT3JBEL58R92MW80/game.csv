60.0,40.0,Let's split the money 60/40.  I think this is a fair offer that allows us both to benefit.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,Your offer was a bit too greedy. Let's be reasonable - how about a 55/45 split in my favor? We can both walk away with something.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"Bob, I understand you want a larger share, but your previous offer wasn't fair considering the time pressure. Let's meet in the middle with a 55/45 split in my favor. This way we both benefit significantly more than waiting any longer.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
50.0,50.0,"Alice, let's stop wasting time. We're getting nowhere fast. A 50/50 split is the fairest option. Take it or leave it.",Bob,4,
