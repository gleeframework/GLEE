"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can move on!""
}
```

This way, I get 80% of the original 100$, and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fair. Let's avoid any further haggling! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll have to re-evaluate the offer.

In this round, the money is worth 20% less, so my gain of 40$ is actually worth 32$ (40 * 0.8), and Bob's gain of 60$ is worth 57.6$ (60 * 0.96).

I'm not sure if I'm ready to accept a 32$ gain, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the reduced value of money, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll aim to get a higher share to compensate for the decrease in value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation.""
}
```

In this round, my gain of 45$ is worth 36$ (45 * 0.8), and Bob's gain of 55$ is worth 52.8$ (55 * 0.96)."
