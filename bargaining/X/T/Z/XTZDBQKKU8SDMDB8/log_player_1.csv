"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 80% and you can have 20%. We can re-negotiate if you don't like it.""
}
```

This way, I'll get $8,000 and Bob will get $2,000. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60-40 is a more reasonable split. You can have 40% and I'll take 60. Let's see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting already!

Considering the new offer from Bob, I'll think for a moment... 

I'd rather not accept the 40% share. I'll try to negotiate for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is getting worse!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll aim for a slightly higher share. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. I'll take 55% and you can have 45%. Let's see if this is more to your liking.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to a compromise. How about we split it 50-50? It's fair and we can both walk away with the same amount. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll!

Considering the 50-50 split, I think it's a reasonable offer, especially since the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. I'd rather not risk going into further rounds and potentially getting a worse deal.
