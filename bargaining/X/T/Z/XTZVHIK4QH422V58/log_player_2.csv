Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  While not ideal, this is the best offer I'm likely to get at this point. The deal is getting worse for Alice with every round, but we are running out of time and I don't want to risk getting nothing.  It's better to secure something now than hold out for an extra dollar and lose everything."
