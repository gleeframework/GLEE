"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, seems fair!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself, with a message suggesting a 60-40 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not being generous 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less in the second round, I'll consider the actual amounts as follows:

Alice's gain: $3000 / 0.9 = $3333.33 (due to 10% inflation)
Bob's gain: $7000 / 0.9 = $7777.78

I'll reject this offer since I can do better than a 75-25 split. 

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the second round, I'll consider the actual amount as follows:

$10,000 / 0.9 = $11,111.11 (due to 10% inflation)

I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, 55-45 split!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,500 and keeping $5,500 for myself, with a message suggesting a 55-45 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a 50-50 split, no need to negotiate 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'll consider the actual amount as follows:

$10,000 / 0.721 = $13,900.55 (due to 27.1% inflation)

However, I'll consider the actual amounts as follows:

Alice's gain: $5,000 / 0.721 = $6,945.88
Bob's gain: $5,000 / 0.721 = $6,945.88

I'll accept this offer since it's a 50-50 split, which is a fair deal given the circumstances.
