Let's see if I can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 9000, ""alice_gain"": 1000} 
```

I'm starting with a bold move. Hopefully, Alice will realize that it's better to take a small share now than risk getting nothing in later rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice is still trying to take the majority of the money, and the inflation effect is not making a big difference yet. I'm going to keep rejecting until I get a fairer offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 8000, ""alice_gain"": 2000} 
```

I'm raising the stakes again. If Alice keeps rejecting, she's risking getting nothing in later rounds, and the inflation effect is starting to bite."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000

Inflation is starting to hurt Alice more than me. I'm going to keep pushing for a better deal."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000} 
```

I'm getting closer to my goal! Alice is losing more and more with each passing round due to inflation. Hopefully, this offer will be tempting enough for her to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice is getting desperate, but I'm not giving in yet.  The inflation effect is really starting to kick in, and I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000} 
```

I'm sticking with my strategy of gradually increasing my share. Alice is losing value with every round due to inflation, and I think she might be willing to compromise now."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 83.22% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a pretty fair offer. Even though I could potentially get a bit more, I'm not sure how much longer I can keep pushing Alice.  The inflation is hurting her badly, and I don't want to risk getting nothing. Let's take the 50/50 split and call it a day."
