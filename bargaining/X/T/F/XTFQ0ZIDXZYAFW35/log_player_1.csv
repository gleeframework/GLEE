"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take 90% and you can take 10%.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 90% of the initial $1,000,000, leaving Bob with $100,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be a bit more fair, Alice. I'll take 55% and you can take 45%.  This way, we both get a good share. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the money is worth 5% less, so the actual amounts I'll gain are:

Alice gain: 450,000 x 0.95 = 427,500
Bob gain: 550,000 x 0.95 = 522,500

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a good opportunity to get a decent share of the money. I'll accept his offer.
