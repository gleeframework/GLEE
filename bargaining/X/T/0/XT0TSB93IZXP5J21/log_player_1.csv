Bob's offer:

This is a tricky situation, but it's better to accept Bob's offer now. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for you. Waiting longer means you'll get even less.
* **Bob's Stance:** Bob has indicated this is his final offer. There's a good chance he won't budge further, and you'll be forced to accept even less in later rounds. 
* **Certainty:** Accepting now guarantees you get something. Rejecting this offer is risky as there's no guarantee you can secure a better deal later.

While not ideal, getting 60% of a shrinking pot is better than risking getting nothing at all if the game goes on too long."
