"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, and see how the negotiations go!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'm willing to give you a decent chunk. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not willing to give up such a large majority of the money. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slight majority, but I think this is a fair split considering the initial offer was 50/50.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, giving Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping a bit more for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you in the middle, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share for taking the risk of rejection. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to meet me in the middle, but he's still trying to get a slightly larger share. I'm not sure I'm willing to give up that much more. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4900,
  ""bob_gain"": 5100,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not willing to give up more than that. I think this is a fair compromise.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a larger share and keeping some control over the negotiation."
