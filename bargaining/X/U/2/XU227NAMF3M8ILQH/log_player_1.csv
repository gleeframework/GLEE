"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

I'm offering Bob 30 dollars, which is a relatively small amount, so I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is a bit more generous than mine, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering Bob a smaller share this time, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
