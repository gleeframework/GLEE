"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

I propose that Alice gets $9,000 and Bob gets $1,000. This is a fair starting point, giving me a significant share but leaving Bob with something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
 
Bob's offer is fair, and it would be risky to reject it. Inflation means that the money will continue to be worth less with each passing round, and we may end up with nothing."
