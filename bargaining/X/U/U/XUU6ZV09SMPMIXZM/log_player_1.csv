"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, then negotiate from there!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000, leaving Bob with 20%. My message is a friendly opening offer, inviting Bob to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, I think that's fair. No need to complicate things. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money has decreased due to inflation, so my gain of $5000 is now worth 95% of its original value.

I'm not convinced that splitting it evenly is the best option, but I'm willing to consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure splitting it evenly is the best use of our combined negotiating power. Can we discuss further?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, my gain of $5000 from the previous round is now worth 95% of its original value, so it's equivalent to $4750. I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more given the original amount.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm sticking with my previous offer. I think we can both agree that a fair split is best for both of us in the long run. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money has decreased further due to inflation, so my gain of $6000 from the previous round is now worth 85.74% of its original value, which is equivalent to $5147.40. However, I'll consider the new offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not convinced that this is the best split for me, especially considering the value of money is decreasing.""
}
```"
