"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $4000 and take $6000. Let's finish the game here.""
}
```

This offer is a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle, a fair and simple approach. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth 5% less, so my gain of $5000 is actually worth $4750.

I don't think this is a very good offer for me, considering I could have gotten $6000 in the first round. I'd like to make a counteroffer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Your offer is too low. I'd like to propose a new split.""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain of $5000 is worth $4750, and I'd like to make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly higher share, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the initial offer I made. Take it or leave it.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly higher share, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the initial offer I made. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, so my gain of $4800 is actually worth $4133.60.

I think this offer is a bit more reasonable, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'd like to make a counteroffer to try to get an even better deal.

  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure if this is the best I can get. I'd like to propose a new split.""

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain of $4800 is worth $4133.60, and I'd like to make an even more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal.

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise and split it exactly in half again, considering the value of money is decreasing rapidly. Let's end the game here. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth 22.62% less than in the first round, so my gain of $5000 is actually worth $3878.40.

I'm not sure if this is the best I can get, but I'm also not sure if I want to risk going to another round. Considering the rapidly decreasing value of money, I think it's better to accept this offer and get something rather than risking getting less in the next round.

  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, I'll accept the offer. Let's end the game here.""
