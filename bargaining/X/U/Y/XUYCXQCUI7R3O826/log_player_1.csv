"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and it's a good way to get the negotiation started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a small share, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with Bob's offer. I was hoping for a more substantial share, especially considering the inflation effect. I'm willing to negotiate further, but 20% is too low for me. I'll try to make a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Let's try 45-55""}

I'm trying to find a middle ground and compromise with Bob. I'm willing to give him a slightly larger share than my initial offer, but I still think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation effect."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to give up too much, but I'll try to meet you in the middle 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with Bob's offer again. The inflation effect is taking a toll on my share, and I'm not willing to accept 30% of the remaining value. I think I can do better than that. I'll try to make another offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 35, ""bob_gain"": 65, ""message"": ""I'm trying to find a compromise, but I need a bit more. Let's try 35-65""}

I'm trying to find a middle ground again, but this time I'm willing to give Bob a slightly larger share than before. I'm hoping that this offer will be more acceptable to him."
