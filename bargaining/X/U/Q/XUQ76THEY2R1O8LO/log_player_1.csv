"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Take it or leave it?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial $100, which is $20, and keeping 80% for myself, which is $80. The message is a straightforward one - take it or leave it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fairer.  Let's try this. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a toll!

Considering Bob's new offer, I think it's a bit more reasonable than the first one. However, I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Time for my next move!

Considering the inflation, my offer will be adjusted accordingly. Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll aim for a slightly better split.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle. A 50/50 split is a fair compromise.""
}
```"
