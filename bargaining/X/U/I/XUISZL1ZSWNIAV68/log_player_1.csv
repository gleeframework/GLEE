"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, giving me a slightly larger share of the initial $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new inflation rates, my gain of 50$ is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain of 50$ is worth 90% of what it was in the first round.

I accept Bob's offer:

```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
