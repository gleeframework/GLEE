"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll give you a good chunk to get us moving.""
}
```

I'm offering you $2,000, and I'll take the remaining $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm offering you a fair split, considering the inflation that will hit your share harder. Let's be reasonable and get this done. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation taking a bigger hit on my share, I'll have to be more cautious. However, Bob's offer seems reasonable, and I'd rather not risk waiting for another round.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
