"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's get this started! I'll give you a good chunk to get us moving. 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
 
While the offer seems tempting at first, it's important to consider the inflation. In the next round, I can make a proposal and get a better deal since the value of Alice's money will be reduced by 20%. It's worth taking the risk to try and get a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm offering you a fair split, considering the inflation that will hit your share harder. Let's be reasonable and get this done.""}
