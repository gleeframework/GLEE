"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you a decent amount, but I'm not going to give away too much.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a relatively generous offer considering the game is about to start."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too stingy, now it's my turn to be generous... or not. 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take advantage of me in the second round!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, $2500 is equivalent to $2375 in the first round's value. That's a relatively small amount, considering the total amount of $10,000.

I'll decide to reject this offer and hope to do better in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer for Round 3. Considering the inflation, I'll aim to get a higher percentage of the total amount.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You were too generous last round, now it's my turn to take a bigger share. Don't expect me to give you more than this!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting greedy, I'll take a bigger share this time. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take advantage of my greed!

Let's calculate the value of the money I gain in the first round, taking into account the cumulative inflation: 5% in the first round, 5% in the second round, and 5% in the third round, which is a total of 15% less. That means the money I gain in the fourth round is worth 85% of the original amount.

$4500 is equivalent to $4500 in the first round's value, which is a decent amount. However, considering the total amount of $10,000 and the fact that the money I gain is worth 14.26% less due to inflation, I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer.

I'll decide to reject this offer and hope to do better in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer for Round 5. Considering the cumulative inflation, I'll aim to get a higher percentage of the total amount.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6200,
  ""bob_gain"": 3800,
  ""message"": ""You're trying to take advantage of me, but I'm not going to let you. This is my final offer, take it or leave it!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not getting any more generous, I'll take the lead this time. 
# Alice gain: 3800 
# Bob gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take the lead now!

Let's calculate the value of the money I gain in the first round, taking into account the cumulative inflation: 5% in the first round, 5% in the second round, 5% in the third round, and 5% in the fourth round, which is a total of 20% less. Then, in the fifth round, it's 5% more, so the total is 25% less. That means the money I gain in the sixth round is worth 75% of the original amount.

$3800 is equivalent to $3800 in the first round's value, which is a decent amount. Considering the total amount of $10,000 and the fact that the money I gain is worth 22.62% less due to inflation, I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer.

I'll decide to accept this offer, as it's getting late in the game and I don't want to risk losing even more value due to inflation.
