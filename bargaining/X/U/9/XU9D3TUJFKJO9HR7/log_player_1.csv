"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'm willing to give you a good deal.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the original $100, and Bob will get 40%. I'm trying to make a good first impression and set a fair tone for the negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. Let's split it closer to the middle. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is already affecting me!

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not quite comfortable with the new split. I'd like to try to negotiate further to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a counteroffer that's more favorable to me, considering the inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 52,
  ""bob_gain"": 48,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more. Can we meet in the middle?""
}
```

This way, I'm trying to get a slightly larger share, but still keeping the offer somewhat reasonable. Let's see how Bob responds!"
