"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, then we can negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial 100$, which is $20, and keeping 80% for myself, which is $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. This way, we both get a fair share. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation, my gain of $80 from the first round is now worth $64.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to negotiate further, as I think I can do better than a 50-50 split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the 20% inflation, my gain from the previous round is now worth $51.20 ($80 x 0.64).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more after rejecting your previous offer.""
}
```"
