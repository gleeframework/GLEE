"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share, but you get a decent cut. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While a decent cut, it's worth seeing if Alice will budge in the next round with the knowledge of the inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable. We both get a significant amount, and we can avoid the inflation taking a bite out of our potential gains.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger share to make this worthwhile for me. Let's avoid the risk of losing more to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While this offer is better for Bob than the previous round, the inflation is still heavily affecting both players. It's worth pushing for a more balanced split before it impacts us further."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 350000, ""alice_gain"": 650000, ""message"": ""Let's split it more evenly.  We both lose more with each round. This offer is a fair compromise to avoid further losses.""}
