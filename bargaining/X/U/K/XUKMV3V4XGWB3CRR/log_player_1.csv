"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, I'll consider the offer in terms of the actual amount of money I'll get.

If I accept Bob's offer, I'll get 600,000 dollars, which is equivalent to 0.9 * 600,000 = 540,000 dollars in the first round.

I'll accept the offer.
