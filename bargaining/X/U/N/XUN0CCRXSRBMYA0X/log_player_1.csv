Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm taking a greedy approach, aiming for 90% of the money in this first round.  Let's see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my initial proposal. While it's true inflation has devalued the money, I'm still confident I can get a better deal if we continue negotiating.  I'll try to make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
``` 

I'm going to propose a 70/30 split in my favor.  Bob's offer was way too low, and while inflation has devalued the money, I'm still confident I can secure a larger portion."
