# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to make a more even split, but I'm not convinced it's the best deal for me.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is getting desperate, and I'm not sure if I should be too.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. The money is worth significantly less now, and I'm not sure if I can do better in the next round. This seems like a decent compromise, and I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed 55% of the remaining amount."
