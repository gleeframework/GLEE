Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```

  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm offering you $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, the value of the money is decreasing, so I need to be more cautious.
