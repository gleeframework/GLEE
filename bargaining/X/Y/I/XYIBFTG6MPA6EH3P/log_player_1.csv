Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a very lopsided offer, knowing that Bob's money won't depreciate. I'm hoping he'll accept this since he's guaranteed to gain something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, a 50/50 split is a decent outcome considering the inflation.  There's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in the next round, and the money will be worth less."
