Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is slowly moving towards a more even split, the deal is still not favorable given the inflation working against me.  I need to signal I'm willing to walk away if I don't get a larger share soon."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""This is my final offer.  A 50/50 split is the only fair option now.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is steadily eating into my potential gains. While I'd prefer a slightly larger share, a 50/50 split is the most logical choice at this point. This offer conveys seriousness and a willingness to walk away if Alice continues to push for a larger share."
