"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than a 60/40 split. I'm offering you 4500, which is still more than a fair split, considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with the 45-55 split. I'd like to try to get a bit more. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you in the middle. 50/50 split. Let's end this!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, with us both getting $5,000."
