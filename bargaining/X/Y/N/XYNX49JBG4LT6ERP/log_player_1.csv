Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share to start, hoping to negotiate a better deal later on."

# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gain, I'm now looking for a better deal. Bob's offer is a significant increase in my share, but I'm still not convinced it's the best I can get.

I'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round.
