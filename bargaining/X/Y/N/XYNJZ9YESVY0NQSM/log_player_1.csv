"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

This is a fair and equal split, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it quickly so we can end the game and avoid the inflation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but the money Bob gains is worth 5% less, I'll have to decide whether the slight difference is worth it.

I'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 10% less now (5% less than the first round, and another 5% less from the second round), I'll make a slightly more aggressive offer to compensate for the inflation.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gain still worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain being worth significantly less due to the accumulating inflation, I'll consider this offer carefully.

Since my gain is still 60% of the original amount, and Bob's gain is 52% of the original amount, I think this offer is a good compromise. I'll accept it.
