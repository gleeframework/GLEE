"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing to split the $10,000 evenly, with each of us getting $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's only fair that I get a slightly larger share, considering the money is worth less to you each round.  Let's make this happen! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's proposal, but I'll consider it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I think 40% of the total amount is a bit too much for Bob to get, especially considering the inflation factor. I'd like to make a counteroffer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55% is a bit too much. Let's meet in the middle!""}

I'm proposing a slightly more skewed split, with me getting 45% and Bob getting 55%. I'm hoping this compromise will be more acceptable to Bob."
