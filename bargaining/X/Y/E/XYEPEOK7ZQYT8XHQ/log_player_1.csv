"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose a 900,000/100,000 split.  It's fair, and I believe it's in our best interest to reach an agreement quickly before the inflation kicks in."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I'm proposing a 850,000/150,000 split.  Since Bob rejected my initial offer, I'm willing to give him a slightly larger share to avoid further inflation."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While I'm losing a lot of value due to inflation, I can't accept such an unequal split. I need to keep negotiating to get a fairer deal."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm offering a 700,000/300,000 split. While I'm taking a bigger hit from inflation, I believe this is a fair offer that reflects the declining value of the money and gives Bob a chance to get a larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20000 
# Bob gain: 980000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still losing too much due to inflation and Bob is being incredibly greedy.  This is not a fair offer.  I need to keep negotiating."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering a 600,000/400,000 split. We both have lost significant value from inflation, and we need to find a compromise. I believe this offer is fair and gives Bob a chance to get a larger share without making me lose even more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I cannot accept this offer. It's clear Bob is prioritizing his gains over any form of fairness. I'm not willing to lose so much money just for him to take advantage of the situation. We'll keep negotiating."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm proposing a 500,000/500,000 split.  This is a true 50/50 split to reflect the substantial losses we've both suffered from inflation.  It's time to end this negotiation and agree on a fair division."
