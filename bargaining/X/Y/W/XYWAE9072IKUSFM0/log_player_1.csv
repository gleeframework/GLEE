"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start""}

I'm proposing that we divide the $10,000 equally, with each of us getting $5,000. This seems like a fair starting point, and it's a good way to get the game underway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, you can have a small share 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't like Bob's offer. He's trying to take the majority of the money, leaving me with a very small share. I think I can do better than that.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but you'll still get a decent chunk""}

I'm proposing that I take a slightly larger share, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount of money. I'm hoping this offer is more appealing to him than the previous one."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting greedy, I'll give you a slightly smaller share this time 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'm starting to run out of options. I'll have to consider it carefully.
