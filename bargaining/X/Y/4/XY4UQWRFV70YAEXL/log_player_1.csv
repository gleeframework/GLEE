Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fairer, considering we both need to agree on a division. Let's work together to make this work! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
