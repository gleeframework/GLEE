"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm offering to split the $10,000 evenly, with each of us getting $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully...

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not too concerned about the inflation. However, I'm not thrilled about the uneven split. I was hoping for a more balanced division.

I'll decide to reject this offer and proceed to the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I'm trying to find a more balanced split, with a slightly higher gain for myself to make up for the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

Considering the inflation has taken a bigger hit on Bob's end, I'm willing to compromise and accept this offer. The split is still not even, but it's closer than before.
