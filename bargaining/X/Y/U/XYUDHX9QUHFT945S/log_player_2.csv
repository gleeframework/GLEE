"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair split. You get 10% and I get 90%. Let's start this game off strong! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This offer is far from fair.  While 100,000 is a nice chunk of change, I'm not going to settle for such a lopsided deal. Let's see what Alice will offer in the next round.  I'm hoping for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
