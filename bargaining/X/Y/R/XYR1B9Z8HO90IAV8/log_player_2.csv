"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'm feeling generous, take it or leave it.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  The money loses value for me rapidly with each round. It's important to secure a good amount sooner rather than later.
* **Fairness and Incentive:** Offering slightly more than half shows Alice I'm serious about getting a deal done, but also that I understand the value of time in this game. My offer is significantly better than what she proposed in Round 1, giving her an incentive to accept.
* **Negotiation Tactic:** The message ""I'm feeling generous, take it or leave it"" is designed to create a sense of urgency and finality, potentially pushing Alice towards acceptance."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You should've taken the first offer 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Deteriorating Position:** While my position is worse due to inflation, accepting this offer would be a significant loss compared to what I could have gained in Round 1. Alice is clearly trying to exploit the time pressure.
* **Holding Onto Hope:** There's still a chance Alice might become more reasonable in the next round. If she continues to lowball me, I'll be forced to accept a less favorable deal eventually, but I'm not there yet. 
* **No Agreement is Worse for Her:** Alice gains nothing if we don't reach an agreement. She might be trying to intimidate me, but she also has an incentive to make a deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Let's be realistic. This is my final offer.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency:** The value of the money is rapidly decreasing for me. I need to secure a deal now.
* **Concession:** I'm willing to accept a slightly less favorable split than my initial offer, acknowledging the time pressure I'm under.
* **Finality:** The message ""Let's be realistic. This is my final offer"" clearly communicates that I'm serious about ending the negotiation in this round.  
* **Strategic Retreat:** By offering slightly less than Alice's original offer, I create a sense of urgency and make her reconsider the potential losses if we don't reach an agreement.

I believe this offer represents a balance between maximizing my potential gain and minimizing the risk of further losses due to inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Up:** The value of the money has significantly eroded.  Waiting any longer will result in an even worse deal for me. 
* **Minimal Gains:** While this offer is much lower than I hoped for, it's still better than what I would get if I reject it and we fail to reach an agreement. At this point, anything I could realistically get Alice to agree to in Round 6 would be marginally better than this, if at all.
* **Avoiding Total Loss:**  By accepting, I at least secure something, whereas continuing the game risks getting nothing at all. 

Alice has played hardball and taken advantage of my time-sensitive position. It's unfortunate, but accepting this offer is the most logical choice in this situation."
