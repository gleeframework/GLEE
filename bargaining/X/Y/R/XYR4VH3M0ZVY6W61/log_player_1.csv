"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 70% of the initial $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair. Let's see what you think. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, my gain of $400,000 is now worth 80% of $400,000, which is $320,000.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 40% share, especially with the money losing value due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and split the remaining money 50/50. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split, hoping to balance out the loss in value due to inflation."
