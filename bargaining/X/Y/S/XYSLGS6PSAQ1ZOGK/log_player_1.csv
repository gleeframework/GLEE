"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split, considering the inflation we both face. Let's end this round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer seems fairer at first glance considering the inflation, it's actually heavily skewed in his favor over time.  I need to push for a better split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, your offer heavily favors you in the long run due to inflation. This split is more balanced considering the decreasing value over time.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This offer accounts for inflation and allows for a more balanced split. Let's finish this round and be done with it. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, Bob's offer is now reasonably close to a fair split considering the inflation. Rejecting it and going to another round risks a worse outcome for me. The longer the game goes on, the more the inflation will disproportionately affect me. It's better to accept a slightly less favorable deal now than risk getting a much worse deal later."
