"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take the majority and you can have the rest.""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll match your fairness, but I'd like to have a slightly larger share for my efforts. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think it's fair that Bob gets the same amount as me, considering I made the first offer. I was willing to give him 20% of the initial amount, and now he's proposing a 50-50 split. I'd like to make a new offer that takes into account the inflation and still gives me a slight advantage."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think it's still a fair compromise considering the inflation.""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the remaining $1,000,000 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I'm being generous here, considering the inflation. You should accept this offer! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not impressed with Bob's offer. He's trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a larger share, but I think it's still not fair. I was willing to give him 40% of the initial amount, and now he's proposing a 70-30 split. I'd like to make another offer that takes into account the inflation and still gives me a decent share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I still think I deserve a bigger cut considering my initial offer.""}

I'm proposing that I get 45% of the remaining $1,000,000 and Bob gets 55%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm making a bold move, taking most of the remaining money. You should accept this offer before it's too late! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not going to accept an offer that gives me such a small share of the remaining money. Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to get most of the remaining amount, but I'm not going to let him get away with it. I'd like to make another offer that takes into account the inflation and still gives me a decent share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 250000, ""bob_gain"": 750000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I still think I deserve some recognition for my initial offer.""}

I'm proposing that I get 25% of the remaining $1,000,000 and Bob gets 75%."
