"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I get a bit more now to account for the faster inflation affecting my share. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject this offer. While I understand Alice's point about inflation, I think the 60/40 split is too lopsided in her favor. I'm willing to negotiate, but I want a fairer share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, Alice.  We both lose money with each round, so I think it's best to find a quick agreement.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my offer is still on the table.  It's important to acknowledge the impact of inflation on our shares. This split reflects that. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still going to reject the offer. While I understand the impact of inflation, I'm not comfortable with such a large difference in our shares.  Let's find a more equitable solution."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""Alice, let's compromise.  I'm willing to go up to 45, but we need to come to an agreement quickly before inflation eats away at both our shares.""} 
```"
