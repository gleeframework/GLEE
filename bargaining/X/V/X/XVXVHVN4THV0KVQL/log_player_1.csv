"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is a relatively small amount, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm still trying to get a good deal 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

After considering Bob's offer, I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better. With inflation reducing the value of the money, I want to aim for a higher amount to maintain my purchasing power. I'll try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The game continues!

Considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer, I'll make a new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is a slightly better split for him, but I'm still trying to maintain a decent amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to a fair deal, but I'm still not there yet 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","The game is heating up!

Considering Bob's offer and the increasing inflation, I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because, although it's a slightly better split for me than my previous offer, I still think I can do better. The inflation is eating away at the value of the money, so I need to aim for a higher amount to maintain my purchasing power. I'll try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The game continues!

Considering the increasing inflation and the previous offers, I'll make a new proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob an equal split, which is a fair deal considering the inflation and the previous offers. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can finally end the game."
