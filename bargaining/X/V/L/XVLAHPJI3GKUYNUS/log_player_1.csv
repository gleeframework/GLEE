"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives me 90% of the money and Bob only 10%.  This is a large initial difference, but I figure I can start with a strong offer and see if he accepts.  If not, I'll adjust my offer in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is a complete reversal of my initial offer. While I understand the influence of inflation on his gains, this is an unacceptable offer for me.  I will continue to negotiate for a fairer split in the following rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm reducing my share slightly to 80% and increasing Bob's to 20%. I'm hoping this shows that I'm willing to compromise, but still trying to secure a good deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still offering a very uneven split, even with the significant inflation on his gains.  I am not willing to accept such a low share of the money, and will continue to negotiate for a better deal in the upcoming rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm further reducing my share, hoping to show flexibility and find a compromise point. However, I still need a significant portion of the money, as the rounds are passing quickly, and the inflation on Bob's side is becoming more pronounced."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Although Bob's offer is slightly more appealing than previous ones due to the significant inflation on his side, it is still far from a fair split. I am not willing to accept such a low share of the money, and will continue negotiating for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I am continuing to lower my share, but with a more significant reduction this time. I believe this signals a greater willingness to compromise, and also acknowledges the increasing pressure of the passing rounds and the inflation on Bob's side. I'm hoping this leads to a more fruitful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to a more even split due to the inflation on his side, it's still not a good deal for me. I'm not willing to accept such a low share with so few rounds remaining. I'll continue to negotiate for a more equitable distribution in the next rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

With only a few rounds left, I'm proposing a 50/50 split.  The inflation is now heavily impacting Bob's gains, and I believe this is a fair solution to ensure we both receive a reasonable share of the money."
