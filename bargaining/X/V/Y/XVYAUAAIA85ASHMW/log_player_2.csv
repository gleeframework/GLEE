Let's see what I can get!"

I'll propose a more even split, hoping Alice will accept this time.  Let's see if we can find a win-win!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Alice is being stubborn!  I'll make another offer in the next round."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I'm going to try and get closer to my desired split.  I'll keep the money split close to 55/45, since that seems to be the sticking point, and hopefully Alice will finally accept."
