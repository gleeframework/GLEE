"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, I get a bit more 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer sounds tempting, it significantly favors her. The inflation works in my favor as Bob. It's better to wait for a more balanced offer or propose one in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""This offer accounts for the inflation and gives us both a good deal. Let's close the deal.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Advantage:** The longer Alice waits, the less valuable the money becomes for her due to the higher inflation rate she faces (10% vs. my 5%). 
* **Early Agreement Incentive:** Offering a slightly better deal than her initial proposal might entice her to accept now, avoiding the risk of further devaluation and securing a reasonable sum for both of us.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By making a reasonable offer early on, I demonstrate a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a favorable outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, I made a small concession, let's settle 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** Alice's ""concession"" is minimal and still heavily favors her.  The inflation is working in my favor more significantly with each round. It's strategically advantageous to wait for a more balanced offer, especially as we're only on round 3."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 475000, ""alice_gain"": 525000, ""message"": ""Time is running out, and the money is losing value for both of us. This is a fair split considering the circumstances. Let's be sensible and end this.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increased Urgency:** We are now past the halfway point of the rounds. The pressure of losing everything is mounting, and this should encourage Alice to accept a less favorable deal than she might have considered earlier.
* **Inflation Factor:**  The inflation is working strongly in my favor, and while it also affects me, Alice is losing value at twice the rate. This offer, while generous, highlights the need for a swift resolution in the face of diminishing returns. 
* **Appearance of Compromise:** By increasing my initial offer, I signal a willingness to negotiate and compromise, which might make Alice more receptive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is hurting me more, I'll take a bit less, but let's end this soon 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** While Alice acknowledges the impact of inflation, her offer is still not favorable enough. A difference of 140,000 is significant, even with the devaluation. It's a waiting game now, and my position is continually strengthening as the rounds progress. Alice will likely be forced to make a much better offer soon."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's end this right now with a perfectly equal split. It's the fairest option considering the time pressure and makes sure we both benefit.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Even Split:** Offering a 50/50 split at this stage might seem overly generous, but it's a calculated move. It presents an offer Alice is unlikely to refuse given the circumstances. 
* **Time Pressure:**  We are approaching the final rounds, and the risk of walking away with nothing is very real for both of us.  
* **Fairness Appeal:** By proposing an even split, I remove any sense of unfairness or advantage-taking. It's a clean and justifiable resolution that benefits us both equally."
