"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair and square, let's start with a balanced split!""}

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40. I think this is a fair starting point, and it's a good balance between our potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have a smaller share, but I'll give you a chance to get something! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the reduced offer, but I'm willing to consider it. Since the money is worth 20% less, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting this offer because I was hoping for a better split. I'm willing to negotiate further and try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 30 for me and 70 for him, I'm going to try to improve on that. I'll offer a slightly better deal, hoping to get Bob to accept.

{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60, ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. Let's try to find a compromise!""}

I'm proposing that I get $40 and Bob gets $60. I'm trying to find a middle ground that might be more appealing to Bob."
