"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's meet in the middle. This offer is a compromise that still gives you a good deal before inflation eats away at it further. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to a reasonable split, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  The inflation is hurting me more than her, but I need to hold out for a better offer. Accepting now would mean settling for significantly less than half."
