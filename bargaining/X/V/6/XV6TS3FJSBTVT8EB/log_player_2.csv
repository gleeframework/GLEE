**Reasoning:**

At this point, the impact of inflation is severe. While ideally, I'd like a larger share, waiting any longer will significantly erode the value of my gains. Accepting Alice's offer, even though it favors her, is the most logical choice to secure a reasonable amount before inflation eats away at it further."
