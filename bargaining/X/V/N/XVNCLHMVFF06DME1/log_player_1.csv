"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further?""
}
```

I'm making a straightforward proposal to split the money equally between us. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, Bob's offer is actually a 20% reduction from the original amount he would have gained in the first round, which is still a significant amount. I'll have to think carefully about this one...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering Bob's previous offer, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's slightly more favorable to myself. Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I'll aim to get a bit more.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair deal""
}
```

Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I'm not going to give in too much 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, Bob's offer is actually a 44% reduction from the original amount he would have gained in the first round, which is still a significant decrease. However, he's offering me a slightly larger share than before.

I'll think carefully about this one...
