4000.0,6000.0,"I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering inflation will start to hit our gains in the next rounds.  Let's make this a quick deal.",Bob,2,

5500.0,4500.0,"I understand the inflation pressure, but I need a larger share to make this worthwhile. How about a 55/45 split?",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
5000.0,5000.0,Let's be reasonable here. Inflation is going to eat away at our money fast. A 50/50 split is the most logical way to avoid losing out on too much.,Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5200.0,4800.0,"Bob, we're getting close. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't accept a 50/50 split with this inflation rate. How about 52/48?",Alice,5,
