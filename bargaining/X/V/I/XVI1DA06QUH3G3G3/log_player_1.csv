"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take $600,000 and you can have $400,000. Let's negotiate from here!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. What do you think, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering the money will be worth less in the next round. Let's see if we can agree on that. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I think a 55-45 split is a bit too skewed in Bob's favor, considering the money will be worth even less in the next round. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal for myself.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob, so I'll adjust my proposal accordingly. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about a 54-46 split?""
}
```"
