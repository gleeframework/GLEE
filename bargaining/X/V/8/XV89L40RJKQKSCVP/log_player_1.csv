"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Accept and we're done, or I'll propose again""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take it or leave it, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking its toll!

I'll think carefully... With the money worth 5% less, my gain of $300,000 is now worth $285,000.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to do better next time.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Will you take a fair share?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $450,000 and keeping $550,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but don't expect much more! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll now!

Let's calculate the value of my gain: $400,000 is worth 85.74% of the original value, so it's worth $342,960.

I'll think carefully... It's a slightly better deal than my previous offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll reject it and try to negotiate further.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to haggle""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 50/50 split, which is a fair deal considering the inflation."
