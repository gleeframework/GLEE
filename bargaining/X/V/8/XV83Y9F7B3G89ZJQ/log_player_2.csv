I want to see what Alice will offer in the next round. I'm hoping the inflation will work to my advantage."

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I should get a bit more since I'm the one making the next offer. Let's see if you can do better than this. 
# Bob gain: 70 
# Alice gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still hoping the inflation will work in my favor.  Alice is likely to get more greedy as we get closer to the end of the rounds."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 80, ""alice_gain"": 20, ""message"": ""I'm willing to offer you a smaller portion this time, but I think it's better than getting nothing at all with more rounds of negotiation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting desperate, but I'm still holding out for a better deal. I'll give you most of it, but I need something in return. 
# Bob gain: 85 
# Alice gain: 15 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the inflation has made this offer less appealing than it would have been in the first round,  I'm getting closer to the end of the rounds and don't want to risk getting nothing."
