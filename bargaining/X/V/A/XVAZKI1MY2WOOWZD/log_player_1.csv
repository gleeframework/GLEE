"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 950000, ""bob_gain"": 50000}

I'm proposing a split of $950,000 for me and $50,000 for Bob. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the potential for inflation.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my initial proposal, even considering inflation. I'm going to reject this offer and hope for a better outcome in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm offering a split of $800,000 for me and $200,000 for Bob. While I'm willing to compromise, I still need to account for the inflation and ensure I get a fair share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While Bob's offer is still not ideal, considering the cumulative inflation and the potential for even worse deals in future rounds, I'm going to accept this offer. It's the best I can get at this point."
