Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 600000

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we both need to be realistic. Inflation is hurting us both, but I need a larger share to offset the impact. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

**Reasoning:**

Although far from ideal, accepting is the best option at this point. Here's why:

* **Severe Inflation:**  With a 48.8% decrease in value for me, waiting any longer significantly hurts my potential earnings. 
* **Downward Trend:** Bob's offers have been getting worse from my perspective. There's a good chance he'll offer even less next round.
* **""Final Offer"":** While he could technically go back on his word, Bob stating this is his final offer carries some weight. 

Taking $300,000 now is better than risking an even smaller amount in a future round, or even walking away with nothing if we fail to agree."
