  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can finalize the deal.""

# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

I'm not thrilled about the offer, but it's a significant improvement from my initial offer. Considering the inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this. I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer or risk going to the next round and potentially facing even more severe inflation.

For now, I'll reject the offer and hope for a better deal in the next round.

However, I'm not willing to give up yet. Bob's offer is still a bit better than my previous one, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject this offer and hope that Bob will make an even better one in the next round.
