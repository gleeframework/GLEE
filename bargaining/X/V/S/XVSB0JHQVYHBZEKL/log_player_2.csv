Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to compromise. I'm taking a significant cut from my initial offer, showing I'm serious about reaching an agreement.  Let's end this, and we both get a good chunk of the money. 
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting this offer makes sense for a few reasons:

* **Inflation:**  The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for both of us. Waiting longer means getting even less in real terms.
* **Alice's movement:** Alice significantly lowered her demand. This suggests she's feeling the pressure of the devaluation and wants to settle.
* **Future uncertainty:** There's no guarantee Alice will offer anything close to this amount in subsequent rounds. She might become more desperate, but we also risk getting even less. 

This is a compromise, but waiting any longer could easily backfire."
