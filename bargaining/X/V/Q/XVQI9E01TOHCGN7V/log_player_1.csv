"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, I'll take the lion's share""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the money, which is $8,000, and Bob gets the remaining 20%, which is $2,000. I'm framing it as a 4:1 split, which I think is a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, no more negotiations 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to adjust my thinking to account for the inflation.

Since the money is worth 10% less for me, $5000 is now equivalent to $5,000 in the first round, which is a significant reduction from my original proposal.

I'll decide to reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the inflation and the fact that Bob's offer was 50/50, which is a significant concession from his initial message.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, I'll take a smaller share""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, which is a bit more favorable to me, but still a compromise from my original 80/20 proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but still fair 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money!

Considering the reduced value of the money, Bob's offer is actually quite generous. If I accept, I'll be getting $4,000, which is equivalent to $5,556 in the first round, and Bob will get $6,000, which is equivalent to $6,667 in the first round.

I'll decide to accept this offer, as it seems like a fair compromise given the changing circumstances.
