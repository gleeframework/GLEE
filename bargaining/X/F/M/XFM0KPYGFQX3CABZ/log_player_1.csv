"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nMy reasoning is that since the money loses value faster for Bob, he has a greater incentive to accept offers sooner rather than later. By offering him a significant but not equal share, I'm testing his willingness to negotiate while also trying to maximize my gain, considering the impact of inflation on both of us. This initial offer sets a benchmark for future negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split, considering the money will be worth less with each passing round. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nMy reasoning is that accepting this offer would mean I'm getting significantly less than what I initially proposed, and the difference in the amounts we gain is quite large. Considering the inflation rate, even though the money is worth less with each passing round, I believe there's room for further negotiation to reach a more balanced split. By rejecting, I'm aiming to pressure Bob into a compromise that's more favorable to me in the subsequent rounds, given that he also faces a higher rate of value loss."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, let's meet closer to the middle""}\n\nMy reasoning is that by moving closer to an equal split but still favoring myself, I'm acknowledging the impact of inflation on both of us while trying to maintain an advantage. Given that Bob's previous offer was heavily skewed in his favor and that he faces a higher rate of inflation, I'm hoping this offer will be seen as a reasonable compromise, increasing the likelihood of him accepting before the money devalues further."
