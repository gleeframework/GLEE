I'm starting with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept and we can both get a decent chunk of the money.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much worse than my initial offer, and while I understand the inflation is hitting me harder, I'm not willing to settle for such a small share.  I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 810000, ""bob_gain"": 190000}
```

I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway, but still ensure I get the majority of the money.  The inflation is starting to hurt, but I think I can still secure a good deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse each round, and the inflation is really taking its toll.  I'm still not willing to accept such a small share. I'll try to push for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 729000, ""bob_gain"": 271000} 
```

I'm trying to be reasonable here, but the inflation is getting out of hand. This is my last offer before we risk losing everything."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though the inflation has reduced my share significantly, Bob's offer is starting to get close to what I would consider fair.  It's a 50/50 split, and I'm not sure I can push for a better deal with the way the inflation is going.  I'll take it."
