"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose a 90/10 split, with me getting $900,000 and Bob getting $100,000.  Let's see if he thinks it's fair."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer. Although my share is worth less now due to inflation, Bob's share is worth 10% less. I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm proposing a 70/30 split, with me receiving $700,000 and Bob receiving $300,000.  This is a compromise that accounts for the inflation, while still giving me a good share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While my share is significantly less than what I initially hoped for, considering the inflation and the fact that Bob's share is also considerably reduced, I'll accept this offer.  It's better to secure something than to risk getting nothing in the following rounds."
