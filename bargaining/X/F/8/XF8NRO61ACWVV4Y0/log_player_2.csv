"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. Take a small slice of the pie.  We both get something this way! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
I'm Bob, and I'm going to play this game strategically. Alice's offer is extremely lopsided in her favor. While a guaranteed 100,000 is tempting, I believe I can do better if I reject and wait for my turn to make a proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle, Alice. A fair deal for both of us.""
