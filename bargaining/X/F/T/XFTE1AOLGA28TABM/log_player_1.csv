"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

This is a fair and straightforward proposal, but I'm sure Bob will try to negotiate!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but you can still get 40% of the total. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Not bad, Bob thinks he's got the upper hand!

I'll reject this offer. I'd like to aim for a better deal. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Meet me halfway, you can get a better deal than 40%""
}
```

This offer is a bit more generous than my initial proposal, but still leaves room for negotiation. Let's see how Bob responds!"
