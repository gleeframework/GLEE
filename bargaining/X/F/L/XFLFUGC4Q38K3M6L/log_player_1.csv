"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $100, which is $40, and keeping 60% for myself, which is $60."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'm hoping to get more later! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money has decreased due to inflation!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to accept it since it's the best I can get at this point. The offer is:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, I'll take the 30, but don't think you're getting off that easy!""
}
```

I'll take the $30, which is worth 30% of the original $100, and Bob will get $70, which is worth 70% of the original $100."
