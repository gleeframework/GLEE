This is a high-risk, high-reward strategy.  I'm offering Bob a tiny amount, hoping he'll reject it and give me the opportunity to make a more balanced proposal in the next round. However, if he accepts, I get almost all the money!  Let's see what he does."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I would have preferred to get more, this is a fair and balanced offer.  It's a good way to split the money, and the inflation factor would make any further rounds riskier.  Let's take the deal!"
