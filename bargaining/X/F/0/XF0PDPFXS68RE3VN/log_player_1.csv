Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point.""}

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and we can adjust from here if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering I'm the one making the offer this round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I'm willing to consider it.
