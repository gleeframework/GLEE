"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair. You get a decent share, I get the bulk. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not satisfied with getting only 10% of the total amount. I think I can get a better deal in the next round.\n\n###\n\nPlease relay my decision to Alice and let me know what she proposes in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's more in my favor. Since the money is worth 5% less in each round, I'll take that into account in my proposal.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 420000, ""alice_gain"": 580000, ""message"": ""Let's split it in a way that's more fair, considering the decreasing value of money.""}\n\nPlease relay my offer to Alice.\n\n###\n\n###\n\n### 420000 is 42% and 580000 is 58% of 1,000,000$.\n\nAfter the first round, the money lost 5% of its value. So now the money is worth 950,000$. But the players don't see it, they still see 1,000,000$. The game master will take care of the inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still the one who needs to make the most from this.  Let's split it 60/40, otherwise we'll both get less in the next round. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm still not satisfied with the offer. Although the money is losing value, I think I can get a better deal in the next round. Alice is trying to rush me into accepting, but I'll take my chances.\n\nPlease relay my decision to Alice and let me know what she proposes in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make another counteroffer, taking into account the decreasing value of money. Since we're in the fourth round, the money has lost a significant amount of its original value. I'll try to split it in a way that's more favorable to me, while still being reasonable for Alice.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 480000, ""alice_gain"": 520000, ""message"": ""We're both losing value with each passing round. Let's split it in a way that's more equal, considering the circumstances.""}\n\nPlease relay my offer to Alice.\n\n###\n\n###\n\nAfter 3 rounds, the money lost 14.26% of its value. So now the money is worth 857,100$. But the players don't see it, they still see 1,000,000$. The game master will take care of the inflation."
