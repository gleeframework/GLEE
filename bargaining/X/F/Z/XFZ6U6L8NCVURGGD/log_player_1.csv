Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55:45 split in our favor. This is a fair compromise considering the diminishing value of money for me in future rounds. Let's end this game and get our share. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
