"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! I'm willing to give you a small share, but I think I deserve the majority of the money.""
}
```

This way, I get 90% of the initial $10,000, and Bob gets 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more equitable split is fair. Let's both get a decent share. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think 55% for Bob is a bit too generous, considering I'm still the one making the initial proposal. I'd like to see a more balanced split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I still think I deserve the majority of the money.""
}
```

This way, I get 70% of the initial $10,000, and Bob gets 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it closer to 60/40. This is a fair compromise that will allow us both to walk away with a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer for Round 4:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
