"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""My turn to propose a fair split. Let's wrap this up!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Value of Money:**  It's crucial to end the game quickly. While Alice loses value at 5% per round, Bob loses a whopping 20%. Every round that passes significantly hurts Bob's potential earnings.
* **Turning the Tables:** Alice's initial offer of 55/45 was slightly in her favor. By mirroring the offer, Bob puts the pressure on Alice. She now faces the same choice she presented to Bob: accept a slightly unfavorable deal or risk losing more value in the next round.
* **Direct and Concise:** The message aims for a swift resolution. Prolonging negotiations only benefits Alice due to the inflation disparity."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, let's meet in the middle! 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Inflation Impact:** The inflation is severely impacting Bob.  A 48/52 split in round 3 is worth significantly less than a 45/55 split in round 1. Waiting any longer will only hurt Bob more.
* **Alice is Unlikely to Budge Much:** Alice has consistently aimed for a slightly advantageous position. It's unlikely she'll offer significantly more than 48 in subsequent rounds.
* **Minimizing Losses:** Accepting a slightly unfavorable deal now is better than risking a worse outcome later due to the rapidly decreasing value of the money for Bob."
