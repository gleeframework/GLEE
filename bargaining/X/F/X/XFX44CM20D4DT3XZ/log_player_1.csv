"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose to keep $9,000 and give Bob $1,000.  This seems fair, as it gives me the majority share while still offering Bob a small but non-negligible amount. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred to keep more, the inflation means that my potential gains in the next round will be significantly lower. Accepting a 50/50 split is the best option to maximize my return at this point."
