Round 2

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to go down a bit, but I still think I deserve the larger share. 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the offer is getting closer to a more even split, time is running out. Accepting Alice's offer at this stage would mean accepting significantly less than half of the initial amount due to inflation. It's worth risking another counter-offer in the hopes of securing a better deal, even if it means settling for slightly less than 50%."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 57, ""alice_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Time is running out!  This is my final offer. Let's split the difference and get something!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm still not convinced. I'll give you a bit more, but that's it. 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The game has reached a critical point. While the offer is still significantly in Alice's favor, rejecting it carries a massive risk.  With each round, the inflation eats further into any potential gains for me. Accepting this offer guarantees a payout, albeit smaller than desired.  Continuing the game is a gamble that Alice will become more generous, and the rapidly increasing inflation makes that outcome less and less likely."
