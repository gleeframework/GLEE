"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""bob_gain"": 6000
}
```

This way, I'll get 40% and Bob will get 60% of the initial $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 5% less than the previous round, so I'll have to be more careful with my decision.

After considering Bob's offer, I'll reject it. I'd like to see if I can get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, the money is now worth 10% less than the initial amount. I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
