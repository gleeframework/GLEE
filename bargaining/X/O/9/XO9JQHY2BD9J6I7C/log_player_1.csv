"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose taking $9,000 and giving Bob $1,000. I think this is a fair split, and it gives me a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
It's better to accept this offer. Even though I'm getting less than my initial proposal, the inflation means that I'll end up with less money if we continue. A 50/50 split is fair, and I'm not sure I can get a better deal."
