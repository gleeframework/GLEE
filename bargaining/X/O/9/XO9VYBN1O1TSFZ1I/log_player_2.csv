"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and you can have the remaining 10%. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting this offer as it's highly unfair to me. I'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer.\n\n###\n\nPlease proceed to the next round. I'll make a proposal that is more reasonable for both of us, considering the inflation factor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I'll take 60% and you can have 40%. It's a fair offer given the circumstances.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease relay this message to Alice and let me know her decision."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think we can split it more evenly given the inflation.  I'm proposing 60/40, which is more in line with my initial offer and still accounts for the change in value for you. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting this offer as it still doesn't fairly account for the impact of inflation on my gain. Given that the money is worth 19% less to me now, I believe a more balanced offer is needed.\n\n###\n\nPlease proceed to the next round. I'll consider the decreasing value of the money in my next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.

Considering this, I propose a 55/45 split, which I believe is more reasonable under the current circumstances.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease relay this message to Alice and let me know her decision."
