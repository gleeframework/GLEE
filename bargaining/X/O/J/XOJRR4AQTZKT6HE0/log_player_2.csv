"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects the urgency for you to secure a reasonable amount due to the higher inflation working against you.

# Alice gain: 6000

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we need to find a compromise quickly. This offer is a small adjustment from my initial proposal, acknowledging the inflation we both face. 
# Bob gain: 4060 
# Alice gain: 5940 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is slightly acknowledging the inflation, the offer is still heavily skewed in her favor. The small decrease in her share doesn't compensate for the significant loss Bob continues to face with each round.  It's worth risking another counter-offer to try and get a more equitable split."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time. This offer is my bottom line. It accounts for the inflation disparity and is fair given the remaining rounds."" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** With each round, the value of the money decreases significantly for both players. It's crucial to reach an agreement sooner rather than later.
* **Firm but Fair:** This offer is a strong statement that Bob is serious about getting a reasonable share, but it's not so extreme that Alice would dismiss it outright. 
* **Inflation Disparity:** The offer still leans slightly in Alice's favor, acknowledging that her losses due to inflation are lower than Bob's."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but I also need to look out for myself. This is my final offer that still gives you a decent share considering the quickly devaluing pot. 
# Bob gain: 4213 
# Alice gain: 5787 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Time is running out, and the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. While not ideal, Alice's offer is barely better than the previous round and significantly better than what Bob can expect if he rejects and the negotiations continue.  

Here's why accepting is the best course of action now:

* **Diminishing Returns:** Holding out for a better offer in later rounds is increasingly risky. The potential gains are shrinking faster than the losses incurred from inflation. 
* **Alice's Stance:** Her language suggests this is her final offer, and further negotiation might lead to a worse deal or no deal at all.
* **Something is Better Than Nothing:**  If Bob rejects this offer and no agreement is reached in the remaining rounds, they both walk away with nothing."
