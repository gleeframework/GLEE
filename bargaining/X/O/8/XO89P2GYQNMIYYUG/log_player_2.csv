While Alice's offer is fair, I'm going to see if I can do better by holding out for more!  I'm Bob, and I'm not afraid to gamble a little.  Let's see what Alice offers next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than a 60/40 split.  Let's be a little more greedy this time, but still try to be fair.  If you agree, we can finish the game now.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the impact of inflation, let's find a middle ground that benefits both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd love to get more, the inflation is hitting me hard, and Alice's offer is a good compromise.  I'm accepting!"
