45.0,55.0,"I think 55/45 is a more reasonable split. The money is now worth 5% less, so let's be realistic about what we can get.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"Bob, I understand your point about inflation, but I'm still aiming for a slightly more favorable split. How about we meet in the middle at 55/45?",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
43.0,57.0,"Considering the money is now worth almost 10% less, I think 57/43 is a fair split. We need to come to an agreement soon before the money loses even more value.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
52.0,48.0,"Bob, we're running out of time, and the money is losing value quickly.  This offer recognizes that while you want a bit more, we both lose if we don't agree soon.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
42.0,58.0,"I understand the urgency, but I'm still aiming for a better split. Considering the significant loss of value, I think 58/42 is a reasonable compromise.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
50.0,50.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous. The money is losing value with every passing minute. Let's just split it 50/50 and call it a day!",Alice,7,
