"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slight lean towards me, but still fair 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, my potential gain of $4000 is worth 80% of the original $5000, due to the 20% inflation.

I'm not thrilled about the lean towards Bob, but I'll consider the offer. I'll reject it for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 80% of its original value after the first round, and another 20% was lost in the second round, my potential gain is now worth 64% of the original $5000, which is $3200.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3200,
  ""bob_gain"": 6800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of!""
}
```

I'm trying to negotiate a better deal for myself, while still being somewhat generous. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, but it's still a good deal for you 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection! Okay, let's calculate my potential gain in this round... Since the money is worth 48.8% of its original value, my potential gain of $2500 is actually worth 61.2% of the original $5000, which is $3060.

I'm not thrilled about the lean towards Bob, but I'll consider the offer. I'll reject it for now.

# Bob gain: 8000
