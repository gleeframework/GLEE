Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  My offer is more than fair considering the inflation is hitting you harder. Let's be reasonable and end this here. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
