"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```
This way, I get 80% of the initial $100, and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, but I'm willing to compromise. I accept Bob's offer.
