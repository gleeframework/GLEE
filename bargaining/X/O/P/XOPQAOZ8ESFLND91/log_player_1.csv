"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly, Bob. This is a good starting point.""
}
```

I'm offering to take $8,000 and leaving $2,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to get closer to a fair split, Alice. This is a good starting point for further negotiations. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $5,000 in Round 2 is actually worth $4,500 ($5,000 * 0.9).

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm comfortable with a 50-50 split, Bob. I'd like to try to negotiate further.""
}
```

I'd like to propose a counteroffer in Round 3."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 10% less than in Round 2, so my gain of $4,500 in Round 2 is actually worth $4,050 ($4,500 * 0.9).

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. This is a good middle ground.""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leaving $4,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give a bit more, Alice. This is a fair compromise for me. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $6,000 in Round 3 is actually worth $4,380 ($6,000 * 0.727).

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""This seems like a fair compromise, Bob. I'll accept your offer.""
}
```

I'll take $4,500 and Bob will take $5,500."
