"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take 60% and you can have 40%.""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the $100, which is $60, and Bob gets the remaining 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair to split the money more evenly, considering the inflation factor. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm considering Bob's offer.

Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'm not affected by the 10% inflation. However, Bob's gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.

Bob's offer is 45% for me and 55% for him. While it's not a drastic change, I'm willing to accept this offer since it's a slight improvement from my initial proposal. I'll take the 45% and Bob can have the 55%.
