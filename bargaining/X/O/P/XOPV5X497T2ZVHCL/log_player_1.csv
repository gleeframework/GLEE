"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a reasonable division""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I receive $6,000 and Bob receives $4,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will agree to this proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You got the smaller share this time, but it's still a good offer 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think this offer is fair. I was hoping for a more balanced split, and this proposal gives Bob a much larger share of the money. I'd like to make a counteroffer and try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and split it 50/50""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, where we both receive $5,000. I think this is a fair and reasonable division, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer."
