I'm going to be greedy in the first round and see if Bob is willing to accept a very small share.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is a fair offer. I don't want to risk getting nothing, and 500,000 is a good amount.  Let's accept!"
