"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a fair and reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but the money Bob gains is worth 20% less, this means Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a better deal.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. I'll make a new proposal, taking into account the inflation and trying to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

I'm offering a slightly better deal for myself, but still trying to be reasonable and leave room for negotiation."
