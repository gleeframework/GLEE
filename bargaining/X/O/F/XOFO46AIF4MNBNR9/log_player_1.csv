Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm proposing a very lopsided split in my favor.  I'm hoping Bob will be so surprised by the audacity of it, he'll accept just to see what happens. If not, I'll have to be more strategic in the coming rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

A fair split is better than risking getting nothing at all. Let's see if Bob is willing to be more generous in future rounds."
