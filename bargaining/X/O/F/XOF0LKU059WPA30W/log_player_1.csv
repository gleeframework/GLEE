"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair and simple split""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I take 60 dollars and Bob takes 40 dollars. This is a straightforward and fair division, and I hope Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You got lucky last round, now it's my turn to get a better deal! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 45-55 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Since Bob's offer is not as bad as the initial 60-40 split, I'll accept this one.
