"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

This is a very aggressive first offer, but I'm hoping to secure a large portion of the money early on before inflation significantly affects Bob's potential gain."

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While Bob's offer is tempting, I believe I can still get a better deal. My portion remains the same, but the inflation will significantly impact Bob's future gains, making him more likely to accept a lower offer in the coming rounds."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
``` 

I'm lowering my offer slightly to 800,000 for myself, but I'm still aiming for a significant portion of the money. Bob is now facing more pressure due to the inflation, and I believe he'll be more inclined to accept a deal that gives him a smaller share than he initially proposed."

{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}

# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While this is a much more favorable offer for me than Bob's previous proposal, inflation is still heavily impacting his potential gains. I believe I can secure a larger portion of the money by holding out for a few more rounds."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I'm continuing to lower my offer, but I'm still aiming for a majority share. Bob's potential gains are diminishing rapidly due to inflation, and I'm hoping this will be the offer that finally convinces him."

Even though Bob's offer is getting closer to my target, I still believe I can secure a slightly larger share. The pressure of inflation is building on Bob, and I'm confident he'll come around to a more favorable offer for me in the next few rounds."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

I'm continuing to lower my offer, but I'm still aiming for a majority share. Inflation is now having a major impact on Bob's potential gains, making him increasingly desperate to secure some portion of the money. I believe this offer is a good compromise that provides him with a decent share while still allowing me to keep a larger portion."

Round 10

```

Bob's offer is getting very close to my desired outcome.  Even though it's a bit lower than my last offer, the inflation has drastically reduced the value of Bob's potential gains. I don't want to risk getting nothing by continuing to reject offers. Accepting this will give me a substantial portion of the money."
