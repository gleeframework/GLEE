"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I believe this is a fair split to begin our negotiations. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's tempting to accept, but it's better to see if we can get a better deal. By rejecting, I get to make the next offer and control the negotiation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Let's start with a more even split, Alice. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. I'm offering you a good deal considering the inflation. This split benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
While it's a better offer than the first, I believe we can still get a more even split. Let's keep negotiating!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to compromise. This split is fair considering the inflation, and I believe it's a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a very reasonable offer considering the time pressure and inflation. Let's close this deal and avoid further losses for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

With the inflation hitting Alice harder, her offers are getting more appealing. While I'd prefer a 50/50 split, this is a good deal considering the time pressure and the fact that Alice will soon have little left to gain."
