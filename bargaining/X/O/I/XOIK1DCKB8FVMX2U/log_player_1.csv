"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself, which is a 60-40 split in my favor. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a reasonable offer and accept it, given that the money will lose value over time if we don't come to an agreement soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the inflation rate we need to account for. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, considering the inflation, I think I can get a better deal in the next round. The 60/40 split he's offering is the same as my initial proposal, but now the money is worth less due to inflation. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to try to get a better share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet in the middle""}\n\nI'm offering a 58-42 split in my favor, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and accept it, given that the money will continue to lose value if we don't come to an agreement soon."
