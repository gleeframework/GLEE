"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 40, I'll get 60. Let's end it here.""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount and can end the game early."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but still a good deal 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 70 is actually worth 56 (70 * 0.8) and Bob's gain of 30 is worth 27 (30 * 0.9).

I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a smaller share, but I think this is a fair deal considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm offering a smaller share to Bob, but still trying to get a decent amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a larger share, but I think I should get something for the risk of waiting 
# Alice gain: 85 
# Bob gain: 15 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 85 is actually worth 49.6 (85 * 0.58) and Bob's gain of 15 is worth 11.35 (15 * 0.757).

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, considering the risk of waiting and the decreasing value of the money.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer.

  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""I'm not getting any younger, let's end this already and I'll take the majority of the remaining cash.""
}
```

I'm being a bit more aggressive with this offer, but I think I'm taking a risk by giving Bob such a small share."

# Alice gain: 95

Considering the rapidly decreasing value of the money, I think I should take what I can get.
