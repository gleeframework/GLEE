"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. My message to Bob is a friendly one, suggesting a fair starting point for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can't get it all, but I'm willing to give you a smaller share. Your turn! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gain, I need to be more cautious. Considering the 10% decrease in the value of my gain, I'm now looking at a gain of $5,400 (60% of $9,000, which is 90% of the original $10,000).

Bob's offer of $3,000 for me and $7,000 for himself is still a significant difference, but I'm willing to consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer and looking to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 10% less again, I'm now looking at a gain of $4,200 (42% of $10,000). Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""Meet me halfway, let's split it 42-58!""
}
```

My message to Bob is a call to compromise, suggesting a 42-58 split in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up my lead! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gain, I'm now looking at a gain of $3,600 (36% of $10,000, which is 90% of the original $10,000 after 3 rounds of 10% decrease). Considering Bob's offer of $4,000 for me and $6,000 for himself, I think it's a slightly more favorable split for me than before, but I'm not convinced I'm getting the best deal.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer and looking to negotiate further."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 27.1% less than the original, I'm now looking at a gain of $2,280 (22.8% of $10,000, which is 90% of the original $10,000 after 4 rounds of 10% decrease). Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 2800,
  ""bob_gain"": 7200,
  ""message"": ""Let's compromise, I'll take a smaller share to keep the game going!""
}
```

My message to Bob is a message of compromise, suggesting a 22.8-77.2 split in his favor."
