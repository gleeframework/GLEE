# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to propose a counteroffer in the next round. Please let me know when it's my turn!"

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The inflation hurts me more than you.  I'll take a slight majority at 51% - it's a compromise. 
# Bob gain: 490000 
# Alice gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make another proposal. The inflation is indeed affecting the value, but I believe we can find a better compromise."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 580000, ""alice_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Given the increasing impact of inflation, especially on your end, I'm willing to take a bit more to compensate for the future loss but still offer you a considerable share. Let's settle this before it devalues further!""}\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know Alice's decision."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer. I understand the inflation is working in your favor, but I need a decent share. 47% is the lowest I can go. Let's end this. 
# Bob gain: 530000 
# Alice gain: 470000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nGiven the impact of inflation on both of our potential gains, Alice's offer seems reasonable at this point. Continuing further risks devaluing the money even more, likely resulting in a worse outcome for both of us. Accepting this offer provides a fair compromise considering the circumstances."
