"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
 
I propose that Alice receives $9,000 and Bob receives $1,000.  This is a fairly generous offer considering the inflation risk.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is much lower than my initial proposal.  I'm still willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to accept a 50/50 split, especially with the inflation risk. Let's see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000} 
``` 

I'm proposing a 70/30 split, with Alice getting $7,000 and Bob getting $3,000. This should be a more attractive offer for Bob than the previous round, while still leaving me with a reasonable share. Let's see if he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While I'm losing more money due to inflation, Bob's offer is still not fair. I'm not going to accept a 40/60 split, especially considering that I started the negotiation. Let's see what I can get in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, with Alice getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. This is a compromise from my previous offer, but it's still a fair split considering the inflation we're facing. Let's see if Bob will finally accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly unfavorable, and I'm losing a significant amount due to inflation. I'm not going to accept a 30/70 split, especially since I made the initial proposal. I'm hoping for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split.  Inflation is making it hard to make a profit, and we are running out of rounds. This is the most fair offer I can make, and I hope Bob will accept."
