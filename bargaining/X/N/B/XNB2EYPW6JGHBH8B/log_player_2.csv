"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I think this is a fair split that gives us both a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'd like to try to get a better deal. It's only round 1, and I don't want to settle for 40% of the total amount just yet. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Alice, considering the inflation, I think this is a generous offer. You should take it before the money loses more value!""}\n\n###\nI've decided to make an offer that gives me a bit more than half of the total amount. Since Alice is affected by inflation, I'm hoping she'll be motivated to accept this offer before the money loses more value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my turn to be generous. Let's wrap this up - time is money! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'm going to reject this offer. Although Alice is being affected by inflation, her offer still doesn't give me as much as I was hoping for. Since my potential gain isn't decreasing in value, I can afford to wait and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round. Maybe Alice will be more willing to compromise as the value of her potential gain continues to decrease."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Alice, the inflation is really taking its toll on your potential gain. I think it's time for us to settle - this is a fair offer considering the circumstances. If you reject, I'll just wait it out and you'll end up with even less.""}\n\n###\nIn this round, I've decided to make an offer that gives me an even larger share of the total amount. Since Alice's potential gain is decreasing in value due to inflation, I'm hoping she'll feel the pressure to accept this offer. I'm also trying to negotiate by pointing out that if she rejects, she'll likely end up with even less in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest option.  I'm not going lower. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nI've decided to accept Alice's offer of a 50/50 split. Although I was trying to negotiate for a better deal, Alice has made it clear that she's not willing to go lower. Considering that my potential gain isn't decreasing in value due to inflation, a 50/50 split is a reasonable outcome. It's also worth noting that Alice's gain is worth significantly less than it was in the first round, so she's actually losing value by continuing to negotiate. By accepting this offer, I'm securing a fair share of the total amount and ending the game."
