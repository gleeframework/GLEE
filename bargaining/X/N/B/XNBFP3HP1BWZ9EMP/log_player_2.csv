**Explanation:**

Although my gains are worth significantly less due to inflation, accepting this offer is the best option. Here's why:

* **Risk of further rejection:**  If I reject, I have to make an offer in round 6. Inflation will reduce my potential gains even further, making it harder to get Alice to accept.
* **Equal split:**  A 50/50 split is the fairest outcome, even with the inflation. While I would have preferred more, this is the best I can realistically hope for.

By accepting, I avoid the risk of getting even less in the next round."
