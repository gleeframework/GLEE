"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth less for Bob, I'm inclined to accept a lower share for myself. However, 60 seems like a reasonable offer, considering the reduced value of the money for Bob.

I accept the offer.
