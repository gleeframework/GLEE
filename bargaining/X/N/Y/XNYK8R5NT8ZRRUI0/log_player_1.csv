"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 40, and I'll take 60.""
}
```

This is a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, but I want 60 for myself. It's a good deal, don't you think? 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to get a better deal for himself.

I'll have to think carefully about this one...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not going to accept Bob's offer, as I'd rather try to get a better deal for myself. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again.

Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. I'll give you 45, and I'll take 55. It's a fair deal, don't you think?""
}
```

I'm trying to be more generous than in my first offer, but still keep a slight edge for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you in the middle. 50-50 seems fair to me. Let's end this game. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to meet me in the middle and end the game.

I'll consider this offer carefully...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think 50-50 is a fair split, and I'm willing to accept Bob's offer. It's not a bad deal for me, and it's better than continuing to negotiate. Let's end the game!"
