Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Bob gain: 45

While not ideal, accepting this offer is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The longer the game goes on, the less the money is worth. Accepting now guarantees a reasonable sum.
* **Bob's Position:** Bob is unlikely to offer significantly more in subsequent rounds, especially as he sees the value of the money diminishing for him at a faster rate. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Waiting for a slightly better offer carries the risk of Bob becoming more desperate and offering even less, or worse, time running out and both players getting nothing.

It's better to secure a decent amount now than risk ending up with nothing."
