"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 
I propose to take almost everything, leaving Bob with only $1.  Since the money is worth less to Bob in each round, he's likely to accept this offer rather than risk getting nothing in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer. Even though I'm only getting $100,000, I'm confident that I can get more in the next round. I'll be the one making the offer then, and I can take advantage of the decreasing value of money for Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose a 900,000 to 100,000 split.  Bob is facing a significant drop in the value of his share each round, and I believe this offer is enough to incentivize him to accept. If he rejects again, the value of his share will drop further, making it more likely he'll accept a similar offer in the next round."
