"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the $100 and Bob gets 40%. This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it to get the game started!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A small step towards the middle, let's see if Alice agrees 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more careful with the inflation!

Considering the reduced value of the money I'll gain, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth 20% less, $30 is now equivalent to $24 in the original value. That's a significant reduction!

I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer or reject it and try to do better in the next round.

For now, I'll decide to reject the offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 20% less again, I'll have to be even more strategic. In this round, $30 is equivalent to $24 in the original value, and I'm aiming to get as close to that as possible.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you the majority, but I'm not giving up yet!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 40% of the $100, which is equivalent to $32 in the original value. This is a more modest offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it to move the game forward!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice is getting desperate, but I'll give her a slightly better deal 
# Alice gain: 25 
# Bob gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is hitting me hard! The money I gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, which means $25 is equivalent to only $13.12 in the original value. That's a significant reduction!

Considering the offer, I'll have to think carefully about whether to accept it or reject it. If I reject it, the money I gain will be worth even less in the next round.

For now, I'll decide to reject the offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is really taking a toll on me! The money I gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, and it's getting harder to make ends meet.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 20,
  ""bob_gain"": 80,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, but I'm still fighting for what's left!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 20% of the $100, which is equivalent to $8.16 in the original value. This is a very modest offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it to move the game forward. I'm not sure how much longer I can afford to keep playing..."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice is running out of options, but I'll give her a tiny bit more 
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is really crushing me! The money I gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round, which means $15 is equivalent to only $2.33 in the original value. That's an incredibly small amount!

Considering the offer, I'll have to think carefully about whether to accept it or reject it. If I reject it, the money I gain will be worth even less in the next round.

However, I'm not sure if I can afford to reject this offer. With the money being worth so little, I'm starting to worry that I might not be able to get anything at all.

For now, I'll decide to accept the offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
