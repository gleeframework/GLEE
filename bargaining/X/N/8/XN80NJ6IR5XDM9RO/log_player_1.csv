"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial 100$ and Bob gets 40%. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script, I'll take 60 and leave you with 40. It's only fair to see both sides of the coin, right? 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not a fan of Bob's proposal. I'd rather not leave with only 40% of the remaining 100$.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll adjust my proposal accordingly. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground, 55-45 is a reasonable compromise""}

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the remaining 100$ and Bob gets 45%. I'm hoping this compromise will be more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm sticking with my previous offer.  60-40 is a fair split, considering the value of the money is decreasing with each round. Let's get this done before we both lose out. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's persistence with the same offer, especially considering the value of the money has decreased significantly. However, I don't want to risk losing out completely, so I'll consider it.
