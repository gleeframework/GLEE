"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we should be more equal. Let's try a 60/40 split. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to turn the tables on me!

However, I notice that Bob's offer is identical to my original offer in Round 1, which Bob rejected. I'm not sure if Bob has taken into account the inflation that has occurred since Round 1, which would make my gain worth less.

I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal, taking into account the inflation.

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll adjust my offer to account for the 5% decrease in value. Since my gain is worth 95% of its original value, I'll aim for a higher percentage to make up for it.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Compromise and we can finish this!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script from last round.  70/30 seems fair. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to flip the script, indeed!

However, I notice that Bob's offer is still not taking into account the inflation that has occurred since the first round. My gain is worth significantly less than it was initially, and I'm not sure if Bob is considering this in his offer.

I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal, taking into account the cumulative effect of the inflation.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the cumulative effect of the inflation, my gain is now worth significantly less than it was initially. I'll aim for a higher percentage to make up for it.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 850000,
  ""bob_gain"": 150000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, Bob, let's wrap this up!""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous.  Let's do the opposite of your last offer. 
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to rub it in, isn't he?

Considering the cumulative effect of the inflation, I'm getting desperate indeed! My gain is now worth a tiny fraction of what it was initially. I'll have to think carefully about this offer...

However, I'm not sure if Bob's offer is taking into account the fact that my gain is worth less than his. I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject this offer.

After some thought, I'll...
