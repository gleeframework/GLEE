"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, where we both get $50."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer...

Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'd like to negotiate a bit. I'll accept the offer, but only if Bob agrees to give me an extra $1. So, I'll accept the offer if Bob agrees to give me 50, and he gets 50.

If Bob agrees, I'll respond with {""decision"": ""accept""}. If not, I'll respond with {""decision"": ""reject""}."
