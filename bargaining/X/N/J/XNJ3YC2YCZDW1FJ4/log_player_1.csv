Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose to take $990,000 and give Bob $10,000.  This ensures I get the majority of the money, while still leaving Bob with a small portion.  Let's see if he'll accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, it's better to take what I can get.  With each passing round, my share will be worth less due to inflation.  This offer is at least a decent chunk of the money."
