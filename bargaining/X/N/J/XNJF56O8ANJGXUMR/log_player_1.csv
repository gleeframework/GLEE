"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, but I'm not giving up much 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about meeting in the middle, but I don't want to risk going to the next round with even less value. I'll accept Bob's offer.
