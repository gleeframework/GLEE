"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm offering a 900,000 / 100,000 split, favoring myself slightly. I expect Bob to accept this offer in the first round as he has no way to negotiate a better deal for himself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is worse for me than the initial offer. I'm going to reject it and hope for a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm offering a 800,000 / 200,000 split. I'm willing to reduce my share slightly to avoid another round of negotiation and ensure a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though Bob's offer is worse than my initial offer, it's still better than what I'd get if we keep playing. The inflation is starting to hurt Bob more, and it's likely he won't get a better deal in the next round."
