"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's divide fairly, considering the inflation 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer sounds fair on the surface, the inflation mechanic heavily favors me in later rounds.  Here's why:

* **Time is on my side:**  Each round, the value of the money decreases significantly for me. This means Alice is incentivized to make a deal sooner rather than later.
* **Future leverage:** As we get closer to the 12th round, my accepting even a tiny amount of money becomes increasingly appealing to Alice, as she gets nothing otherwise.

By rejecting this offer, I signal to Alice that I understand the game's dynamics and am willing to negotiate for a larger share, knowing my position strengthens over time."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to negotiate, but this inflation needs to be factored in. Let's try this.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Counter:** I've flipped the script, proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. This immediately highlights that the ""fair"" split shifts each round.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message emphasizes that this is a starting point for discussion. Alice is smart and likely anticipated a counter-offer.
* **Time Pressure:**  Every round that passes makes Alice's initial offer less appealing in retrospect. I'm applying pressure without being overly aggressive (yet)."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my offer is more generous than before 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to sweeten the deal slightly and frame it as generous, but she's not fully accounting for the speed at which the value diminishes on my side. Here's why I'm rejecting:

* **Still Behind the Curve:** Even with a slightly better offer, it's clear Alice wants to settle on a split where she gets the larger portion. My leverage is much greater than her slight increase reflects.
* **Inflation Accelerating:** A 36% decrease in value over just two rounds emphasizes how quickly things are changing.  Delay heavily favors me.
* **Holding Strong:** I need to show Alice I'm serious about getting a share that reflects the game's dynamics. Another rejection might push her to make a more substantial move in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""The clock is ticking, Alice. I'm being more than fair considering what this will be worth to me in a few more rounds.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Escalation:**  It's time to increase my demand significantly. The 70/30 split highlights the urgency of the situation.
* **Framing:** My message reinforces that the value for me rapidly diminishes with each passing round. It subtly suggests that future offers might be even less favorable to her if she continues to refuse.
* **Calculated Risk:** There's a risk Alice might call my bluff, believing I'll cave under pressure in later rounds. However, the substantial gap between our desired splits makes it clear I'm playing the long game and understand the advantage I hold."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're right, time is running out. But I still think I can do better than your last offer 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is feeling the pressure now, acknowledging the time constraint. However, her offer is still trying to anchor the agreement around a roughly 50/50 split, which is unacceptable given the rapidly shrinking pie from my perspective. Here's why I'm holding firm:

* **Marginal Improvement:** A $20,000 increase from her last offer is insignificant considering the rate of inflation. She needs to make a much more substantial jump to make this worthwhile for me.
* **Testing My Resolve:** Alice might be trying to gauge how serious I am about my demands. By continuing to reject these offers, I reinforce that my previous proposals weren't bluffs.
* **Approaching the Tipping Point:** We're nearing the halfway point of the rounds.  Soon, the value will diminish so much that even a 70/30 split might need to be reconsidered. Alice needs to realize this quickly."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 800000, ""alice_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time.  This is my final offer - take it or leave it.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Ultimatum:**  Six rounds in, it's time to lay down the law. This offer is a significant jump from my previous, but it's designed to force Alice's hand. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** By calling it my ""final offer,"" I'm creating a strong sense of urgency. She knows I'm serious about not settling for less.
* **Calculated Gamble:**  There's a risk Alice will walk away, but I'm betting she'll see the writing on the wall. The shrinking pot means even a 20% share now is better than nothing in a few rounds.
* **Potential for Adjustment:** If Alice flat-out rejects this offer, I still have some wiggle room to adjust slightly in the next round, but I need to convey the gravity of the situation now."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm not buying it. I think you'll still negotiate 
# Bob gain: 460000 
# Alice gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is right, I'm still willing to negotiate. However, her offer shows she's still significantly undervaluing my position. Here's why I'm rejecting:

* **Calling My Bluff:** She correctly identified my ""final offer"" tactic as pressure, not an absolute. I need to be careful not to lose credibility.
* **Trivial Increase:** This offer is barely better than her previous ones.  She needs to understand I'm serious about a much larger share.
* **Time Running Out:**  While I have rounds to spare, each rejection brings the value down dramatically.  I need to convey urgency without panicking. 

**The game has reached a crucial point.  My next offer needs to be a delicate balance between firmness and a willingness to still make a deal.  Alice is clearly tough, but I believe she'll concede more ground soon.**"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 750000, ""alice_gain"": 250000, ""message"": ""Alice, you're right, I'm still at the table.  But my patience - and the value of this deal - is fading fast.  Don't let this slip away.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Retreat:** I'm stepping back slightly from my ""final offer"" of 80/20, showing I'm willing to negotiate. However, the shift is small, emphasizing I'm not desperate.
* **Urgency Amplified:**  The message combines a conciliatory tone with a stark reminder of the dwindling value. The clock is ticking louder than ever.
* **Leaving Room to Maneuver:** While this offer is still heavily in my favor, it leaves space for a final counter-offer from Alice if she's smart. 

This is a calculated risk. Alice might sense weakness in my slight concession. But it's more likely she'll realize I'm serious about securing a significant share, and this offer is her best chance for a reasonable agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 83.22% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're getting desperate. I'm willing to compromise, but I still want the bigger share 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's attempt to portray me as desperate is laughable. While the shrinking pot is a factor, her offer still doesn't reflect the rapidly approaching point where *any* money is better than none for her. Here's why I'm standing firm:

* **Transparency:** She's being transparent about wanting the bigger share,  but fails to acknowledge the time-sensitive nature of that desire.  The longer she waits, the less meaningful ""bigger"" becomes. 
* **Marginal Gains, Major Losses:** A $40,000 increase for me is paltry at this stage, especially when measured against the massive value decrease each round brings.
* **Finality Approaching:** With only three rounds remaining after this, Alice is running out of runway to secure any deal, let alone one where she comes out ahead.  

**My next move is critical.** I need to find the balance between conveying the gravity of the situation and showing a willingness to make a deal before it's too late for *both* of us."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is it.  We're down to the wire.  I'm offering you a larger share than before, but this is my absolute final offer.  Take it, and we both walk away with something substantial.  Reject it, and we both risk getting zero.  The choice is yours.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality and Compromise:**  This offer combines my lowest acceptable share with a strong sense of finality.  The message is direct and avoids any hint of bluffing.
* **Shift in Emphasis:**  Instead of focusing solely on the dwindling value for me, I'm highlighting the risk to *both* of us if we fail to reach an agreement.  
* **Appealing to Logic:**  Alice is clearly a tough negotiator, but this offer appeals to her logical side. Getting 35% now is significantly better than gambling on an even smaller share (or nothing) in the few remaining rounds. 

This is a high-stakes gamble.  If Alice rejects this, I'll have to significantly adjust my strategy in the final rounds. However,  it's a calculated risk designed to secure a reasonable deal before time runs out for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 10.

Round 11
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 89.26% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're running out of time. I'll meet you in the middle. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

It's painful to accept a 50/50 split after holding out for so long. However, with only one round left after this, the risk of getting absolutely nothing is too high. Here's why I'm making this difficult decision:

* **Alice is Serious:** Her ""final offer"" and the 50/50 split suggest she's reached her limit.  She's gambling that I'll panic with time running out.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  While the remaining value is substantial, the 89.26% inflation means it's a shadow of what it was at the start. Another round means even a favorable split would yield a drastically smaller amount.
* **Certainty over Potential Loss:**  Taking $500,000 now guarantees a significant sum. Rejecting this offer risks a complete loss if Alice sticks to her guns in the final round.  

**It's a bitter pill to swallow, but it's the most logical choice given the circumstances.**"
