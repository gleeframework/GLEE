Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable.  We both took a hit from inflation, so a 50/50 split seems the fairest now.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nA 50/50 split seems reasonable at this point, considering the impact of inflation on both of our gains."
