"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which I think is a fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but still keep most of the money! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks he can get away with a 70-30 split, huh?

I'll think about it for a moment... 

I'll reject this offer. I'd like a better deal than that!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Time for me to make a new offer!

Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob! 55-45 split is a fair compromise.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still aiming for a slightly better deal for myself. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, but I'm not giving away too much more! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, inflation is really taking a toll on Bob's offer!

But, I have to say, this 50-50 split is looking pretty good. I'm not sure if I can do better than this.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
