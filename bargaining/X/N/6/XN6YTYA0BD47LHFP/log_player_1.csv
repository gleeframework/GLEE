"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split, giving me $900,000 and Bob $100,000. Let's see if he bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 800000 
# Bob gain: 200000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best course of action.  With each round, the value of the money decreases, and Bob's offer is still significantly better than what I'd likely get in the next round. It's time to secure what I can."
