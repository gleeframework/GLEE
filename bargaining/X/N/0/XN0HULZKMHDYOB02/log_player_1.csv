"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, it's a fair deal!""
}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we each get $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have a smaller share, but I'll give you a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too happy about the reduced offer, but I'll consider it. Here's my decision:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept a 40/60 split, especially since the money is worth less for me due to inflation. I'd like to make a counteroffer and try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer:

{
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""message"": ""I'll take a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise.""
}

I'm willing to give up a bit more to get a better deal, but I still want to get a decent share of the money."
