Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not giving up yet! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate as inflation erodes the value of her potential winnings. While her offer is slightly better, I believe I can push for an even larger share in the next round since her position is weakening."

Round 6

{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Alice, inflation is hurting your position. Take this offer before it's too late.""}

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation may be eating away, but I still want a fair share. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a game of chicken, and Alice is finally starting to crack.  While I'd prefer an even larger share, her offer is now barely better than a 50/50 split when considering the inflation. If I push further and she rejects, I risk ending up with nothing in later rounds where her desperation might lead her to accept a heavily unfavorable deal just to get something."
