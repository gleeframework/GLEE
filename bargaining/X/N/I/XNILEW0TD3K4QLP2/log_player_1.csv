"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

I'm offering you 200,000$ and keeping 800,000$ for myself. This is a generous offer, considering the potential for inflation to reduce the value of the money over time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, I'll consider the offer in terms of the actual value I'll receive. 

In this case, I'll receive 100,000$ which is equivalent to 80,000$ in the first round, so I'm actually getting less than what I initially offered. Considering this, I'll reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Now it's my turn again! Given the inflation, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

I'm offering you a smaller share this time, but I'm hoping you'll accept and we can finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the equivalent value of the money in the first round:

My gain of 300,000$ in this round is equivalent to 300,000 / 0.5208 = 576,923.05$ in the first round.

Considering this, I'm getting a smaller share than I initially offered, and it's also less than what I would have received if I had accepted my previous offer. Given the inflation, I'll decide to reject this offer.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the equivalent value of the money in the first round:

My gain of 450,000$ in this round is equivalent to 450,000 / 0.3243 = 1,389,017.51$ in the first round.

Considering this, I'm actually getting a larger share than I initially offered, and it's even more than what I would have received if I had accepted my previous offer. Given the significant inflation, I'll decide to accept this offer.
