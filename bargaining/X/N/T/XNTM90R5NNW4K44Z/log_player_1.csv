"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a fair share, let's end the game here""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 300,000$ and keeping 700,000$ for myself. I think this is a generous offer, and I'd like to end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take it or leave it, no more negotiations! 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of 600,000$ is now worth 90% of its original value, which is 540,000$. Bob's gain of 400,000$ is now worth 80% of its original value, which is 320,000$.

I'm not happy with this offer, as I think I'm getting a worse deal than in the first round. I'll reject it.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 630000,
  ""bob_gain"": 370000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting aggressive, let's try to find a compromise""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 370,000$ and keeping 630,000$ for myself. I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not giving up too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but don't expect any more! 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values:

My gain of 550,000$ is worth 73.9% of its original value, which is 736,500$ (550,000 * 0.739).
Bob's gain of 450,000$ is worth 51.2% of its original value, which is 514,000$ (450,000 * 0.512).

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. While Bob is offering a slightly better deal, I'm still not getting the majority of the money. I'll reject it.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 27.1% less than in the previous round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 630000,
  ""bob_gain"": 370000,
  ""message"": ""I'm starting to think you're not serious about finding a deal""
}
```

I'm offering Bob the same amount as before, 370,000$, and keeping 630,000$ for myself. I'm not sure if Bob is just bluffing or not, but I'm sticking to my previous offer."

My gain of 500,000$ is worth 59.05% of its original value, which is 590,500$ (500,000 * 0.5905).
Bob's gain of 500,000$ is worth 32.77% of its original value, which is 326,850$ (500,000 * 0.3277).
