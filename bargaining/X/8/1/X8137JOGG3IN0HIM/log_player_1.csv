Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was quite cheeky! Let's be realistic. How about a 70/30 split in my favor?  It's still a good deal considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
