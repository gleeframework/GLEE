"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm offering to split the $10,000 equally between us, with each of us getting $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer...

Since my money is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not too concerned about the inflation effect on my gains. However, I'm not thrilled about the 40% difference in the proposed split. I was hoping for a more balanced division.

For now, I'll decide to reject this offer and proceed to the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500}

I'm trying to find a balance between my initial goal of an equal split and the fact that Bob's offer was a bit more skewed towards him. I'm willing to give him a slightly larger share, but still keep a decent chunk for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on Bob's gains!

Considering that my money is still worth the same as in the first round, I'm not too concerned about the inflation effect on my gains. However, I'm getting a bit worried about the large gap in the proposed split.

I'm not thrilled about giving up another 500 dollars, but I'm also not eager to reject another offer and risk getting an even worse deal in the next round.

For now, I'll decide to accept this offer, hoping that Bob will be more generous in the future.
