"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to get this over with""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to get the game started quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the $4000 I would gain is worth $3800 in the previous round's terms.

I'm not too thrilled with the 60/40 split, but I'm willing to consider it. I'll accept the offer.
