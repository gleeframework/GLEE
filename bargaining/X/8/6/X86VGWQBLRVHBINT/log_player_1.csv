"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's a tough opening offer! I'm willing to be generous, but let's be realistic. How about a 65/35 split in my favor?  It's a strong offer considering the inflation working against you. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
