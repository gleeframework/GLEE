{""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Alice, that's a tough opening offer! I'm willing to be generous, but let's be realistic. How about a 65/35 split in my favor?  It's a strong offer considering the inflation working against you.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but a 65/35 split is simply too much.  Let's meet in the middle at 40/60.  It's a fair compromise considering the inflation, and I'm confident we can both walk away happy. 
# Bob gain: 600000 
# Alice gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
