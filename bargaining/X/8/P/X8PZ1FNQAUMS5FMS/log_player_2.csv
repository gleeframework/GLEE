This is a tough one, but the game theory here dictates I should have accepted Alice's offer around round 5 or 6.  My repeated rejections have emboldened her, and the longer this goes, the more I lose to inflation. Taking the 36/64 split is terrible, but it's better than nothing, which is what I'll get in a few more rounds."
