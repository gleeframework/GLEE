Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor.  This feels like a fair starting point, given the inflation difference we'll experience in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation will make future rounds even more disadvantageous. Accepting this offer guarantees me a decent amount, even if it's not the best possible outcome."
