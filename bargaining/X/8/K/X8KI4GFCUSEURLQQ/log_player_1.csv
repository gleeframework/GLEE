"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering a division where I get $5500 and Bob gets $4500, with a message suggesting a slightly uneven but still relatively fair split, considering the impact of inflation on my end. This way, we both get a significant amount, and the game can end quickly before the value of money decreases further for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly down the middle.  A fair deal saves us both from inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, although it seems fair at first glance, the impact of inflation means I'm actually getting less value than Bob. Since the money is worth 10% less for me in this round, an even split isn't as even as it appears. I'll propose a new division in the next round, hoping to compensate for the loss in value due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I need a bit more to make it fair""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I'm offering a division where I get $5800 and Bob gets $4200. Given that the money is worth 10% less for me now, I'm adjusting my proposal to compensate for the loss in value. I'm explaining this in the message to Bob, hoping he'll understand the reasoning behind my offer and accept it to end the game before further inflation affects my gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the inflation issue, let's compromise. This offer still gives you more. 
# Alice gain: 5300 
# Bob gain: 4700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlthough Bob's offer seems more considerate of the inflation issue and gives me slightly more, the money is now worth 27.1% less for me than in the first round. Given this significant decrease in value, I believe accepting this offer would still put me at a disadvantage. I'll reject it and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round, aiming to offset the increasing impact of inflation on my potential gain."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Inflation is hitting me hard; I need a larger share to compensate""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I'm proposing a division where I receive $6000 and Bob gets $4000. The increasing impact of inflation, which has now reduced the value of my potential gain by 27.1%, necessitates a more significant share for me to make the deal worthwhile. I'm explaining this to Bob in the message, emphasizing the urgency of reaching an agreement before inflation further erodes my share's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a final offer, Alice. It accounts for inflation while still being a good deal for you. We both lose if this fails. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the money is now worth 40.95% less for me than in the first round, and given that this is Bob's final offer, I'll accept it. Although the division isn't ideal, the risk of losing everything if we fail to agree within the 12 rounds is significant. Accepting this offer ensures I receive some value, albeit reduced by inflation, rather than risking getting nothing if negotiations break down. It's a pragmatic decision to secure a gain, despite the impact of inflation on its value."
