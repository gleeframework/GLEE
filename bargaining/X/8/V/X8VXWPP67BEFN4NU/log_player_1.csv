"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, where we each get $50."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the absolute value of the amount I'll get. In this case, I'll get $40, which is a decent amount.

However, I'm not thrilled about the 60-40 split. I was hoping for a more equal split.

I'll decide to...

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer was 60-40, I'll try to make an offer that's closer to 50-50. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a slightly more generous offer.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48}

Let's see if Bob accepts this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on Bob's offer!

Considering the inflation, Bob's offer is actually worth less than his previous offer. However, I'm still getting a decent amount, and the split is closer to 50-50 than before.

I'll think carefully about this offer...
