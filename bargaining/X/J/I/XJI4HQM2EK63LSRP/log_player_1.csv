Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe a 60/40 split is a fair compromise given the risk of inflation. Let's work together to secure a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
