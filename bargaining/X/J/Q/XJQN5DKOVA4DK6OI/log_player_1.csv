"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 40% and take 60%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, you can have a small share 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure's on!

After considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think taking only 25% of the remaining amount is a fair share, especially considering the inflation rate. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. I'll take 42% and give you 58%. This is a fair split considering the current value of the money.""
}
```

I've adjusted my offer to account for the inflation and tried to find a more balanced split. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slight majority, but I'm willing to give you a decent share 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The offers keep getting more aggressive!

After considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 40-60 split, especially since the money's value is decreasing rapidly due to inflation. I'll try to negotiate for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise again. I'll take 45% and give you 55%. Let's try to find a mutually beneficial solution before the money loses more value.""
}
```

I've adjusted my offer to account for the increased inflation and tried to find a more balanced split. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
