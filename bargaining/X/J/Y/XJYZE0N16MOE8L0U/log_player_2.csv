Let's see if I can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'll propose a more even split. Let's see if Alice agrees."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I would prefer a more even split, it's better to accept this offer. With inflation, each round will make my potential gains smaller. This offer is close to my initial goal, and I don't want to risk getting a worse deal."
