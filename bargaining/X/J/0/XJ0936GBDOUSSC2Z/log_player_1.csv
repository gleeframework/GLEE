Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money! With the offer being worth 14.26% less than the original, I'm going to have to think carefully about this one.

I'm not thrilled with the offer, but I'm also not sure if I can do better. After some thought, I've decided to {""decision"": ""accept""} this offer. It's not ideal, but it's better than going to the next round and risking even more erosion of the value of the money."
