"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and I hope Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A bit more for me, but still a good start! 
# Alice gain: 25 
# Bob gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it.

Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll think about the value of the money Bob gains. With the 10% decrease in value, Bob's 75% gain would be equivalent to 67.5% of the initial $100.

I'm willing to accept this offer, but I'll make a mental note to aim for a better split in the next round.
