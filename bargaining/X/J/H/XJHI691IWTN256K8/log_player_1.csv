Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm offering Bob a small share to start, knowing he'll get a much smaller share in the later rounds due to the inflation. I'm hoping this will make him accept the offer in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, I'm aware that the value of the money will continue to decrease for Bob. Accepting this offer will ensure I receive at least half of the remaining value, and avoid the risk of getting nothing if we reach the 12th round."
