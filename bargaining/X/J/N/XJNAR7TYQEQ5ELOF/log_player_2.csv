"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer heavily favors Alice. While an even split might seem fair, the inflation dynamic means Bob will benefit more from a delayed agreement."

# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is taking advantage of the situation but not offering a significant enough concession to justify the losses due to inflation.  Bob needs to hold out for a better deal."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm still not convinced. Meet me in the middle of our last offers 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is a tough one, and getting close to crunch time. However, Alice is clearly trying to manipulate Bob by calling his bluff on the ""final offer.""  While the current offer is slightly better, accepting now might signal that Bob is getting desperate. He needs to hold strong a bit longer."

Round 6

# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is incredibly frustrating, but Alice is clearly trying to wear Bob down.  It's a dangerous game, as they're both getting very close to losing a significant amount of money. Bob needs to hold his ground, the next offer is crucial."
