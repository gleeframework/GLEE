I'm starting with a pretty generous offer, giving Bob 10% of the money.  I want to see if he's willing to accept a quick deal, or if he's hoping to get more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse for me than my initial offer.  I'm going to reject and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway, but I'm still going to keep a larger share for myself.  I think this is a fair offer considering the inflation that's occurred."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still worse for me than my last offer. I'm going to reject again and see if I can negotiate a better deal in the next round. The inflation is hitting Bob harder than me, so I think I can still get a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}

I'm going to try to make one more concession. The inflation is getting to Bob, and he's going to need to accept a deal soon.  I'm offering him a 30% share, which is still more than what he offered me last round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000

{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still lower than what I've offered in the past. I'm going to reject and see if I can get a better deal in the next round.  The inflation is really hurting Bob now, and I think I can get closer to my desired split."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to try to make one more concession.  The inflation is starting to hit me harder now, but I still believe Bob needs to take a deal soon. I'm offering him a 20% share, which is a little better than his last offer, but I'm still getting the majority."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough choice.  Inflation is really hurting me now, and I'm worried that if I reject again, Bob might get even more greedy.  I'm going to accept this offer, even though it's not ideal."
