Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out. Let's split it closer to my offer from round 3. I think this is a fair deal considering inflation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate as the rounds progress and inflation eats into her potential gains.  While her offer is closer to her Round 3 proposal, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  I'm betting she'll be willing to make a much larger concession in the next round or two to avoid getting nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time. We're down to the wire here. I'll accept an even split to avoid both of us getting nothing.""} 

**Reasoning:**

It's getting risky. While I believe Alice is getting desperate, I need to acknowledge the possibility she's playing hardball. Offering a 50/50 split minimizes my risk. If she rejects this, there's a good chance she's willing to gamble on getting nothing at all."
