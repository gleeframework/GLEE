"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""
}
```

I'm offering to take $60 and give Bob $40, with a message that suggests I'm being somewhat generous, but also acknowledging that I'm taking a bit more. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a bit more in my favor this time 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 57,
  ""bob_gain"": 43,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""
}
```

I've reduced my initial offer to try to find a compromise with Bob. Since the money is worth less with each round, I'm trying to find a mutually acceptable solution before it's too late!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll lower my expectations a bit, but still want the bigger share 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Last chance before it's too late!""
}
```

I'm trying to nudge Bob a bit more, while also warning him that time is running out. The money is losing value fast, so I'm hoping he'll see sense and accept this offer!"
