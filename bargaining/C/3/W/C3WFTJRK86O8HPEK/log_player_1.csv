I'm starting with a very high offer for myself, but leaving a small amount for Bob. I want to see if he's willing to accept a tiny share right away, or if he'll risk the inflation to try and get more later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is a big improvement from the first round, but I still think I can get a better deal.  I'm going to reject and see if he'll offer me more in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
``` 

I'm raising my offer slightly, but still keeping a larger share. I'm hoping that the threat of inflation and the fact that I'm the one making the offer now will make Bob more likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 750000 
# Bob gain: 250000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm going to accept this offer. Inflation is hitting Bob harder than me, and while I could potentially get more in the future, the risk of getting nothing at all is too high. This is a good deal for me, considering how much the money has depreciated for Bob."
