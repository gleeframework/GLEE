"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a compromise""}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, where I get 60 dollars and Bob gets 40 dollars. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, we can both take half. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not convinced by Bob's offer. I think I can do better than a 50/50 split, especially considering the inflation has reduced the value of my potential gain. I'll reject this offer and wait for Bob's next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""A slight adjustment to account for inflation, let's try again""}

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, which is a slightly more favorable split for me considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation. I'm hoping Bob will consider this offer and accept it."
