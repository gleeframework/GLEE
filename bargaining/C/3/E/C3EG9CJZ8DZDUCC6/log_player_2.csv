Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think I deserve a bit more since I'm making a counteroffer and the money is losing value.""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, the money's shrinking fast. Let's just split it evenly and call it a day. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nSince the money is losing value rapidly, it's better to accept the offer and split the money evenly rather than risking further loss."
