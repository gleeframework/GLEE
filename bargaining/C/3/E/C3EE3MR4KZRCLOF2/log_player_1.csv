Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a more balanced approach, considering the decreasing value for you. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, time is literally money for me in this situation.  Let's be practical - I'll take a slight hit with $5,500, leaving you $4,500.  Deal?""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation is affecting you more, I'm willing to take a bit more. This is a fair offer given the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The value of waiting any longer is significantly diminished. While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 yields me $4000.  If I reject and go to Round 5, even if I could secure the entire $10,000 (highly unlikely), the inflation would erode its value substantially. It's better to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $4,000 now."
