"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn to decide.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable given that we have a long way to go before the 12th round. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice. A 50/50 split seems like the most sensible option to me. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 5% inflation, my gain of $5000 is now worth 95% of what it was in the first round. Still, I'm not sure I'm comfortable with a 50-50 split, especially since I'm the one who made the first offer. I'll try to negotiate a bit more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure a 50-50 split is the best I can do, Bob. Can you offer a bit more?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my gain of $5000 is now worth 95% of 95% = 90.25% of the original value. I'll take that into account when making my next offer.

Here's my next proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. But I need a bit more to make it worth my while.""
}
```"
