"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn to decide. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm Bob, and I'm going to try to get a better deal.  I know I have 12 rounds and the money is losing value, so I'll be careful.  I'll see if I can get a more even split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, Alice. A 50/50 split seems like the most sensible option to me.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob. But I need a bit more to make it worth my while. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice's offer is getting closer to what I was hoping for, and with the inflation, it's not worth risking losing even more. I'll accept this offer."
