"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but still a fair deal! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting Bob's gain, I need to take that into account. Since Bob's gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

In the first round, a 50/50 split would have given me $5000. Now, Bob is offering me $4000, which is worth 5% less than the $5000 I would have gotten in the first round. So, in terms of purchasing power, I'm actually getting a slightly better deal than the initial 50/50 split.

However, Bob is taking a bigger share, which might be a sign that he's trying to take advantage of the inflation. I'll have to think carefully about this.

After considering the offer, I decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a bit aggressive, I'll try to make a counteroffer that takes into account the inflation. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly bigger share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly bigger share than I would have in a 50/50 split, but I'm still trying to protect my own interests. Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bigger share now! 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob is really pushing for a bigger share! With the inflation affecting Bob's gain, I need to think carefully about this offer.

In the first round, a 50/50 split would have given me $5000. Now, Bob is offering me $3500, which is worth 29.5% less than the $5000 I would have gotten in the first round. Considering the inflation, this is a significant reduction in purchasing power.

However, I also need to consider the fact that Bob is taking a bigger share, and the offer is still a compromise. I'm not sure if I want to give him that much more of the pie.

After weighing the options, I decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was quite aggressive, I'll try to make a counteroffer that takes into account the inflation and my own interests. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bigger share, but I need to protect my own interests too!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly bigger share than before, but I'm not giving him the entire pie. I'm trying to find a balance between being generous and protecting my own interests. Let's see how Bob reacts!"
