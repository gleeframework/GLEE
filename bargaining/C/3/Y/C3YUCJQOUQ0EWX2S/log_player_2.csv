"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90%, you get 10%. We can work something out in later rounds. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible offer! While Alice is losing money to inflation, I'm losing out on even more by accepting such a small share. I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Let's be realistic, Alice. I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor. Take it while it's still a good deal for you.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but 70/30 is too much. Let's try 60/40 this time. We both have to be reasonable. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is coming around, but it's still early.  I need to push for a better split.  Inflation is working against her, so I'm willing to gamble on another round."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Okay, Alice, I'll meet you halfway. 65/35. Time is running out, and this is a fair deal considering the circumstances.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still willing to negotiate, but 65/35 is too much. Let's try 55/45. We are getting closer to a solution. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This is getting interesting! Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of inflation.  While 55/45 is better than my starting point, I think I can squeeze out a bit more.  Let's see how much she's willing to concede in the next round."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 620000,
""alice_gain"": 380000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be done with this.  62/38, my final offer.  Take it before inflation eats away at your share even more.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to split the money evenly at this point. Let's be fair, and end this negotiation. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

A 50/50 split is a fair deal at this stage.  While I could potentially squeeze out a bit more, there's a real risk that Alice will hold out for a better deal in later rounds.  It's better to secure a guaranteed win now than risk losing everything to time and inflation."
