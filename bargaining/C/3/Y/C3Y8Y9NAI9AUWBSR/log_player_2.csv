I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  I figure Alice will accept this since she lost out on a better deal last round."

I'm going for a 70/30 split this time.  The inflation is starting to bite, so I need to secure a larger portion."

I'm starting to feel the pressure of the decreasing value of the money, so I'll take this offer. It's not ideal, but it's better than getting nothing!"
