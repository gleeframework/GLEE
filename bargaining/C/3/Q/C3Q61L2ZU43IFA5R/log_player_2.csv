"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's important to remember the inflation factor.  Rejecting and making a counter-offer will give Bob more leverage in the next round, potentially earning him a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I think a more balanced split is fair, considering the upcoming rounds and the inflation impact on both of us.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, let's meet in the middle 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

Alice's offer is a good compromise considering the inflation factor. Accepting this offer secures Bob a decent share of the money while avoiding the risk of further inflation and potential losses in future rounds."
