"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 400k, you can't do better than that!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000 and keeping 600,000 for myself. I'm confident that this is a generous offer, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can't beat this, it's a fair deal! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this new offer. Considering the inflation, I'm not as well off as I was in the first round, and Bob's offer seems quite generous.

However, I'm not convinced that this is the best deal for me. I'll reject this offer and try to do better in the next round.

```

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation taking its toll, I need to be more aggressive in my offer. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting desperate, take it or leave it!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not desperate, I'll do better! 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking its toll, and my gains are decreasing rapidly. However, I'm not convinced that Bob's offer is the best I can get.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further. I need to think strategically about how to maximize my gains in the face of inflation.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really biting now. I need to be more aggressive in my offer to make up for the loss in value. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 490000,
  ""bob_gain"": 510000,
  ""message"": ""This is my final offer, take it or leave it!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take it to the limit, one more try! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll on my potential gains. However, I've been trying to be aggressive and negotiate for a better deal, but it seems like Bob is not budging.

Considering the significant decrease in value due to inflation, I think I should accept this offer. I'm not sure if I can do better, and the risk of Bob making an even worse offer in the next round is too high.
