"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  This is a pretty aggressive offer, but I figure I can get away with it in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'm not thrilled with the 10/90 split, it's better than nothing.  Since the money is worth 5% less this round, I'm taking what I can get!"
