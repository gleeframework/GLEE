Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This is a classic game theory scenario! I'm starting with a very aggressive offer, hoping Bob will accept it. If he doesn't, I'll adjust my strategy in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer more money, this is a fair offer. Considering the inflation, I'm likely to get a worse deal in the next round.  It's better to secure a decent amount now."
