5700.0,4300.0,"Okay, Bob, let's meet somewhere in the middle. I'm willing to come down a bit, but the split needs to reflect the faster rate of inflation for me. I propose $5,700 for me and $4,300 for you.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4800.0,5200.0,"Alice, we need to find a compromise soon. I'm proposing a 52/48 split. It's closer to your offer, but still acknowledges that we both lose with each passing round.",Bob,4,

5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, we're running out of time! My offer is now $5,500 for me and $4,500 for you.  This is a fair deal considering the rapid inflation working against me. Let's close this out!",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  We're both losing money due to inflation.  Let's be practical and split it 50/50 before we get nothing.",Bob,6,
