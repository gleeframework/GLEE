Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split this more evenly.  I'm taking a bit more this round since inflation will eat away at my share next round.  I'm hoping we can find a fair split that works for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000
