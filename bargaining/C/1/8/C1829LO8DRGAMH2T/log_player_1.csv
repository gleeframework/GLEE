"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new offer, I'll have to adjust my calculation considering the inflation.

Since the money is worth 20% less for me, I'll have 80% of the value of the money I would have gained in Round 1. So, 80% of $6,000 is $4,800.

Now, considering Bob's offer for Round 2, I'll have $5,000 and Bob will have $5,000. This is actually better for me than my original offer, since I would have had $6,000 in the first scenario, but it's worth 20% less due to inflation.

So, I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 2.
