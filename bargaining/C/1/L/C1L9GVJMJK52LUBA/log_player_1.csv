Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,

}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the $100 and Bob gets 20%."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

I'll think about Bob's offer for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I don't think an even split is fair, considering the inflation rates. I'd like to propose a new offer."
