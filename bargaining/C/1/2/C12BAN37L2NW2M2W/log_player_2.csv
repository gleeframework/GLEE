"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Alice, I'll make a counteroffer to Alice.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation rates, the effective amounts are:

* Alice's offer: Bob gets 4000 / 0.84 = 4762.86 (in original terms), Alice gets 6000 / 0.81 = 7408.64

I'll accept Alice's offer from round 3.
