"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to negotiate if you want more.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the money and Bob gets 20%. This is a relatively fair split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I want more! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $100,000 is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $80,000.

I'm not willing to accept this offer. I think Bob is being too greedy, and I'd like to make a counteroffer. 

I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""You're being too aggressive. I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not going to give you the majority.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60% split, which is a bit more in my favor, but still a reasonable compromise. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too stingy, I want a significant share! 
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $60,000 in the third round is now worth 51.2% of its original value, which is $30,720.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'm not willing to accept this extremely lopsided split. I'd be giving up a significant amount of value, and I'm not convinced Bob is willing to compromise.

I'll reject this offer.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up control. This is my final compromise.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55% split, which is a bit more in my favor, but still a reasonable compromise. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking a risk, but I think I can do better than this! 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $550,000 in the fifth round is now worth 32.77% of its original value, which is $179,115.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'm shocked by how low my proposed gain is. $1,000 is a tiny fraction of the original $1,000,000, and it's not even worth considering. I'm not going to accept this offer.

I'll reject this offer.

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""bob_gain"": 600000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not going to give up. I'll meet you halfway, but that's as low as I'll go.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 40% split, which is a significant concession from my previous offers. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finally end the game."
