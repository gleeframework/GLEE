"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

I propose to take 999,000 and leave Bob with 1,000.  Since I'm the first to propose, I'm being very generous.  This way, Bob can see that I'm open to a fair division, even if slightly biased towards myself. Hopefully, this will make him more likely to accept in the future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is proposing a more even split, which is tempting. However, I'm still the one who is losing money due to inflation. I need to see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob 200,000, hoping to leverage the fact that he's losing value on his end.  This is still a pretty good deal for him, considering he's losing value with each round.  Let's see if he'll take it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting increasingly better for him, I'm still losing nothing due to inflation.  I need to see if I can squeeze out a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to slightly decrease my offer, aiming for 700,000 for myself.  This is still a very generous offer, considering the inflation that Bob is facing.  My goal is to strike a balance between securing a good deal for myself while also being reasonable enough to avoid further rejections."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is the best deal I've gotten so far.  While I'd prefer more, the inflation is eating away at Bob's share, and he's getting increasingly more desperate for a deal.  I'll take what I can get."
