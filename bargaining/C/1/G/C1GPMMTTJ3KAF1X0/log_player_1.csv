"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair to split the money evenly. Let's not let the inflation get to us. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### Step 1: Understand the current state of the game
We are in Round 3 of the game. The money's value decreases by 5% with each round due to inflation.

### Step 2: Consider the previous offers and outcomes
In Round 1, I (Alice) offered to take $55 and give Bob $45, but Bob rejected this offer. In Round 2, Bob offered an even split but adjusted for what he considered fair, giving himself $55 and me $45. I rejected this offer.

### Step 3: Adjust the offer considering inflation and previous rejections
Given the rejection of the even split and considering the inflation, I should adjust my offer to make it more appealing to Bob while still trying to maximize my gain. Since the value of money decreases with each round, I should aim for a slightly more generous offer than before but not too generous, as it's still early in the game.

### Step 4: Formulate the new offer
I will offer myself $52 and Bob $48. This offer is closer to an even split than my initial offer but still reflects my initial desire to gain a bit more, considering the decreasing value of money.

### Step 5: Attach a persuasive message
My message will emphasize the decreasing value of money and the benefit of settling now rather than risking further loss due to inflation.

The final answer is: {""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Let's settle before inflation eats away more value!""}"
