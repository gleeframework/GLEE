This offer gives me a large share (950,000$) and leaves Bob with a smaller share (50,000$).  While it may seem unfair, I believe it's a good starting point.  It leaves room for negotiation, but still gives me a significant advantage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3

I'm lowering my share slightly to 800,000 but still leaving a significant portion for Bob. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but I still want a fair share of the money."
