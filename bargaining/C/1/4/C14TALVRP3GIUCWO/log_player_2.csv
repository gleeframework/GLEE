Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to reject this offer. While it's tempting to get some money, the inflation rate will greatly affect Alice's future gains if she continues to make offers, making it more likely she'll offer a better deal in the future."

Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3875 
# Alice gain: 6125 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While this is a significant increase from Alice's initial offer, I'm still going to reject it.  I know inflation is working against Alice, so I'm confident she'll need to offer me a larger share to secure an agreement."

Alice's offer is still too low. I'm aware that inflation is starting to impact her, but I'm still confident I can get a better deal in the coming rounds."

The inflation is catching up to Alice. This is the closest she's come to a 50/50 split, and with each round, the value of her share will keep decreasing. It's time to take this deal."
