"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not accepting this offer. I think I can get a better deal in the next round, considering the inflation will affect Alice's gain more than mine. Let's see what happens next!"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that's a bit more favorable to me, considering the inflation factor. Here it is:

""message"": ""Considering the inflation, this is a more reasonable split. You won't get a better deal if we wait!""}"

# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI still think I can get a better deal. Since the inflation is affecting Alice's gain more and more, I'll reject this offer and try to get a better one in the next round.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","With the inflation affecting Alice's gain even more, I'll try to make an offer that's more favorable to me while still being reasonable for Alice. Here it is:

""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Considering the significant inflation impact on your gain, this is a generous offer. Take it before it's too late!""}"
