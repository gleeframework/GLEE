"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I'm offering a 90/10 split in my favor. I figure a big initial offer will encourage Bob to accept and avoid the risk of inflation, especially since he'll lose a much larger percentage of value than me if we go to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 890000 
# Bob gain: 110000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is slightly better for me than my initial proposal, but I'm still losing a significant amount of value due to inflation. I believe I can do better by holding out and making a counter-proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 950000, ""bob_gain"": 50000}
```

I'm increasing my share to 95% and lowering Bob's share to 5%.  While my offer is worse for me than Bob's offer in round 2, it's a significant increase from round 1, and the inflation rate is still working in my favor. Hopefully, this will be enough to tempt Bob into accepting."
