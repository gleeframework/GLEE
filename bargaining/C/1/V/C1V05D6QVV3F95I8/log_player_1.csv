Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a very generous offer to Bob. I'll take the majority of the money, but I want to see if Bob is willing to cooperate early on.  This will also allow me to see if he seems particularly risk-averse."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While I'm getting less than I initially proposed, it's still a decent amount of money, and I'm not sure I'll get a better deal in future rounds due to inflation."
