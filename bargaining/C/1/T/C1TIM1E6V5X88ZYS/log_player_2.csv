"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to reject this offer.  While it's tempting, I know that Alice has all the power here.  She can keep offering me a small amount, knowing that the value of the money will decrease each round.  I'll try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000}
```

I'm proposing a more even split.  While Alice still gets the majority, this offers me a decent share and hopefully, she'll be more willing to accept it before the value of the money drops too much for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice is still being pretty stubborn. I'll keep rejecting these offers. I need to get a better deal before the inflation completely devalues my share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500}
```

I'm increasing my offer again.  While I'm still losing out, I'm trying to show Alice that I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping she'll see the value in getting this deal done before the inflation hits harder."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500

{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offers are becoming more and more insulting. The inflation is really starting to hurt, but I need to hold out for a better deal. I can't let her dictate the terms while the value of my share plummets.  I'll continue to reject her offers and push for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm proposing an even split.  The inflation is really starting to hit hard now, and I think Alice might be more receptive to a fair deal.  I'm willing to give up a little more to get this done before the money becomes completely worthless for me."
