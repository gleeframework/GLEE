"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

This is a good starting point. While the offer is tempting, it's important to consider the inflation factor. Let's see what Alice offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}
``` 
Let's start with a fair split.  This ensures we both get a substantial amount, before the inflation kicks in."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice is still offering a very uneven split, and while the inflation is a factor, it's not enough to make this offer worthwhile. I'm going to stick to my idea of a fair split and hope she sees the value in it."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}
``` 

I'm going to increase my share slightly, acknowledging the inflation, but still offering Alice a significant amount. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that allows us both to maximize our gains."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice is now offering more than half the money to herself. While I understand the effects of inflation, this is a significant shift in the balance of power. I'm going to stick to my fair split approach, hoping she realizes the value of a balanced solution before it's too late."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000}
``` 

Inflation is hitting hard, so I'm going to increase my share a bit more. However, I still want to be fair and offer Alice a reasonable amount.  This is our last chance to get a good deal before things get even worse."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Alice's offer is finally moving towards a more balanced split. While I'd still prefer a larger share, the inflation is drastically reducing the value of the money for Alice.  Accepting this offer is the best way to ensure we both get something before it's too late."
