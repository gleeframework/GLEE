"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to begin with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slight edge, but I'm open to negotiation.  Let's see if we can find a win-win. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain is now worth 95% of the original amount, so I'd be getting $475,000.

I'm not thrilled about the 55-45 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to negotiate further, but I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this split. Can we try to get closer to 50-50?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my potential gain is now worth 90.25% of the original amount, so I'd be getting $900,250.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to take a slightly larger share to make up for the lost value due to inflation.""
}
