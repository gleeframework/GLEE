Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going for a relatively high share in the first round.  Since we have 12 rounds, I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to accept quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While it's a bit disappointing to get less than my initial proposal, it's a fair split and I'm wary of further rounds of negotiation.  The inflation is going to affect me more than Bob in the long run."
