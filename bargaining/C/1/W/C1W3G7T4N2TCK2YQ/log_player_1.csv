"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

This is a 50/50 split, which seems fair and reasonable for the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the previous round, so I'm looking for a better deal.

I reject Bob's offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the previous round, I'll try to make a more favorable offer.

Here's my offer for round 3:

```
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

I'm offering a slightly more favorable split in my favor, but still a reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are starting to add up!

Considering that the money I gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I'm in a tough spot. However, Bob's offer is still a bit more in his favor than in the previous round.

I'll think carefully before making a decision...
