"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
 
I propose that I get $9000 and Bob gets $1000. I believe this is a fair offer, as it gives me the majority of the money while still giving Bob a small portion. I'm hoping he'll accept, as we both get something and avoid the risk of inflation in the next rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
Even though I'm getting less than my initial proposal, accepting this offer ensures I get something and avoids the risk of further inflation.  A 50/50 split is a fair outcome considering the changing value of the money."
