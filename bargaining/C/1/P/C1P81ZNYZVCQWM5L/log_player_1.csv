"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, it's a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $10,000, which is $4,000, and keeping $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, let's compromise! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 5% inflation, my gain of $2,000 is now worth 95% of its original value, which is $1,900.

I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I think it's a decent compromise. I'll accept the offer.
