"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, giving Bob a 40% share of the initial $1,000,000. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, which is a reasonable proposal. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider this offer carefully.

I accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
