**Reasoning:**

Alice is stubbornly sticking close to her initial split, seemingly not factoring in the significant inflation.  While her offer is slightly better, it's not enough. We're past the halfway point in the rounds, and the value will plummet soon.  I'm betting she'll be more reasonable when she sees I'm serious about walking away."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""This is it. A straight 50/50 split. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

The time for games is over.  Offering anything less than an even split at this point is too risky. Alice might be hoping I'll panic and accept a bad deal as the rounds dwindle, but a 50/50 split is the fairest outcome. This puts the pressure on her to accept a reasonable deal before the money dwindles even further."
