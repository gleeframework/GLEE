"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn to respond!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor, with me getting $70 and Bob getting $30. This is a relatively fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
