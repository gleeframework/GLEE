Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a very simple offer. I'm confident I can get a better deal later on, but I want to see how Bob reacts and how the inflation plays out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a good deal for me, even with the inflation. I'm getting a good chunk of the money, and Bob is getting less than he wanted in the first round. I don't want to risk him rejecting this and going to the next round where I'd have to offer him even more."
