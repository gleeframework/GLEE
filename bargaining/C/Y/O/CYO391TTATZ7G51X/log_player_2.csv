"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This seems like a reasonable split to me. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think a more even split is fair, given the potential for inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer.  Take it or leave it, but consider the money is losing value quickly for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 3600 
# Alice gain: 6400 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While the offer is less than I originally hoped for, the inflation makes it increasingly likely that future offers will be worse.  It's better to take what I can now."
