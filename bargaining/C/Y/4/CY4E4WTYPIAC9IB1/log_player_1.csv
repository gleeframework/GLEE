"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I think this is a good starting point.""}

I'm proposing a 60:40 split, which seems reasonable to me. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll match your fairness, let's see if you'll accept 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 50:50 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Since Bob's offer is more generous than the original 40:60 split I proposed, I'll accept this offer.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
