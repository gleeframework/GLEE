"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $100,000 and keep the rest.""
}
```

This offer gives me 90% of the initial amount, and Bob gets 10%. The message is a friendly one, inviting Bob to accept the offer and end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle and split it evenly 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll need to adjust my thinking.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

This way, we both get an equal share, and the game ends."
