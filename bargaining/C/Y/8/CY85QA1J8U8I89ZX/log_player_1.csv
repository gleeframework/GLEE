"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point""}

I'm proposing a 60:40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can wrap up the game early!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better. This seems like a more balanced split, considering the inflation rates. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 40:60 split, but I understand Bob's point about considering the inflation rates.

I'll decide to...

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm hoping to get a better deal, and I'm willing to negotiate further!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, let's meet in the middle and split it 50/50""}

I'm trying to find a more balanced split, taking into account the inflation rates and Bob's concerns. I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to him!"
