"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems fair and gives us both a decent amount of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, I'll actually get $570,000, and Bob will get $980,000.

Considering the large difference in the proposed split, I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer or reject it and try to negotiate a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the inflation taking its toll, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money.

Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems like a fair and balanced deal, considering the decreasing value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rate accelerating, the money is losing value rapidly. In this round, I'll get $430,000 and Bob will get $720,000.

Considering the large disparity in the proposed split, I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer or try to negotiate a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","The inflation is getting out of control! With the money losing value so rapidly, I'll have to be more aggressive in my offer.

Here's my next proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}

I'm taking a risk by offering Bob a smaller share, but I'm hoping that the rapidly decreasing value of the money will make this offer more appealing to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money. In this round, I'll get $308,000 and Bob will get $440,000.

Considering the rapidly decreasing value of the money, I think this offer is actually a decent one. It's a 40-60 split, which is similar to my initial offer, but with a much lower total value.
