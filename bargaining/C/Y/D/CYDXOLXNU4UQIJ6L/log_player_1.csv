"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a fair and straightforward offer. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'll still give you a decent share 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Not a great start to the negotiations!

I'll think about it for a moment...

I don't think I want to accept an offer that gives me only 40% of the money. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal. So, I'll reject Bob's offer.

```

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer that's a bit more aggressive than the first one, but still reasonable.

  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more.""

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I still think I deserve the majority

# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to squeeze me out!

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I don't want to risk going to another round either. I'll think about it...

Hmm... 45% of $100 is $45, which is a decent amount, but I was hoping for more. I'm not sure if I should push for a better deal or accept this one.

Let's see...
