Bob is stalling and trying to pressure me with the deadline. I'm not going to settle for less than what I offered in round 3."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this back and forth is pointless.  I'm giving you a chance to take a good amount before inflation eats away at it further. Don't be greedy! 
# Alice gain: 490000 
# Bob gain: 510000

This is getting too risky now. While I'd prefer a slightly better split, accepting this offer guarantees I get something before inflation eats away at the value even further."
