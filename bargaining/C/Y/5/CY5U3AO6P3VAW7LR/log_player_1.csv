"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000, ""message"": ""Let's start fair. I get the majority but you still get something.  What do you think?""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, I get a bit more since the money is worth less to you now 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a larger share due to the inflation. This is my final offer.""}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm willing to take a risk. The money is worth even less to you now, so I'm taking a bigger share 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

At this point, accepting is the best option. The inflation has significantly devalued Alice's potential gains. While the offer is not ideal, it's better than risking further devaluation in the next round."
