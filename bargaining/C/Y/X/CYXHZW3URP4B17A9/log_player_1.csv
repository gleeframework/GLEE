  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a more reasonable split, considering the potential for inflation to erode the value of the money over time. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
