Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose to take $990,000 and give Bob $10,000. This leaves a large amount for me, while still offering something to Bob.  Since the money will be worth less to him each round, I think he'll be motivated to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I would prefer more,  it's likely Bob will continue to offer a 50/50 split, and the inflation will hurt me more than it hurts him in the long run.  Accepting now ensures I get at least something."
