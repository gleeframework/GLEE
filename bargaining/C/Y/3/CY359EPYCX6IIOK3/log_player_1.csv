"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial amount, which is a relatively generous offer, considering the game is just starting and we both have the same information."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is a bit more aggressive than mine, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll think about it in terms of the original amount.

```
# Alice gain: 4500 / 0.9 = 5000
# Bob gain: 5500 / 0.9 = 6111.11
```

I'll reject this offer. I'd rather wait for a better deal.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer, I'll make a slightly more aggressive offer this time. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

This offer is a bit more favorable to me, but still leaves Bob with a decent share of the money."
