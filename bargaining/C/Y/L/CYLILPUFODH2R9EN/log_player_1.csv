"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a 90/10 split in my favor. This should leave room for negotiation, but it's a fair starting point considering I'm the one proposing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While the offer is tempting, it's still not a fair split considering the inflation. I'll reject this offer and see what Bob proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway with a 60/40 split. This is a more even distribution considering the inflation factor. I'm hoping this is a fair offer that Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation has significantly impacted the value of the money. This offer is closer to a 50/50 split after accounting for inflation, so I will accept it."
