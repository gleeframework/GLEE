Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. 60/40 is fair. Let's split the money and move on.

# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

Alice is offering the split I wanted last round.  It's worth slightly less now due to inflation, but it's still a good deal.  Better to take it than risk getting nothing."
