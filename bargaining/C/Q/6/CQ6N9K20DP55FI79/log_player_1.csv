Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation affects you more, I think this is a fair split. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. I rejected your offer because it heavily favored you. I am offering a 50/50 split now, but the longer this takes, the less appealing this will become for me. Let's end this.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your urgency, but I believe I can get a better deal. This is my new offer. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the situation. While he acknowledges my urgency (due to inflation), he's still pushing for a deal heavily in his favor.  I need to remain firm and show him I'm willing to risk further inflation to get a fair deal."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""bob_gain"": 5200,
""message"": ""Bob, this is my final offer. It's clear you're trying to maximize your gain, but I need you to understand the time pressure of this inflation. This is a reasonable split considering the circumstances. If you refuse, I'm prepared to gamble on a better outcome in later rounds.""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

I'm applying more pressure this round. I'm slightly lowering my demand, recognizing that I need to make some concessions due to the inflation. However, I'm making it clear this is my final offer and I'm willing to walk away and risk further inflation if he doesn't accept.  This conveys both flexibility and firmness, hopefully pushing Bob to accept."
