Round 2

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I understand the impact of inflation, but your initial offer was too low. Let's find a fairer middle ground.""}

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're both losing money with each round. I'm willing to meet in the middle, but it has to be a fair split considering the inflation rate is hitting me harder. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
