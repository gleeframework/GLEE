"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good deal!""} \n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split, where I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable and fair offer, considering we're both trying to maximize our gains. The message is a gentle nudge to persuade Bob to accept this offer and end the game early, avoiding further inflation. Fingers crossed!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55-45 split is more fair, considering we both have to agree.  What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} \n\nI've decided to reject Bob's offer of a 55-45 split. Although the offer seems reasonable, I believe I can negotiate for a better deal, considering we still have 10 rounds left. With each passing round, the money's value decreases, but I'm willing to take that risk to potentially increase my share. Let's see how Bob reacts in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 58-42 is a good compromise!""} \n\nI'm offering a 58-42 split, where I get $5,800 and Bob gets $4,200. Considering Bob's previous offer was a 55-45 split, I'm trying to find a middle ground that we can both agree on. The message is an attempt to persuade Bob that this is a fair compromise, taking into account our previous offers. Hopefully, Bob will see the reason in this proposal and accept it, ending the game before the money loses more value."
