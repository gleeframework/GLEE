"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started with a high offer, I'll try to counter 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's counteroffer is a significant reduction in my share.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not going to accept an 80-20 split. I'll try to negotiate further!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 10% less than in the first round due to inflation, my offer will be slightly lower than my initial one.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise, hoping Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm trying to get closer to the middle, but I still think I can do better 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to get closer to the middle, but still wants a slight edge.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think I'll accept this offer. It's not ideal, but it's a fair compromise, and I don't want to risk going to another round with the money being worth even less due to inflation."
