"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept to get something rather than risking going to the next round and facing further inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, Bob's offer is actually a decent one. I'm getting a smaller share than I initially proposed, but it's still a good compromise considering the reduced value of the money.

I accept Bob's offer.
