"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! I'm willing to give you a fair share, but I'm thinking I deserve more for my negotiation skills.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000. My message is a friendly one, but also a hint that I'm not willing to give up too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice.  An even split seems like the most reasonable way to start. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, so I'll have to adjust my thinking.

I'm not thrilled about the even split, but I don't want to risk going to the next round either. I'll accept Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
