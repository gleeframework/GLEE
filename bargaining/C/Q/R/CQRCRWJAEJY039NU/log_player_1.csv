"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $4,000, and I'll take $6,000. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'll be generous 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is quite generous, but I'm not sure I'm ready to give up so much yet. Considering the inflation effect, I'd rather not take the $3,000 now, as it's worth 20% less than the $4,000 I could have had in the first round.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```

# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to meet me in the middle, but I'm not sure I'm ready to give him an equal share just yet. Considering the inflation effect, the $5,000 I'd gain in this round is worth significantly less than the $6,000 I could have had in the first round.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.
