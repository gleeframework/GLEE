"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems like a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting Bob's gain, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since Bob's gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'm not sure if I should accept this offer.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob's offer was 10% lower than the original 50-50 split, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's a bit more favorable to myself. Here's my offer for round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which is a bit more skewed towards myself, but still relatively close to the original 50-50 split."

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Wow, Bob's offer is quite aggressive now! With the inflation affecting Bob's gain, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since Bob's gain is worth 27.1% less than the original 50-50 split, I'll need to consider whether this is a good opportunity to get a better deal.

However, I'm not sure if I want to give Bob such a large share of the money, especially considering the inflation. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering Bob's aggressive offer in round 4, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's more in my favor. Since Bob's gain is worth 27.1% less than the original 50-50 split, I'll aim to get a bit more than 50% of the remaining amount.

Here's my offer for round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a bit more skewed towards myself, but still relatively close to the original 50-50 split."

Round 6

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is really taking a toll on Bob's gain! With Bob's gain being worth 40.95% less than the original 50-50 split, I'm starting to think that I might be able to get a better deal.

However, I'm not sure if I want to give Bob 70% of the remaining amount, especially considering the inflation. I'll think about it for a moment...

After considering the offer, I'll reject it and try to negotiate further.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With Bob's gain being worth 40.95% less than the original 50-50 split, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's even more in my favor. Since I want to maximize my gain while minimizing Bob's, I'll aim to get as close to 75% of the remaining amount as possible.

Here's my offer for round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on Bob's gain now! With Bob's gain being worth 52.17% less than the original 50-50 split, I'm starting to think that I might be able to get an even better deal.

However, I'm not sure if I want to give Bob 60% of the remaining amount, especially considering the inflation. But at the same time, 400,000 is a significant amount, and I'm not sure if I can do better.

After considering the offer, I'll accept it.
