Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose that I take $999,999 and Bob receives $1.  This ensures that I get the vast majority of the money, and Bob still gets something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
