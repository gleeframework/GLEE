"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 3:1, a fair start? 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While Alice's proposal is a fair start, it's important to consider the inflation factor. Since Bob's money loses value at a slower rate than Alice's, he should aim to get a larger share in the hope of reaching a better deal in the future."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's aim for a more balanced split. I propose 60/40, recognizing the inflation advantage I have. It's a fair start, considering our different devaluation rates.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I'm not falling for it. I'll meet you in the middle this time. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, Alice's counter-offer is reasonable given the inflation and the fact that she has the power to reject my next offer. Accepting this offer guarantees a decent share and avoids risking a less favorable outcome in the next round."
