"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 3:1, a fair start?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $250,000 and keeping $750,000 for myself. I'm framing it as a fair split, but I'm hoping Bob will see the value in taking the smaller share and accepting my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's aim for a more balanced split. I propose 60/40, recognizing the inflation advantage I have. It's a fair start, considering our different devaluation rates. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation rates, Bob's proposal is actually more favorable to me than it initially seems. Since the money is worth 20% less for me, I'm effectively getting $400,000 worth 80% of its original value, which is equivalent to $320,000. Meanwhile, Bob is getting $600,000 worth 90% of its original value, which is equivalent to $540,000.

I'm not thrilled about the split, but I think I can do better next round. I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You're trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I'm not falling for it. I'll meet you in the middle this time.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a more balanced split, considering the inflation rates. I'm offering Bob $450,000, which is worth 45% of the original $1,000,000, and keeping $550,000, which is worth 55% of the original amount."
