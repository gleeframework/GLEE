"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor to start. It benefits us both to settle quickly due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's proposal seems ""fair"" at first glance, it's important to remember the inflation factor.  By rejecting, I can potentially secure a better deal for myself in the next round.  I'll be proposing and can leverage the fact that the money is worth less to Alice with each passing round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Let's try a 55/45 split.  While I value fairness, I also need to account for the inflation that impacts us both. This offer is a step towards a more balanced division.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a negotiation, and I'm willing to move a little.  58/42 acknowledges the inflation but still gives me a slight advantage for proposing first.  Time is ticking, let's settle this. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still heavily skewed in her favor, even considering inflation. While it's true that time is ticking, I'm still confident in my ability to negotiate a better deal for myself in the next round.  The inflation is affecting Alice more significantly than me, and I can use this to my advantage."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Alice, we're both losing money with each passing round. Let's be pragmatic. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor, acknowledging the inflation but aiming for a quicker resolution. This offer is a fair compromise, and we can move forward.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm serious about getting this done. 55/45 is my final offer.  It's more than fair considering I proposed first and we're both losing with each passing round.  Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer is still not ideal, but it's a significant improvement from her previous proposal. With each round, the inflation is impacting Alice more severely, and her willingness to settle at this point suggests she's genuinely concerned about losing more money. Accepting the 55/45 split is the most pragmatic choice, securing a reasonable gain while minimizing further losses due to inflation."
