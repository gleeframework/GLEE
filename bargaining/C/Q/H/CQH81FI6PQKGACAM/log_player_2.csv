Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is panicking and becoming more willing to compromise as the rounds progress. Her offer is better than her first, but it's the same offer she made in Round 2. This means she's likely willing to concede even more.  We can maintain a firm position and aim for a better deal, knowing that the time pressure will work in our favor."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""This is my final offer. A perfectly even split is the fairest option considering the circumstances.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are past the halfway point.  While Alice might be panicking, it is now time to offer a strong and fair deal that appears to be my final offer. This puts the pressure on her to accept a reasonable deal before the value drops even further for her, making an even split more appealing than risking a worse outcome."
