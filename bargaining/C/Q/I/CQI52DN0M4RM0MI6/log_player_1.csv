I'm proposing to take $900,000 and give Bob $100,000.  This is a good starting point, as it gives Bob a small share but leaves me with the majority.  Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation!  I'm not going to accept this offer. I'll make a better proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000, which is more than he got in his last offer.  I'm still getting a good share, and I think this will be more tempting than waiting for the next round."
