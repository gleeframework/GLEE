"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's start with an even split, Bob.  Fair is fair, right?""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be practical, Alice.  I'm losing money every round we wait. This is a good deal for you. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
 
While the offer is tempting, it's still quite unfavorable. It's better to hold out and see what Bob offers next round. The inflation hurts Bob more than me, and I might be able to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Bob, we're both losing money each round.  Let's find a compromise.  I'm willing to take slightly more, but I want to end this quickly.""}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time. This is my final offer. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

Bob's offer is still unfavorable, but it's getting progressively worse for him each round.  Taking this offer gives me a reasonable amount, and avoids the risk of getting nothing at all if we run out of time."
