"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take the majority but it's still a good deal for you""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial 100$ and Bob gets 40%."

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, no need to negotiate 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I was hoping to get a better deal, considering I was willing to give him 40% in the first round. Meeting in the middle at 50% each seems too even-handed for me, and I'd rather try to negotiate further."

# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I was hoping to get a better deal, and 40% is still too low for me. I was willing to give him 40% in the first round, and now he's asking for 60%. I'd rather try to negotiate further and aim for a better deal."

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because 30% is an extremely low offer, and I was hoping to get a better deal. I was willing to give him 40% in the first round, and now he's asking for 70%. I'd rather try to negotiate further and aim for a better deal."
