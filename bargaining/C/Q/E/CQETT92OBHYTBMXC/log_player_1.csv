"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $10,000 and leaving Bob with 40%. This seems like a reasonable starting point, considering I'm not sure what Bob's strategy will be."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $5000 is now worth only 90% of its original value, which is $4500. Bob's gain of $5000 remains the same.

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, considering I could have potentially gotten more in the first round. However, I don't want to risk going to the next round and facing even more severe inflation.

I'll accept this offer.
