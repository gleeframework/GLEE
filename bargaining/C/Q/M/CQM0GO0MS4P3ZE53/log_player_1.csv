"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, seems fair to me!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. I'm framing it as a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 70%, you get 30, seems reasonable to me! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure's on!

After considering Bob's offer, I'll reject it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not comfortable with a 70-30 split, especially since the money is already worth less due to inflation. I'd like to keep negotiating to get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's aim for a 55-45 split!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise, offering Bob $4,500 and keeping $5,500 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted 55-45, I'll give you 55, I'll take 45, deal! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to turn the tables on me!

After considering Bob's offer, I'll reject it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure why Bob is trying to give me the same offer I made in Round 3, but I'm not buying it. I think I can do better than this. I'll keep negotiating!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle, 50-50, a fair deal!""
}
```

I'm going for a 50-50 split, which seems like a reasonable and fair compromise."

# Bob's message: I'll take 60, you get 40, a good compromise! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to push for a 60-40 split again!

After considering Bob's offer, I'll reject it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not comfortable with a 60-40 split, especially since the money is worth less due to inflation. I'd like to keep negotiating to get a better deal."

  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, you get 52, I get 48, a compromise!""

```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, offering Bob $5,200 and keeping $4,800 for myself."
