"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets the remaining 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 55/45 is a more balanced split.  Let's see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'll consider the offer in terms of the new value. If I accept this offer, I'll get 45% of the current value, which is approximately 45% of $95 (since $100 * (1 - 0.05) = $95).

Considering the offer, I think 55/45 is a bit too skewed in Bob's favor, especially since the money is worth less due to inflation. I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""I'll compromise at 52/48. It's still a fair split, considering the inflation!""}

I'm proposing that I get 52% of the current value, which is approximately $49.40 (since $100 * (1 - 0.05)^2 = $95.05 * 0.52 = $49.40), and Bob gets the remaining 48%, which is approximately $50.60."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time. We're both losing money with each round, so let's try to find a compromise. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money I gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I'll consider the offer in terms of the new value. If I accept this offer, I'll get 50% of the current value, which is approximately $50 (since $100 * (1 - 0.1426) = $85.73 * 0.5 = $42.86).

Considering the offer, I think an even split is a good idea, especially since we're both losing value due to inflation. I'll accept this offer.
