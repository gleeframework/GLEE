"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}

I'm offering Bob $3,000 and keeping $7,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my $7,000 from the first round is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $5,600. With the new offer, I'll be getting $4,000, which is less than what I would have gotten in the first round.

I'll reject this offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, my $5,600 from the previous round is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $4,480. I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of money.

Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}

I'm offering Bob $5,000 and keeping $5,000 for myself."
