4500.0,5500.0,"Considering the inflation rates, I think this is a fair split. You lose more value each round, so it's in your interest to accept this offer.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5600.0,4400.0,"Bob, let's be realistic. The inflation hurts me more, I need a larger share to make this worthwhile. This offer is my compromise.",Alice,3,

4200.0,5800.0,"I understand that inflation is affecting you more, but I also need to consider my own losses. This offer is a bit more generous than before, but I'm still taking into account the difference in our inflation rates. It's time to meet in the middle!",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5300.0,4700.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous. We're both losing money by being stubborn. I'm making a final offer - meet me halfway and we can both walk away with something decent.",Alice,5,
