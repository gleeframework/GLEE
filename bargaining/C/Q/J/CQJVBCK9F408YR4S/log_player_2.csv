"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and end this quickly. I propose a 60/40 split. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. While it seems fair on the surface, I know that the money is worth less to Alice with each passing round. I want to see if I can get a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I'm feeling generous. Let's reverse your offer from last round. This way we both get a bit more than we would with your proposal, and we can end this quickly.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your generosity is appreciated, but let's be reasonable. This deal accounts for the inflation and gives us both a decent share. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation is starting to bite. This offer gives me a decent amount of money, and it's likely that if I reject it, Alice will propose an even less favorable deal in the next round."
