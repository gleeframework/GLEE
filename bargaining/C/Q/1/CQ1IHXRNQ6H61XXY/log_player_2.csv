"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 90% of its original value after one round, the total amount is now 9,000$. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, the money is now worth 81% of its original value. My gain would be 81% of 4000, which is 3240, and Alice's gain would be 81% of 6000, which is 4860. Since Alice's offer is more favorable to me than the original 81% of the original offer, I accept this offer.
