Round 13
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I think we've reached the end of the road!

Since Bob's last offer was to take it all, I'm not sure what else I can offer. But I'll try to make one last attempt:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Fine, we can split it down the middle, like in round 2. Better late than never!""
}
```

This is essentially the same offer that Bob made in round 2, and I'm hoping he'll accept it now that he's had a chance to see how things have played out."
