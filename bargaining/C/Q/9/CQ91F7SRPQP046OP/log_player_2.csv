Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bigger share to make this worthwhile for me.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.

# Alice gain: 600000

Alice's offer is getting closer, but it's still not enough.  I need to hold out and see if I can get a better deal.  Inflation is working against me, but I need to try to maximize my gain."
