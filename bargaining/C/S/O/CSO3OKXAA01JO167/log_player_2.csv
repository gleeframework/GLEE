Round 3

# Alice gain: 5800

Round 4

""bob_gain"": 5100,
""alice_gain"": 4900,
""message"": ""This is practically even. Don't lose more to inflation!""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Middle ground, come on! 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate, but this offer is still not in Bob's favor. The longer the game goes on, the more the inflation hurts Alice, giving Bob a stronger bargaining position."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Time is running out, and your share is shrinking. Take the deal now!""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Increasing pressure:**  Alice is feeling the heat of inflation, and each rejection further diminishes the value of her potential gain. 
* **Slight concession:** Bob is offering slightly more than in round 4, showing a willingness to negotiate but maintaining a firm stance. 
* **Urgency:** The message emphasizes the time constraint, pushing Alice towards accepting before her position weakens further."
