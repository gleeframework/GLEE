"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you a decent amount, but don't expect me to give away all the money!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that. Let's split it more evenly. I'm willing to give you a good share, but I'm not going to let you take the majority. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the reduced value of money due to inflation, my gain of $4,500 is equivalent to $4,275 in the original value (since 95% of $4,500 is $4,275).

Bob's gain of $5,500 is equivalent to $4,400 in the original value (since 80% of $5,500 is $4,400).

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, but I'll consider it. I'll reject the offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,

  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get a decent amount to make it worth my while. This is my best offer so far.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000."
