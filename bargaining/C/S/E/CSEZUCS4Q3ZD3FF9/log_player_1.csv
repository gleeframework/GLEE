"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 525000,
""bob_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Let's be fair and efficient. This offer benefits us both.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Value of Money:**  While Bob doesn't experience inflation in this scenario, I do.  The longer the game goes on, the less that $1,000,000 will be worth to me. It's in my best interest to settle quickly.
* **Fairness:** I'm starting with a slightly advantageous offer. It gives me a bit more, acknowledging the time pressure I'm under, but it's still a reasonable split that Bob might accept to avoid going through multiple rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be practical - I'm taking a larger share this round.  I'm sure you can see the benefit of accepting, as we both stand to lose money if we keep going. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly skewed in his favor, taking advantage of my time pressure. While I do lose value with each round, accepting a deal this bad sets a terrible precedent. I need to show Bob I'm willing to walk away from a bad deal, even with the inflation working against me.  There's a chance he'll offer something more reasonable in the next round to avoid further losses on his end."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. I'm losing money with every round, but I'm not desperate. A 50/50 split is the fairest option.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** By proposing a 50/50 split, I'm demonstrating that I'm serious about negotiating a fair deal. I'm not backing down from my rejection in the previous round.
* **Highlighting Losses:** My message emphasizes the fact that I'm actively losing money with each passing round. This reinforces the urgency for Bob to accept a reasonable offer.
* **Simplicity and Clarity:**  A 50/50 split is the easiest proposal to understand. There's no room for misinterpretation or strategic maneuvering. It's a clean and straightforward deal."
