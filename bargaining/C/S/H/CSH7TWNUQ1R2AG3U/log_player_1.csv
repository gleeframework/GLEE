"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you a decent amount to start the negotiations.""
}
```

This way, I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving Bob a relatively generous offer to start the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's time we flipped the script, Alice.  Since I'm taking a hit from inflation, I'm offering you a bit less.  Let's see if we can get this done before things get even tougher. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting twist with the inflation!

After considering Bob's offer, I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting the offer because I think I can do better than a 40-60 split, especially considering that my gain is not affected by inflation. I'd like to propose a new offer to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, Bob. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly smaller share, but still trying to find a mutually beneficial deal."
