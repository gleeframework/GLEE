"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### Step 1: Determine the initial offer
Given that the game involves negotiation and the value of money decreases by 5% each round, it's strategic to start with an offer that is somewhat favorable to me (Alice) but not so extreme that it immediately discourages Bob from accepting or continuing negotiations.

### Step 2: Calculate the offer amounts
Considering the strategy, let's propose that I take 60% of the $100, which is $60, and Bob gets the remaining 40%, which is $40. This split gives me a slight advantage but leaves room for negotiation.

### Step 3: Formulate the message to Bob
The message should be concise and encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously, given the decreasing value of the money over rounds.

### Step 4: Construct the JSON offer
Based on the above steps, the JSON offer will include my proposed split and a message to Bob.

The final answer is:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly considering the decreasing value over time.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fairer to split the money more evenly, considering the time constraint and the decreasing value of the money. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","### Step 1: Evaluate Bob's offer
Bob has offered a split where I (Alice) get $49 and he gets $51, with a message emphasizing the fairness of a more even split given the time constraint and the decreasing value of money.

### Step 2: Consider the impact of inflation
Since we are in the second round, the money is worth 5% less than in the first round. This means the actual value of the money offered is slightly less than the face value.

### Step 3: Assess the strategic implications
Accepting this offer means I would be settling for slightly less than half, considering the original amount was $100. Rejecting it would give me the opportunity to propose a new split but risks further devaluation of the money if Bob rejects my next offer.

### Step 4: Make a decision based on the current offer and potential future outcomes
Given that the offer is relatively fair and the decreasing value of money over time, it might be strategic to accept this offer rather than risking further loss of value in subsequent rounds.

The final answer is:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
