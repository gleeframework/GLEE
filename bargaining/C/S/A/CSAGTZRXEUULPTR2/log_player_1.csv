"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fairer. Let's go with 60/40. This way, we both get a good amount, and we don't have to go through more rounds and risk losing value. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
