I propose a 9000/1000 split, keeping 90% for myself and giving Bob 10%.  This seems like a fair starting point, considering the inflation risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

Since Bob rejected my previous offer, I will lower my share slightly, but still offer a significant amount to Bob, hoping to incentivize him to accept.  I'm still aware of the inflation risk, but also want to avoid getting stuck with a drastically smaller share later in the game."

With each round, inflation is taking a bigger toll, but I still believe I can secure a reasonable share. I'm lowering my share slightly, hoping that Bob will see the benefit of accepting a fair deal before inflation forces us both into a much worse outcome."
