Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fairer, considering the inflation will hit you harder. Let's end this now. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{

""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Okay, Bob, let's be reasonable. I'll take $55, you take $45. This is my final offer.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  Each round makes the $100 pot less valuable. While Bob's offer was tempting, it's risky to assume he'll offer more later as the shrinking pot might make him desperate.
* **Strategic Concession:**  Appearing slightly flexible can encourage Bob to settle. By going up to $55 for myself (from the initial $60), I signal a willingness to negotiate but remain firm on getting a larger share.
* **Finality:**  Adding ""final offer"" increases the pressure. Bob knows if he rejects this, there's a chance I might accept a less favorable deal out of desperation in a later round."
