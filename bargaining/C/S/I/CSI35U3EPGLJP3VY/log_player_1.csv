I propose a 900,000 to 100,000 split, favoring myself slightly as the proposer. I'm aiming for a fair but slightly advantageous deal in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm offering an 800,000 to 200,000 split.  Since Bob's offer was unfair, I'm taking a slightly larger share to compensate for the inflation we've experienced. I'm aiming for a more balanced outcome this time."
