"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, and see how it goes from here!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, to see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share this time, let's see how you respond 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my expectations. I'm not thrilled about giving up 60% of the remaining money, but I don't want to risk going into the next round with even less value.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer and take the 40% share."
