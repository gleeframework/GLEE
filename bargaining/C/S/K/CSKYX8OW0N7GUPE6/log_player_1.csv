Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal than your initial offer. Let's split it 55/45, which is still fair for both of us in the early stages of the game. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
