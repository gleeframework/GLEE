Let's see if we can get a better deal!"

I'm going for a more even split, hoping Alice will see the value in getting a decent amount now rather than waiting for the next round and risking a smaller share."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice is trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I'm still holding out for a better deal.  Let's see what she offers next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}
```

With inflation biting, I'm offering an even split to incentivize Alice to accept before the value of the money drops further."
