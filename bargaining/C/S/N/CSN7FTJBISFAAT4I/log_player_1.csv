"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 10% and keep 90%""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 10% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $100,000, and keeping the remaining 90% for myself, which is $900,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a fair split: 90% for me, 10% for you.  Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks he's being fair, but I'm not so sure.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer. I think I can do better than 10% of the (already-inflated) amount."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation has taken its toll, and the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round. Time to adjust my offer!

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""You're being too greedy, Bob! I'll give you 20% and keep 80%""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the current amount, which is $200,000, and keeping the remaining 80% for myself, which is $800,000."
