"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40. I'll give you a good deal!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and give Bob $4,000. I think this is a fair split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than 60-40. Let's split it 60-40, but in my favor this time.  Deal? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not a chance! Bob thinks he can do better than my original offer, but now he's trying to take the better end of the deal. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Now it's my turn again. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to take a larger share, considering the money is still worth the same for me but 20% less for Bob.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting the better deal this time. Take it or leave it!""
}
```"
