"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount of money and can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer. We can still get a decent amount each and avoid further rounds. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $400,000 is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, which is $480,000. Bob's gain of $600,000 is now worth 95% of what it was in the first round, which is $570,000.

I think Bob's offer is a bit too skewed towards his favor, especially considering the inflation effect. I'd rather not accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is now worth 64% of its original value (0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64). I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

This way, I'm offering a slightly higher share to Bob, considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation."
