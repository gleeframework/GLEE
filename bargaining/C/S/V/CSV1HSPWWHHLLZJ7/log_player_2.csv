Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor.  This is a strong offer considering the time pressure and the fact that your potential share diminishes with each round. Don't let this opportunity slip away.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out for both of us. I'm being very fair with this revised offer. Don't be greedy. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate, which works in my favor.  While her offer is a bit better, it's clear she's feeling the pressure of the shrinking pot. I need to hold out for a much better deal."

{

""alice_gain"": 400000,

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm lowering my demand again, showing my willingness to compromise.  It's time for you to be reasonable, accept a fair deal, and let's end this. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure, offering me a slightly better deal but still heavily favoring her. My refusals are weakening her resolve. I need to hold firm for another round or two to secure a much more advantageous agreement."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm meeting you halfway with a 55/45 split. This is a very reasonable offer given the circumstances.  Let's be sensible and close this deal. Every round that passes hurts you more than me.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear you're trying to play hardball, but this is my final offer. Accept it, and we both walk away with something substantial. Reject it, and we'll both lose out in the end. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision, but the risk of walking away with nothing is becoming too great.  Alice is clearly at her limit and unlikely to offer anything better. Accepting this offer guarantees a significant sum, even if it's not the ideal split.  It's better to secure a win now than risk losing it all in the later rounds."
