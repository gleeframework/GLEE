"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

# Alice's message: Only a small concession, still hoping we can settle 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting closer, but I still want a bit more 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is stubbornly sticking close to her initial offer, and while I'm feeling the pressure of inflation, I need to hold out for a better deal.  Accepting now would mean losing a significant chunk of the potential gains due to the accumulating inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""How about we meet in the middle? This is a better deal than you'll get if we keep going.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show willingness to compromise, but I'm still aiming for a near-even split. Alice needs to understand that the longer this goes on, the less favorable the outcome will be for me due to inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're right, we should end this soon. This is my final compromise 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough one. Alice is signaling this is her final offer, and the pressure from inflation is mounting. However, accepting now means losing almost half the value of my initial potential gains. I need to hold out a bit longer and hope Alice is bluffing about her final compromise."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 47, ""alice_gain"": 53, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. Take this offer, or I'm sticking to my guns from now on.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm edging closer to Alice's last offer, signaling a final attempt at negotiation. The message is more forceful, implying that I won't budge further and emphasizing the negative consequences of continuing for both of us. Alice needs to understand that my position is weakening with every round due to inflation."
