Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. A perfectly even split. Take it or leave it - we both lose if this drags on. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI accepted Bob's offer. Given the significant impact of inflation on the value of the money, especially for Bob, and considering this is his ""final offer,"" I believe accepting the even split is the best decision. The risk of losing everything if the game continues outweighs the potential benefits of negotiating further. An even split at this point seems fair, especially since the value of the money has decreased substantially. It's time to close the deal!"
