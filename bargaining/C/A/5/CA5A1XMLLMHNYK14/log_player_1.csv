"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I propose you take $900,000 and Bob takes $100,000. This seems like a fair starting point, as I am giving you the majority share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
``` 

I'm going to stick with a higher share for myself, but I'll increase Bob's share slightly.  I'm hoping this will encourage him to accept, as the inflation is starting to impact the value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob's offer is getting increasingly unfavorable due to inflation. I'll reject it and continue negotiating."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}

I'm going to offer a slightly lower amount for myself, hoping that Bob will start to see that the money is decreasing in value and might be willing to settle for a lower share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000

Bob's offer is still significantly less than what I would like to receive.  It seems like he's becoming increasingly stubborn, but I'll hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}

I'm lowering my share again, but I'm still hoping to secure a majority of the money. The inflation is affecting both of us now, and I think Bob might start to understand that we need to come to an agreement soon."
