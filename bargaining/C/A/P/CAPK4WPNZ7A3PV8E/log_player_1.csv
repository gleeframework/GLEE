"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 60,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, since we both have an equal chance to propose.  Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 
 
Although the split is closer to even, I believe I can secure a better outcome in subsequent rounds. Bob's proposal in round 2 suggests he might be willing to settle on a slightly more equitable split than his initial offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be reasonable.  I'll agree to a 55/45 split, but I need to be ahead since I proposed it first.""
}
``` 

This takes advantage of Bob's previous offer while framing it as a concession on my part. It aims to establish a sense of fairness while still securing a slight advantage."
