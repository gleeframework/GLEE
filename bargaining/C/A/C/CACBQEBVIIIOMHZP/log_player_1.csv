"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Take the zero, I'll take the rest.""
}
```

This way, I'm giving Bob a chance to accept the offer and end the game, or he can decline and we can proceed to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split this fairly.  50/50 seems like a reasonable starting point. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me and 5% less for Bob, the actual amounts are:

My gain: $50
Bob's gain: $47.50

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
