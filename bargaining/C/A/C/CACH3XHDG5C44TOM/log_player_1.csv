Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and be done with it!""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, where we each take $500,000."

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 400k, but I think you can do better 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 400k offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

I'm trying to make a slightly more competitive offer, but still trying to hold onto some value."

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I think you're still getting a good deal 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my offer! With the money I gain being worth 14.26% less, I'm getting a much worse deal than I was initially.

However, I don't want to give up entirely. I'll consider Bob's offer, but I'm not thrilled about it.
