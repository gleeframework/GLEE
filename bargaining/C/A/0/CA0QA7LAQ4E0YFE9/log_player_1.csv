Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm offering Bob a small share to start, hoping to secure a quick agreement. I'll be more generous if we go to further rounds, but I want to see if he's willing to accept a smaller share early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer to get a larger share, Bob's offer is reasonable considering the inflation and the limited rounds. It's better to accept and secure half the money than risk getting nothing in the end."
