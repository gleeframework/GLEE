"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, but I'll take a slight majority to ensure I don't get stuck with less in the long run. 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While 2,000 is something, it's a very lopsided split. I'm going to try and negotiate a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is fair, given the potential for inflation. It gives us both a decent share, and leaves room for future negotiations if we don't reach an agreement.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share, but I still think I deserve a majority. This way, we both get a decent amount, and I can still protect my interests in case of further inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would prefer a more even split, accepting this offer guarantees me a significant amount of money, and the risk of further inflation makes it increasingly likely that I'll get less in future rounds."
