"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the higher share, but I'll give you a decent amount too. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation, my gain of 4000 is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to 3200 in the first round. This is a significant reduction.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, considering I was hoping for a more even split. However, I don't want to risk going into further rounds and losing even more value due to inflation.

I'll accept this offer, hoping that Bob will keep his word and give me a decent amount.
