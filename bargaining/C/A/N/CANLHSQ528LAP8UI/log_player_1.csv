"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair and reasonable starting point. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit less, but I'm still generous! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation taking a toll on my potential gain, I'll have to be more cautious. Since Bob's offer is still a significant amount, I'll consider it. However, I'm not sure if I want to give him the majority of the money.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation has taken a toll on my potential gain, I'll make a new offer that takes this into account. Since I want to get a better deal, I'll propose a smaller amount for Bob.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""You gave me less last round, now it's my turn to give you less""
}
```

This offer reflects the reduced value of the money due to inflation, and I'm hoping Bob will be willing to accept it."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not getting taken advantage of! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation continuing to erode the value of the money, I'll have to be careful with my decisions. Bob's offer is still a bit skewed in his favor, but I'm not sure if I want to reject it and risk getting an even worse deal in the next round.

However, I'm not satisfied with the 450,000 I'd get from this offer. I'll reject it and hope for a better deal in the next round.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the continued inflation and the fact that I've rejected two of Bob's offers, I'll try to be more aggressive in my proposal. I'll aim to get a larger share of the remaining money, but still leave some room for Bob to accept.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking a bigger share, but it's still a fair deal""
}
```

This offer reflects the reduced value of the money due to inflation, and I'm hoping Bob will see it as a reasonable compromise."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not giving up yet! 
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation taking a significant toll on the value of the money, I'm starting to feel the pinch. Bob's offer is still a bit skewed in his favor, but I'm not sure if I want to reject it and risk getting an even worse deal in the next round.

Considering the reduced value of the money, I think I'll accept this offer. It's not the best deal I could have gotten, but it's better than risking further erosion of the money's value.
