"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
 
I propose to keep almost all of the money, leaving Bob with a small token amount. Since the money is worth less to him with each round, I think he'll be incentivized to accept this offer rather than risk getting less in the next round."

Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I propose a 50/50 split. While Bob's money is worth less than mine with each round, I believe a fair split is the best way to ensure we both get a reasonable amount of money.  Since Bob rejected my previous offer, I am hoping he sees the value in a fair division and accepts this offer."

I propose a 80/20 split in my favor.  I'm willing to give Bob a little more this time, but I'm still standing firm on the fact that he needs to share more of the burden of the inflation.
