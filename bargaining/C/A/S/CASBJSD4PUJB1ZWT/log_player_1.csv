I propose to keep $5500 for myself and give Bob $4500. This is a fair starting point, and I think it's likely Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split this time. This is more fair than Bob's offer, and while the inflation is affecting me, I believe that an equal split is the most likely way to reach an agreement quickly."
