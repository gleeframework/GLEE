"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This way, I'll get $6,000 and Bob will get $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I'll consider the same amount as in the previous round. However, I notice that Bob's offer is the reverse of my original offer, and I'm not sure if it's a coincidence or a strategic move.

I'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I'll stick with my original idea from Round 1, but with a slight adjustment to make it more attractive.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6500,
  ""bob_gain"": 3500
}
```

This way, I'll get a slightly larger share, but still leave some room for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll calculate the actual amounts Bob is offering, taking into account the inflation:

Bob's offer in Round 1: $4,000
Inflation: 10% less each round, so after 3 rounds, it's 10% * 3 = 30% less
Actual Bob's offer in Round 4: $4,000 * (1 - 0.3) = $2,800

Similarly, my gain in Round 1 was $6,000, and it's still worth the same, so I'll consider it as $6,000.

Considering the adjusted amounts, Bob's offer is actually:
$2,800 for me and $6,000 for Bob, which is a better split for me than my original offer.

I'll accept this offer.
