"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice's offer is tempting as it's a decent sum upfront. However, the inflation hits her much harder than me. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Your turn to be generous. This is a better deal considering the inflation.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, this is a more than fair deal. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is trying to take advantage of the inflation, but her offer is still not in my favor considering the faster rate at which her potential gains are decreasing. I need to push for a better split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6500,
""alice_gain"": 3500,
""message"": ""Time is running out Alice, and the value is fading fast. This is my final offer.""
