"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my $5,000 is now worth less, but I still have to consider the offer.

# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my $5,500 is now worth significantly less. I'll have to consider Bob's offer carefully.
