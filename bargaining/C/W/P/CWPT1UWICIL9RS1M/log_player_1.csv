"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  I'm hoping to get a good chunk of the money while leaving Bob with a little something to avoid him immediately rejecting it.  Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm rejecting this offer! While I would get some money, it's significantly less than my original offer.  I'm going to stick to my guns and see if I can negotiate a better deal in the coming rounds.  It's my turn now, and I'll make sure I get a fair share of the shrinking pie!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to 80/20. I'm still aiming for a majority share, but I'm also hoping to demonstrate that I'm willing to compromise a bit.  This time I'm hoping Bob will see the value in taking what's on offer, considering the money is dwindling with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting this offer again! While I would get some money, it's significantly less than my initial proposal and significantly less than what I was offered in round 2. I'm sticking to my guns and going for a better deal.  I'm confident I can negotiate a fairer split, especially as the rounds are getting shorter and the value of the money is diminishing rapidly."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but only slightly to 70/30. I'm starting to feel the pressure of the diminishing money, but I'm still confident I can get a good deal. I'm hoping this offer will show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not willing to be taken advantage of."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting this offer. While I would get some money, it's still significantly less than my initial proposal and significantly less than what I was offered in round 2. I'm confident I can negotiate a fairer split, even though the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to secure a better outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor.  While I'm lowering my offer again, it's still a significant share of the remaining value. With each round, the value of the money continues to shrink.  I'm hoping this compromise will appeal to Bob and we can finally reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting this offer. While I'd get some money, it's still significantly less than what I was offered in round 2, and considerably less than what I was hoping for. Even though the money is diminishing quickly, I'm willing to hold out for a better deal.  With only a few rounds left, I need to maximize my share, and I'm confident I can still negotiate a more favorable outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split.  With only a few rounds left, the value of the money is plummeting rapidly.  I'm hoping this equal split will be appealing to Bob, as it's the only way to ensure we both get a fair amount of the remaining value."
