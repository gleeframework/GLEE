Let's see what I can get.  I'm the one with the advantage in this round.  I'll make a counter offer next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a bigger share, but still leaving Alice with a decent amount. Let's see if she accepts."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd like more, the inflation is really starting to hurt.  I'll take what I can get at this point."
