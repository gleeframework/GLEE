"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 40% and keep 60%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, which seems reasonable for the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'm the one who'll benefit more from this deal 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $2000 is now worth 90% of its original value, and Bob's gain of $8000 is worth 80% of its original value. 

I'm not sure I like Bob's offer, as it seems like he's trying to take advantage of me with the lower value of my gain. I'll reject his offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer. Since Bob's offer was a bit too generous for him, I'll aim for a more balanced split this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm still willing to compromise""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm still not willing to give up too much 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $4000 is now worth 73.9% of its original value, and Bob's gain of $6000 is worth 52% of its original value. 

I'm not convinced that Bob is willing to give up enough, considering the value of the money is decreasing. I'll reject his offer again.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make another offer. Since Bob's offers are still too generous for him, I'll aim for a more aggressive split this time.

  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking a firmer stance, but still willing to compromise""
}

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, let's split it 50/50 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $5000 is now worth 59.05% of its original value, and Bob's gain of $5000 is worth 33.77% of its original value. 

I'm not sure if Bob is being genuine about the 50/50 split, but it's a decent offer considering the decreasing value of money. I'll accept his offer.
