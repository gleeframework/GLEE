"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept this and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get the entire $100, but I'm being generous and offering it to Bob to accept it quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice. We both get half. We can end this now and avoid any further complications. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure if Bob is being entirely fair, considering the inflation factor. If we both get 50, it means I'll be losing value over time due to inflation, while Bob will still be getting a fixed amount. I'd like to propose something that takes this into account."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation factor, I'd like to make an offer that takes this into account. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I'm offering you a slightly lower share. But I'm still willing to compromise to end this game quickly.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40, which is 40% of the original $100, but due to inflation, it's actually worth more to him than it would be in later rounds. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in accepting this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand inflation, but I'm willing to offer you a higher share than your last offer. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take advantage of the situation!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not interested in accepting an offer that gives me less than I initially offered Bob, considering the inflation factor. I'd like to make another proposal that takes this into account."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to take advantage of the inflation factor. Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I need to prioritize my own interests considering the inflation. Accept this and we can move on.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share, but it's still a decent amount considering the value of money decreases over time. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in accepting this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to compromise again to avoid further losses due to inflation.  Let's split the money 40/60 this time. This will give you a good share and ensure we both get something. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to make a more aggressive move!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not interested in accepting an offer that gives me less than I initially offered Bob, considering the inflation factor. I'd like to make another proposal that takes this into account and gives me a better share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make an even more aggressive offer to take advantage of the inflation factor. Here's my proposal for Round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to give up much more. This is my final offer. Accept it and we can end this game.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a very small share, but it's still a decent amount considering the value of money decreases over time. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in accepting this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  we're getting very close to the end. I'm willing to go down to 30 to avoid losing everything.  Let's end this game now and both get something. 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is getting desperate!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. 70 is a decent share, and considering the inflation factor, it's actually a good deal for me. I'd rather accept this offer and get something than risk losing everything in the remaining rounds."
