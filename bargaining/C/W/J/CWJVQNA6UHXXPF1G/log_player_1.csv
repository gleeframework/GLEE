"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\nMy offer is to take $600,000 for myself and give $400,000 to Bob. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair split and accept the offer in the first round, avoiding the loss of value due to inflation in subsequent rounds. The message ""Let's split fairly"" is intended to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, although the split is even, I think I can get a better deal considering the inflation factor. Since the money is worth 5% less for me in each subsequent round, I want to try to get a larger share to compensate for the loss of value. Additionally, I initially offered Bob $400,000, and now he's offering me $500,000, which suggests there might be room for further negotiation. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to try to get a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll offer Bob a slightly larger share than I did in the first round, while still trying to maximize my own gain considering the inflation factor.

{""alice_gain"": 575000, ""bob_gain"": 425000, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\nI'm offering $575,000 for myself and $425,000 for Bob. This is an attempt to find a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's even split proposal. The message ""Meet me in the middle"" is meant to convey that I'm willing to compromise and find a mutually acceptable solution. Given the impact of inflation, I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable offer and accept it to avoid further devaluation of the money."
