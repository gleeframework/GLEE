Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

Let's see if Bob takes my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It's better to accept the offer now. While I'm losing a bit more due to inflation, Bob's offer is still slightly better than what I could get if I reject and make a counter-offer.  There's no guarantee I can do better in the next round."
