"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is a relatively small amount to start with, while I'm taking the majority of the $10,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer to get something, rather than risking losing more in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fairer, considering the inflation we're facing. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing!

Considering the inflation, I'd rather not accept this offer. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal. The 55/45 split still favors Bob, and I'd like to get a slightly better share.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

Let's see what Bob's next offer will be!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob. I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the initial offer I made. Let's meet in the middle!""
}
```

I'm increasing my proposed share to $6,000, while offering Bob $4,000. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to him, but I'm still trying to get a slightly better deal for myself."
