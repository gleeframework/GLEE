"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, let's split it 55/45 this time. We can both get a better deal than in the previous rounds. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Let's take it!  The inflation is starting to bite, and it's better to get something now than risk getting nothing."
