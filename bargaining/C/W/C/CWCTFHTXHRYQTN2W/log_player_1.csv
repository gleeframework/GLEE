"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing to split the $10,000 equally between us, with each of us getting $5,000. This is a straightforward and fair proposal to start the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer. I was hoping for a more even split, especially since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round. Bob's offer is quite lopsided, with him getting 60% of the total amount. I think I can do better than this."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but still a fair compromise""}

I'm trying to find a middle ground by offering Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping a decent amount for myself. This offer is a bit more generous than my initial proposal, and I hope Bob will consider it a reasonable compromise."

Round 4

# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm getting a bit frustrated with Bob's offers. His message mentions that it's a good compromise considering inflation, but I don't think it's a fair compromise at all. The money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth significantly less due to inflation. I think I can do better than this."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4200, ""bob_gain"": 5800, ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I think this is the best I can do""}

I'm trying to find a balance between being generous and being realistic. I'm giving Bob a slightly larger share than before, but still keeping a decent amount for myself. I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to Bob than my previous ones."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm getting a bit desperate, but I'm not willing to accept an offer that's this lopsided. The money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth a significant amount less due to inflation. I think I can do better than this. I'm going to try to make a more aggressive offer in the next round."

{""alice_gain"": 4800, ""bob_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""I'll give you a bigger share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of""}

I'm trying to make a more aggressive offer, giving Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping a decent amount for myself. I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to Bob, but I'm also trying to make it clear that I'm not going to give away too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm really disappointed with Bob's offer. The money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth a huge amount less due to inflation. His offer is extremely lopsided, and I don't think it's fair. I'm going to try to make a more aggressive offer in the next round to try to get a better deal."

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""I'm not going to back down, let's split it 50/50""}

I'm making a bold move and proposing a 50/50 split. I'm tired of Bob's lopsided offers and I think it's time to take a stand. I'm willing to compromise and give up some of my share to get a fair deal."
