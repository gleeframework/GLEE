"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point.""}

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the initial 100 dollars, which is 70 dollars, and Bob gets 30%, which is 30 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a good compromise, let's see if you agree 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split. I was hoping for a better deal, considering I was initially willing to give Bob 30%. I'll try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. How about this?""}

I'm proposing a 65/35 split, which is a slightly better deal for me than Bob's previous offer, but still gives him a decent share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think this is a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm starting to get a bit concerned about the time running out, and the decreasing value of the money. While I was hoping for a better deal, I think this 55/45 split is a decent compromise. I'll take it!"
