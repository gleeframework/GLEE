"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. The current offer doesn't seem fair to me, and I'm willing to take the risk of the money being worth less in the next round to try to get a better deal.\n\n###\n\nPlease proceed to the next round. I'll make a proposal for division. My offer will be 55% for me and 45% for Alice.\n\n###\n\n{""proposal"": {""Bob"": 0.55, ""Alice"": 0.45}}\n\n###\n\nMy message: I think this is a more reasonable split, considering we both want to get the most out of this deal.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a proposal for division. My offer will be 55% for me and 45% for Alice.\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think this is a more reasonable split, considering we both want to get the most out of this deal.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time.  The money is losing value quickly, so we both have a lot to lose by waiting. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI'll accept Alice's offer this time. Since the money is losing value quickly, it's better to accept the offer and get the $5000 now rather than risking further loss of value in future rounds. Splitting it evenly seems like a fair compromise at this point."
