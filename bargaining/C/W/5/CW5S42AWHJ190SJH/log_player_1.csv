# Bob's message: I think this split is fairer, considering the potential for inflation. Let's both take a little less this time, so we can ensure a better outcome for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not convinced by Bob's offer. I think I can do better.
