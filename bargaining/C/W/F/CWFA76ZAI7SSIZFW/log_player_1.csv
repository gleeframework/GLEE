I'm going to offer Bob a small share to start. I want to see if he's willing to cooperate early on, or if he's going to be greedy.  Let's see how this plays out!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept this offer.  Even with the inflation, this is a fair deal.  It's better to secure half the money now than to risk getting nothing at all if we keep rejecting each other's offers."
