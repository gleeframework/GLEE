Let's see if Bob is a fair player!  I'm giving him 10% hoping he'll accept and we both get something."

# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not going to accept this offer! Bob is trying to take advantage of inflation, and I'm not going to let him get away with it. I'm going to try to negotiate a fairer deal in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm reducing my share further, but I'm still holding out for a more even split. I'm hoping Bob will realize that we both need to compromise to get anything at all."

I'm going to keep reducing my share, but I'm hoping Bob will see that we both need to compromise soon. I'm still trying to get a decent amount, even with the inflation."

Bob is still being very stubborn! I'm not going to accept this offer, even with the inflation. I'm not going to let him take the majority of the money. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm getting desperate now.  The inflation is really starting to bite.  But I still won't accept being exploited.  I'm hoping Bob will realize that we're both losing money with each passing round and finally accept a more equitable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

This is getting ridiculous! Even with the inflation, Bob's offer is unfair. I won't accept it. We need to come to a compromise before we both lose everything. I'll try to negotiate a more reasonable split in the next round."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm taking a huge risk here. I'm cutting my potential gains down to 50% to try and force Bob to accept a fair deal.  We're both losing money with every passing round.  It's time to meet in the middle, or we'll both get nothing!"
