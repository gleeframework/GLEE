Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you $1000 to get us started. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1000 and keeping $9000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting strong, Alice. I'll take a smaller share this round to leave room for negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with the offer. I think I can do better than a 7:3 split. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. I'll give you a bigger share this round. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $5800 and keeping $4200 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer to my target, Alice. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think I've reached a good compromise with Bob. The offer is close to the 4:6 split I was aiming for, and I don't want to risk going to another round with the money devaluing further."
