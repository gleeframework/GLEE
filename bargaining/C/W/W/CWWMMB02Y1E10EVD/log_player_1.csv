"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60, you take 40.""
}
```

Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. 50/50 split seems like a good way to start. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less after inflation, I'll consider the offer in terms of the original value.

In the first round, I proposed a 60/40 split, which was worth $60 for me and $40 for Bob. After inflation, the money is worth 80% of its original value, so $60 is now worth $48 and $40 is now worth $32.

Bob's current offer is a 50/50 split, which would give me $50 and Bob $50. In terms of the original value, that's equivalent to a 66.67/33.33 split, which is even more favorable to me than my original proposal.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
