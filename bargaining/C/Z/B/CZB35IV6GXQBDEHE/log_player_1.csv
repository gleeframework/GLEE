"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm starting with a generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept and we can avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the safest option. Bob is now getting a larger share, and continuing risks losing even more due to inflation."
