"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000} 
``` 

I propose taking 900,000 for myself and giving Bob 100,000.  This seems like a fair starting point, as I am taking the majority but still leaving Bob with a significant amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000} 
``` 

I propose a split of 800,000 for me and 200,000 for Bob.  I'm willing to compromise a bit from my previous offer, but I still need to secure a large portion to account for the potential for inflation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is now closer to what I would accept, it is still not enough to cover the potential for future inflation and loss in value.  I will continue to push for a larger share of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000} 
``` 

I'm lowering my demand again to 700,000 for myself, offering Bob 300,000.  This reflects the increased risk of losing money due to inflation in the remaining rounds, but I still need a significant portion to ensure a reasonable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Bob's offer is still not enough to cover the potential for future inflation. I'm willing to consider a smaller share, but it needs to be closer to 250,000 for me to accept at this point."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000} 
``` 

I'm lowering my demand further to 600,000 for myself and offering Bob 400,000. This is a significant reduction from my previous offers, but I'm still accounting for the significant inflation risk. With each passing round, the money is worth less and less, so securing a large share is crucial."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is getting closer to what I'd consider acceptable, it's still too low. With only a few rounds left, the inflation risk is very high.  I need to secure a larger share to ensure a reasonable outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000} 
``` 

Given the high inflation risk, I believe a 50/50 split is the most reasonable outcome at this stage.  It is a significant reduction for me, but it ensures that both of us get something, and minimizes the potential for both of us to lose everything due to inflation."
