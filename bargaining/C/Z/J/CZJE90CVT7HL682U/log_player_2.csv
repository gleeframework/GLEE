Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle, 58-42 is a good compromise. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, we're running out of time. 57-43 is the best I can do. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, the effects of inflation are becoming severe. While not ideal, taking 43% of a shrinking pot is better than risking getting nothing if we fail to agree.
