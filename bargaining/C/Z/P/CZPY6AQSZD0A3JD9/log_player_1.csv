"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and start fresh!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair and reasonable starting point. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject my offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit less, but I think this is still a fair deal 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I need to adjust my expectations. Since my gain is worth 5% less, I'll think about it in terms of the original $1,000,000.

In this case, I'd be getting 300,000 in the original amount, which is a significant reduction from my initial proposal. I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with this offer, especially since Bob's gain is still quite substantial.

I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer, I'll aim for a more favorable deal for myself. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I think this is a better split for me""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45/55 split, which is a bit more skewed in my favor, but still leaves Bob with a significant portion of the money. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject my offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I think this is a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on my potential earnings. Considering the reduced value of the money, I need to reassess the offer.

In the original amount, I'd be getting $400,000, which is a bit less than my previous proposal. However, given the inflation, this is actually a more significant amount than what I would have gotten in the previous round. Bob's gain is also reduced, but still substantial.

I'll accept this offer, as it seems like a reasonable compromise considering the circumstances.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
