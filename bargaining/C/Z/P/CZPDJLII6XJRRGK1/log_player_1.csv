"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering Bob 40 dollars and keeping 60 dollars for myself, with a message suggesting this is a fair split. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or proceed to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. Let's split it more evenly. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, considering the inflation that affects Bob's gain but not mine, I believe I can get a better deal in the next round. Now it's my turn again to make an offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is more than fair""}\n\nIn this round, I'm offering Bob 42 dollars and keeping 58 dollars for myself. Given that Bob's gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, and my gain isn't affected, I believe this offer is more than fair. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or proceed to the next round."
