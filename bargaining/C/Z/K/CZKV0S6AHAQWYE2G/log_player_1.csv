"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving each of us $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my expectations. However, I'm still looking for a fair split. In this offer, Bob is proposing a 2/3 to 1/3 split, which seems a bit unfair.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 420000, ""bob_gain"": 580000}

I'm trying to find a compromise by offering a slightly more favorable split for Bob, while still getting a decent share for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the effects of inflation are starting to bite!

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'm also running out of time. Bob is proposing a 3/7 to 4/7 split, which is still a bit lopsided. However, I'm getting a bit desperate, and $300,000 is a decent amount.

I'll accept this offer, hoping that Bob will keep his end of the bargain.
