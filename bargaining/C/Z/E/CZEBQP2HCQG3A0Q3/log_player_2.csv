"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's split the money evenly! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n### \n\n### Why not? It's a fair offer! 50/50 is a great way to split the money. I'm happy to accept this proposal and end the game here.\n\n### \n\n### (Also, I don't want to risk getting nothing if we can't agree on a division within the 12 rounds!)"
