"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair to me. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or reject the offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm still keeping a slight majority 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less for Bob, he's actually offering me $6000 and keeping $6000 for himself, which is equivalent to $6000.25 in the first round.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. I'd rather have a 60/40 split in my favor, but I don't want to be too greedy and risk Bob rejecting the offer again.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, the game continues, and I'll make a new proposal. This time, I'll try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than Bob's previous offer. Now it's Bob's turn to decide!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm still not willing to give up too much 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values:

My gain of $4800 is worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain of $5200 is worth 14.26% less, which is equivalent to $4468.28 in the first round.

I'd rather have a better deal, but I don't want to reject again. This offer is still a bit more favorable to Bob, but it's a slight improvement from his previous offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, the game continues, and I'll make a new proposal. This time, I'll try to get an even better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5300,
  ""bob_gain"": 4700,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit impatient, but I'm willing to compromise further.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 53/47 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than my previous offer. Now it's Bob's turn to decide!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to get a bit desperate, but I'll give you a 50/50 split 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values:

My gain of $5000 is worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gain of $5000 is worth 22.62% less, which is equivalent to $3888.38 in the first round.

Wait a minute... This is the same offer I made in Round 1! I'm not sure if Bob is trying to trick me or if he's genuinely offering a 50/50 split.

Since I know what I'm getting, I'll take the sure thing.
