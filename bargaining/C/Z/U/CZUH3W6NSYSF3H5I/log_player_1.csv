I'm starting with a very lopsided offer.  This is to maximize my share and minimize the potential for inflation to affect my gains.  Since we have 12 rounds, I can afford to give Bob a tiny amount now and hope he accepts.  If he rejects, I can continue to offer him the bare minimum in subsequent rounds."
