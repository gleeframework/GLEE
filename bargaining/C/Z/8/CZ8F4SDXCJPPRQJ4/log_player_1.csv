"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5}
``` 

I'm going to start with a pretty generous offer to Bob. I figure that by giving him a small portion, I'll incentivize him to accept, especially since we don't know how inflation affects him.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer. It's a huge shift from the previous round and while I'm not sure how inflation is affecting him, I don't want to get stuck with such a small portion.  Let's see what he offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm going to slightly lower my offer. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in a guaranteed, albeit smaller, portion. He rejected my initial offer and then offered me a very small portion, so I think he might be trying to be greedy. I need to show him that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I won't be taken advantage of."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still very high, and I'm not sure what's going on with the inflation. He's clearly trying to take advantage of the situation. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal.  It's getting late, and I need to start pushing for a fairer split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I'm going to lower my offer again, but this time I'm going to be more aggressive.  I think Bob is playing a game, and he's trying to wait until the very end to get the best deal possible. I'm going to show him that I'm not afraid to walk away if I don't get a fair share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still trying to get a very large portion of the money.  I'm going to reject his offer. I'm not sure what's going on with inflation, but I'm not going to get a deal where I only get 15% and he gets 85%.  Let's see what he offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}
```

We're getting close to the end of the game, and I need to start getting serious about a fair split.  I'm going to lower my offer again, but I'm also going to make it clear that I'm not willing to go much lower.  I think this will force Bob to make a more reasonable offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 25 
# Bob gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still trying to get the lion's share of the money. He's clearly not taking inflation into account, or he's simply being stubborn. I'm going to reject his offer.  I'm not willing to settle for 25% while he gets 75% of the money. I'm going to make a counter offer in the next round, but I'm getting nervous with only four rounds left."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm going to lower my offer again, but not by much. I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm serious about getting a fair deal.  This is my last chance to make an offer before he gets to make the next one, and I'm not willing to settle for anything less than 60%.  I'm hoping he will see reason, but I'm not sure what to expect from him."
