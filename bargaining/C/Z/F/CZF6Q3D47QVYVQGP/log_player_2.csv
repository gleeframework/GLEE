Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm being patient 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage.  While my potential gains are shrinking, I need to hold firm for a better deal. Accepting now would be significantly worse than my original rejection."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly. This is fair and avoids further losses for both of us.""} 

**Reasoning:** 

The longer this goes on, the more I lose. Alice knows this and will continue pushing for a larger share. Offering a 50/50 split is the cleanest, fairest way to resolve this. It sends a clear message that I'm serious about a fair deal while avoiding catastrophic losses as the rounds progress."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your loss is my gain, literally 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is being ruthless, but she's winning. The longer this drags on, the worse my position becomes.  Accepting a 42/58 split is far from ideal, but it's better than the deal will likely get, and certainly better than nothing if we time out."
