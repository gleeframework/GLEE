"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but still a fair offer 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation affecting my gains, I need to be more cautious. I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with taking 40% of the remaining amount ($4000) when it's worth 10% less than in the first round.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less after the first round and another 5% less after the second round, I need to adjust my offer accordingly. I'll aim for a higher percentage of the remaining amount to account for the inflation.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a slight majority, but still a fair share""
}
```"
