"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial $100, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, the actual amounts I would get in Round 2 are:

My gain: 70% of 100 * 0.9 = 63 (since my gain is worth 10% less due to inflation)
Bob's gain: 30% of 100 * 0.8 = 24 (since Bob's gain is worth 20% less due to inflation)

I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer was 70-30, I'll try to make a more favorable offer for myself. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","To calculate the actual amounts, I'll apply the inflation rates:

My gain: 75% of 100 * (1 - 0.271) = 75 * 0.729 = 54.675 (since my gain is worth 27.1% less due to inflation)
Bob's gain: 25% of 100 * (1 - 0.488) = 25 * 0.512 = 12.8 (since Bob's gain is worth 48.8% less due to inflation)

I'll accept this offer.
