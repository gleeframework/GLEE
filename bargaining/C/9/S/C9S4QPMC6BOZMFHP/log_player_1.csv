"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80/20, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a split that gives me 80% of the initial $10,000 and Bob 20%. I'm framing it as a fair start, hoping Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, no need to be greedy! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my potential gain is now worth 20% less, so I need to be more cautious. Bob's proposal of meeting in the middle seems reasonable, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject this offer for now and try to negotiate further. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure meeting in the middle is the best for me, can we try to get me a bit more?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my potential gain is now worth 40% less than the initial $10,000. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to compensate for the loss in value. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to make up for the inflation!""
}
```"

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is biting! My potential gain is now worth 48.8% less than the initial $10,000. Bob's offer is still closer to meeting in the middle, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll think carefully before making a decision. Considering the rapid inflation, I'm starting to feel a bit desperate. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure if I can afford to give up more, can we try to get me a bit more?""
}
```"

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""This is my last offer, I need to get a bit more to make up for the inflation!""

# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really eating away at my potential gain now. It's worth 67.23% less than the initial $10,000. Bob's offer is still a bit one-sided, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of time.

I'll think carefully before making a decision. Considering the rapid inflation, I'm starting to feel like I'm in a tough spot. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
