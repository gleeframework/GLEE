"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $10,000, which is $6,000, and leaving $4,000 for Bob. My message to Bob is a friendly and straightforward one, suggesting a 60-40 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's be equal! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","In round 2, the money is worth less due to inflation, so I need to adjust my calculations accordingly.

Since Bob's offer is to split the money equally, that means I would get $5,000 and Bob would get $5,000. However, considering the inflation, my $5,000 is worth 5% less than the $6,000 I would have gotten in the first round, so it's actually equivalent to $5,750 in value.

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, considering the inflation. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was to split the money equally, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's slightly more favorable to me, considering the inflation.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me halfway, but with a slight edge!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 55% of the remaining $10,000, which is $5,500, and leaving $4,500 for Bob. My message to Bob is a play on his previous suggestion to meet halfway, but with a slight twist to give me a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take a risk, I'll give you a smaller share, but it's a good one! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value. Considering the reduced value of the money, Bob's offer is actually quite generous.

In this round, my $3,000 gain is worth 21.18% less than the $6,000 I would have gotten in the first round, so it's equivalent to $4,724 in value. Bob's $7,000 gain is worth 30% less than the $4,000 he would have gotten in the first round, so it's equivalent to $2,800 in value.

Considering the reduced value of the money, Bob's offer is actually quite attractive. I'll accept the offer.
