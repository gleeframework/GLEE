"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split the money, Bob. I propose I take $6,000 and you take $4,000. This way we both benefit from this deal.""}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was a bit unbalanced. Let's be a bit closer to the middle: I take $5,500 and you get $4,500.  This round is your last chance for a deal with at least $4,500. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a tough one! Let's analyze:

* **Bob's Offer:** He gets $5,500, I get $4,500.
* **Inflation:** If I reject, the maximum I can get in the next round (even if I propose taking it all) is $10,000 * 0.95 = $9,500. 
* **Future Rounds:**  Bob knows the value decreases for me and is likely to offer me even less in future rounds.

While Bob's offer isn't perfectly fair, it's the last chance to get at least $4,500. Rejecting is very risky.
