"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair to split the money more evenly. This way, we both get a good amount. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't think Bob's offer is fair, considering the inflation rates. My gain of $400,000 is worth 5% less than in the first round, so it's actually equivalent to $380,000. Bob's gain of $600,000 is worth 20% less, so it's equivalent to $480,000.

I'd rather not accept this offer. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation rates, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob. Let's compromise.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, with me getting $550,000 and Bob getting $450,000."
