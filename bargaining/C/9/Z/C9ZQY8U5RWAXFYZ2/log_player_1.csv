Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want to be fair, but the value decreases for both of us each round.  This offer gives you a larger share than you'll get in later rounds. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
