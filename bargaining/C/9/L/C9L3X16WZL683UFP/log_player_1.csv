I'm going to offer Bob $1000 and keep $9000 for myself.  I'm hoping he'll accept, but I know he might want to try and negotiate for more.  Let's see what happens!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though I'm only getting $1000, it's better than nothing.  If I reject, I have to wait another round, and the value of my share will decrease even further.  It's a tough choice, but I'm going to accept."
