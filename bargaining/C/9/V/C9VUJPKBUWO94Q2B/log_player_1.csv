"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was quite lopsided. Let's be reasonable. I propose a 70/30 split in my favor.  The value of the money decreases for both of us each round, so a fair agreement now is in both our best interests. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
