"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to 70/30. It's still a good deal for both of us, considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to a more reasonable split, accepting 30% now means losing out on potential gains if I hold out a bit longer. The inflation factor is hitting me harder with each round, but it's not at a critical point yet where I should accept any offer presented. There's still time to negotiate for a better deal."
