Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a fairly generous offer to Bob. This might encourage him to accept, especially considering the inflation that's in play.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, it's likely that Bob won't be as generous in the future.  Considering the inflation, accepting a 50/50 split is the best option at this point."
