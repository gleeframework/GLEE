Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'll meet you halfway between my original offer and your counteroffer. 57-43 is a fair compromise.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your last concession, but I'm willing to take the risk. With inflation eating into my share, I need a better deal. 58-42 is my new offer. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of inflation and is trying to push for a better deal. However, she's still asking for a larger share.  While the time pressure is on, accepting a bad deal is worse than no deal at all. Bob needs to hold firm and see if he can get Alice to concede more."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 510000,
""alice_gain"": 490000,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm serious. This is eating into both our potential gains. Let's be reasonable - 51-49 is my absolute final offer.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

- **Time Pressure:** With each round, the potential gains decrease for Alice, and we're past the halfway point.
- **Firmness:** It's important to convey that Bob is serious about his position while still offering a slight concession to encourage Alice to settle. 
- **Slight Compromise:** Moving to a 51-49 split shows a willingness to negotiate but holds a firm line against unreasonable demands."
