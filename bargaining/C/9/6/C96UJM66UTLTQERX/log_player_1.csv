I'm starting with a fairly aggressive offer, aiming for 90% of the money. Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, 50/50 is a fair compromise.  Given the risk of losing everything and the decreasing value of my gains, it's best to accept."
