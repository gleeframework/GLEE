"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. Fair is fair, right? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me in each subsequent round, I have an incentive to finish the game as soon as possible. An even split is a reasonable offer, considering we are in the first round and the money hasn't devalued yet.\n\nMy response is: {""decision"": ""accept""}"
