"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I get a bit more since I'm taking on the risk of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting the offer. While the offer is fair, it's only round 1 and there's a lot of money left on the table. I want to see what other offers Alice might make."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a fair share, Alice, but I also need to secure a good portion of the money. Let's see if we can find a compromise.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, let's try this.  My turn to propose a compromise - slightly more for me since the clock (and inflation!) is ticking. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'm accepting this offer. While I would have preferred a higher share, the risk of continuing to reject offers means I might end up with nothing. Accepting this offer at least guarantees me a significant amount of money."
