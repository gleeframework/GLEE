"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}

This is a relatively generous offer, as I'm giving Bob a significant portion of the money upfront."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, my gain of $4500 is now worth significantly less than my original gain of $8000. I'll have to be more cautious. I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation has reduced the value of the money, I'll make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal. Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}

This offer is more skewed towards my gain, but still leaves Bob with a significant amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on the money's value. My gain of $4000 is now worth even less than before. Considering the reduced value of the money, I think this offer is a good opportunity for me to get a decent share. I'll accept this offer.
