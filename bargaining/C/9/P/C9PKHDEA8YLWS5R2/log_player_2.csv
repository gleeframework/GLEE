"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and avoid excessive devaluation. This offer benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While the offer is fair, I'm not sure if I want to accept it right away. I want to see if I can get a better deal.  It's important to consider the devaluation and see if I can get closer to a 50/50 split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly.  This way, we both maximize our gains before the devaluation kicks in.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer. It's better than waiting for further devaluation. Accept now, or risk losing more. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a more even split, the devaluation is becoming a real issue. Accepting this offer ensures I get something, and it's likely to be better than what I'd get in the next round."
