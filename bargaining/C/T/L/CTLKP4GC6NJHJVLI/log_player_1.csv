I'm starting with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept it and we can both get a good portion of the money.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer to get more, the inflation is a serious threat. This offer gives me a significant amount of money, and continuing to play risks losing everything. Accepting is the safest option."
