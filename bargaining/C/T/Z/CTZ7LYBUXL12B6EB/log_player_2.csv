"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's divide fairly 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 525000,
""alice_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""My turn to propose a fair deal. This considers the time value of money.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Value of Money:**  The longer the negotiation goes, the less the money is worth, especially for Alice.
* **Strategic Advantage:** By making a slightly more advantageous offer for myself, I'm incentivizing Alice to accept quickly. She loses value faster with each round. 
* **Fairness:** While my offer is better for me, it's not drastically so. It acknowledges the initial fairness suggestion while incorporating the time element."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is eating away, let's settle. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Impact:** The money is losing value quickly, especially for Alice. However, it's also impacting my potential gains.
* **Offer Improvement:** Alice's offer has improved from Round 1, even if it's not as good as my Round 2 proposal.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Holding out for a better offer in future rounds is risky.  The longer it takes, the less we both gain overall. It's better to secure a decent amount now than gamble on a potentially worse outcome later."
