"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a very lopsided offer. I want to see if Bob is willing to accept anything at all, or if he's going to play hardball."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer. A 50/50 split is fair, and it's better than risking getting nothing if we keep playing."
