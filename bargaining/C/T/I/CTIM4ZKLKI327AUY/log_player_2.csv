"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split it 60-40. I think I deserve a bit more since I made the first offer. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer.  While it seems fair on the surface, I know that the money is going to be worth less each round, and I want to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think it's only fair that I get a bit more since you rejected my offer. Let's split it 60-40, but in my favor this time.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. I'll take a bit less than my original offer, but I still think I deserve the larger share. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd like to get more, Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, and with the inflation factor, I'm happy to accept this offer."
