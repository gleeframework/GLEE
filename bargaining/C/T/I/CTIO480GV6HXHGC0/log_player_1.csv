Let's see how Bob feels about my generous offer!  ðŸ˜‰"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though I lose a bit due to inflation, getting $5000 is better than risking it all and ending up with nothing."
