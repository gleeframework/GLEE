"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's divide fairly, considering the inflation 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer sounds fair on the surface, the inflation heavily favors me. I lose value much slower than she does. It's in my best interest to stall and negotiate for a larger share in later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""My turn. Inflation makes things tricky. This offer accounts for the shrinking pot.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm pushing for a larger share (65/35) to exploit the asymmetric inflation. My message aims to sound reasonable, implying that I'm factoring in the ""shrinking pot"" for both of us. While this might seem aggressive, it's crucial to leverage my advantage early in the game.  Alice is likely to become increasingly desperate as her share diminishes more rapidly with each round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, let's meet in the middle 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting desperate and trying to appear reasonable, but this offer is even worse for me than her first one! The inflation is working in my favor. While the total amount is shrinking, my relative gain is increasing with each round that passes. I need to remain firm and push for a much larger share, aiming for at least 70/30 in my favor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Time is running out, Alice. This is my final offer. Let's be realistic about the situation.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a calculated risk. I'm holding firm at my desired 70/30 split, presenting it as a non-negotiable ""final offer."" The message is designed to create a sense of urgency and appeal to Alice's rationality.  She's facing rapidly diminishing returns, and accepting this offer now might be her last chance to secure a substantial sum. If she rejects this, I'm prepared to significantly lower my demand in the next round, as the risk of reaching round 12 with no agreement will become too high."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I won't go below this 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly feeling the pressure, but she's still overestimating her bargaining position. This offer is barely better than her previous ones, despite the significant inflation working against her. My 70/30 demand was ambitious, and it's clear she won't accept it. However, I'm willing to bet she'll crack under the pressure of the rapidly decreasing value on her end. I'll wait for her next offer and expect a more significant concession."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Okay, Alice, let's be practical. This is a compromise to get us both something.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm significantly lowering my demand, moving from 70/30 to a 60/40 split. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still securing a favorable outcome. The message is framed as a ""practical"" compromise, highlighting the urgency of the situation.  We're past the halfway point, and the risk of both of us walking away empty-handed is becoming very real. This offer might be just the push Alice needs to finally accept."
