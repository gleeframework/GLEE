"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}

I propose a 990,000 - 10,000 split in my favor. This ensures a large initial gain for me while also leaving Bob with a small but hopefully enticing amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, a 50/50 split is a fair outcome given the inflation.  It's better than the potential risk of getting nothing if I reject and Bob's offer worsens further."
