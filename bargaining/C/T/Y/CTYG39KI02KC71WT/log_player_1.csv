"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor. This is a pretty aggressive start, but I want to see if Bob is willing to accept a lopsided deal in the early rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being very aggressive here. I'm going to reject this offer and try to get a better deal in the next round. Even with inflation, it's not worth taking such a small share this early in the game."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

I'm going to try a more balanced approach this time. I'm offering a 55/45 split, which is still in my favor but gives Bob a more substantial share. I hope this will encourage him to accept the offer and avoid further rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm going to accept this offer. While the money is worth less than in the first round due to inflation, it's still a significant amount.  Continuing to reject offers risks getting nothing at all. It's better to take a more balanced share now than to keep gambling on a better deal."
