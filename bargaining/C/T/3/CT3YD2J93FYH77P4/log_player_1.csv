Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Bob gain: 550000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  We're both losing out. I'm making a final offer - a slight edge to me or we both get nothing. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting this offer is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** With each round, the value of the money significantly decreases. Waiting any longer means a smaller reward, even if we get a slightly better split.
* **Bob's Stance:** Bob's message indicates he's becoming increasingly unwilling to negotiate. There's a real risk he'll lowball even further, or worse, refuse to budge, leading to a stalemate and zero gain for both of us.
* **Certainty:** Accepting now guarantees a reasonable sum, albeit less than initially hoped for. It's better to secure something than risk ending up with nothing."
