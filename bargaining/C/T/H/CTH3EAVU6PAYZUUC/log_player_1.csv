"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a small share, but I think I deserve more considering the initial offer was 3:1 in your favor. This is a fair 4:1 ratio in my favor, but I'm willing to give you a bit more than the initial offer. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{
