"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

This offer gives me $8,000 and Bob $2,000, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less now.

I'll think about Bob's offer. Meeting in the middle sounds reasonable, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll aim for a higher share. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think I deserve more given the risks of inflation.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think I deserve more considering the decreasing value of money due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 6500 
# Bob gain: 3500 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing rapidly! I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. With the money being worth less and less, I'll need to be strategic.

Considering the decreasing value of money, Bob's offer seems reasonable. I'll accept it to avoid further losses.
