"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, and keeping $6,000 for myself. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of $5,000 is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, which is $4,000. Bob's gain of $5,000 is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, which is $4,500.

Since this offer is worse for me than my original offer, I will reject it.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation has reduced the value of the money, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 80% of its original value after two rounds, I'll aim to keep a larger share to account for the reduced value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $3,000, and keeping $7,000 for myself. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the adjusted values. My gain of $7,000 in the third round is worth 52.2% of its original value, which is $3,664. Bob's gain of $3,000 in the third round is worth 73.9% of its original value, which is $2,197.

Comparing this to Bob's new offer, I see that my gain of $5,800 is worth 58% of its original value, which is $2,880, and Bob's gain of $4,200 is worth 42% of its original value, which is $4,200.

Since this offer is better for me than my previous offer, and considering the inflation, I will accept it.
