Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The value decreases with each round, especially for you. I'll take $55, you take $45. It's a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
