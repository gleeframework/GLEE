"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is a 40% share of the initial $10,000. This leaves me with $6,000, which is a 60% share. I'm starting with a relatively fair split to see how Bob reacts."
