"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'm willing to give you a slightly bigger share. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal.  I know I'm losing value faster than Alice, so I need to negotiate a better split for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than that. I'm offering you 40, and I'll take 60. This is a fair split considering our different inflation rates.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your perspective on inflation, but I think we can find a more equitable split.  Let's each take a bit less than we initially wanted, and try to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is hurting me more than Alice. Accepting this offer is the best way to maximize what I get given the circumstances."
