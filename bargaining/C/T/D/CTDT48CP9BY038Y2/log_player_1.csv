"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This way, I get 80% of the initial $10,000, and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I can still consider the $5000 as $5000. But for Bob, it's worth 5% less than his original share, so he's effectively offering me $5000 and giving himself $4750.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
