"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
 
This offer ensures you get a majority of the money while still giving Bob something. It's a good starting point, and we'll see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a much larger share. While accepting this offer would give me something, it's a far cry from what I was initially offered. I'll see if I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm reducing my share slightly, but still keeping a significant majority. Inflation is impacting both of us, and I need to show flexibility to potentially reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly unreasonable. Even with the inflation, his offer is still skewed heavily in his favor. I won't settle for such a small share, and I'm confident I can negotiate a fairer deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm reducing my share again, but I still need to ensure I get a substantial portion of the money. This is a compromise that acknowledges the impact of inflation but still prioritizes my share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offers are becoming increasingly lopsided.  While his share is shrinking due to inflation, he's still demanding a much larger portion than is fair. I will continue to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

We are getting closer to the end, and I need to be willing to give a bit more to reach an agreement. I am reducing my share further, but this offer is still a fairer distribution considering the inflation."
