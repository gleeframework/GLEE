Alice's offer:

I reject this offer. While it seems fair on the surface, I know the money will be worth less with each passing round. I'd like to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm hoping we can come to an agreement quickly before the money loses value.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve the bigger share. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll accept this offer. While I'd prefer a bigger share, the inflation is starting to affect my potential gains significantly. This offer is a reasonable compromise, and it's better to secure something than risk getting nothing."
