Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was quite unfair. Let's be reasonable. I propose 70 for me and 30 for you.  This accounts for the decreasing value of the money. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
