"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm starting with a relatively fair offer, giving Bob a 40% share of the initial $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is affecting me more harshly!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll evaluate Bob's offer. Since the money is worth less, I'll aim to get a higher share to compensate.

I'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round and 30% less than in the second round, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the inflation.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on me!

Considering the significantly reduced value of the money, I'll evaluate Bob's offer. Since the money is worth much less, I'll aim to get a higher share to compensate.

However, Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, which is a relatively fair offer considering the reduced value of the money. I'll accept this offer to minimize my losses.
