"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 4000, and we can reassess in the next round.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 4000 dollars, which is a 40% share of the original 10,000 dollars. I'm hoping this will be a good starting point for negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share this time. You can try to negotiate next round! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is already biting!

Considering the new values, I'll think carefully about Bob's offer:

* Alice gain: 2000 (worth 95% of 6000, due to 5% inflation)
* Bob gain: 8000 (worth 80% of 10,000, due to 20% inflation)

I'm not thrilled about taking only 2000, but I don't want to give up too much more. I'll decide to reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 80% of the original amount, I'll aim for a similar split, but with a slightly more favorable ratio for myself.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55% is a fairer split. Let's see if you agree!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer this time. Let's see if you'll take it! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money!

Let's calculate the actual amounts:

* Alice gain: 4000 (worth 66.67% of 6000, due to 5% inflation in round 1 and 14.26% in round 2 and 3, and 5% in round 4)
* Bob gain: 6000 (worth 60% of 10,000, due to 20% inflation in round 1 and 48.8% in rounds 2 and 3, and 5% in round 4)

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I don't want to risk getting less in the next round. I'll decide to accept this offer.
