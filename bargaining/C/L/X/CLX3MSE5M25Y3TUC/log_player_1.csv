"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me, I'll have to consider that in my decision.

I'll reject this offer. The split is still too skewed towards Bob's favor. I'll try to make a counteroffer in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In this round, the money is worth 20% less than in the first round (10% less than the previous round). I'll take that into account in my new offer.

Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000
}
```

This time, I'm offering a 54-46 split, trying to get a bit closer to an equal split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is getting out of hand!

Considering the significant decrease in value of the money, I'm surprised Bob is offering a 50-50 split. It's a bit surprising, but I'll consider it.

After some thought, I'll accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
