"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, we can always negotiate from here""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and inviting Bob to consider this offer or make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, since I'm taking on the risk of rejection.  Let's see what you think. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I'll have to adjust my thinking.

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, and Bob's gain is worth 20% less, I'm essentially giving up 20% more of the original $1,000,000 to Bob.

I'm not convinced that a 60/40 split is fair, especially considering the risk is shared between us. I'll make a counteroffer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with the 60/40 split. How about 55/45?""
}
```

I'm trying to negotiate a more even split, while still giving Bob a slightly larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the previous round, and the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the previous round.

Considering the previous rejection, I'll make a slightly more aggressive offer to try to sway the negotiation:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to give up much more. This is my best offer so far.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a decent share and protecting my own interests."
