"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can move on!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself, which is a 20% share for Bob and 80% for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a 50/50 split, Alice. It's a fair and simple proposal. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll consider the offer carefully.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 50/50 split just yet. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. But I think I deserve a bit more considering the initial offer was 80/20. Let's see if you can do better.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $3,000 and keeping $7,000 for myself, trying to take advantage of the fact that Bob's offer was 50/50 and I'm trying to push for a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, Alice. But I think 60/40 is a fair compromise considering the initial offer was 80/20. Let's see if you can accept this one. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values:

Initial $10,000
Round 1: $10,000
Round 2: $9,500 (5% less)
Round 3: $9,250 (5% less)
Round 4: $9,125 (5% less)

So, in Round 4, the total amount is $9,125.

My gain is still worth the same as in Round 1, which is $8,000. However, Bob's gain is worth less due to inflation.

Considering the offer, I'm not thrilled about giving up $2,000 more than I initially proposed in Round 1. However, I'm willing to compromise and accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
