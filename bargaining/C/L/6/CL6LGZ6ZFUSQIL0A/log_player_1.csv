Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fairer. I propose $5500 for me and $4500 for you.  Let's call it a day. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{
