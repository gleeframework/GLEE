45.0,55.0,"I think I deserve a bit more, 55/45 is still quite fair.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
50.0,50.0,"Let's go back to the 50/50 split. It's the fairest way to divide the money, and we can both avoid the risks of further inflation.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
42.0,58.0,"I'm willing to take a bit more risk. 58/42 is my new offer. The inflation is affecting me less than you, so I think this is a reasonable split.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
55.0,45.0,"I understand the inflation is hitting me harder, but I'm not willing to accept a deal that heavily favors you. Let's meet in the middle at 55/45. This way, we both get a decent share, and we avoid further risk of losing even more.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
40.0,60.0,"I'm willing to push my luck a bit more. 60/40 is my new offer. With the inflation hitting you harder, I think this is a reasonable split.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
50.0,50.0,We're both losing more money with each round. Let's stop this before we both get nothing.  50/50 is still the fairest option.,Alice,7,
