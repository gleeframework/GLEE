Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This feels fair, as I'm taking on the risk of Bob rejecting the offer and going into the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
``` 

I'm reducing my proposed share slightly to 5500, but still offering a larger portion to Bob.  This accounts for the inflation and the fact that Bob will be making the offer in the next round if he rejects this one."
