  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll take 90% and you get 10%. What do you say?""

# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle! 50/50 split, no hard feelings 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","A 50/50 split is a reasonable offer, but I'm not sure if I want to give up my potential for a larger share. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a stronger offer to compensate for the inflation. Since the money is worth 20% less now, I'll aim for a larger share to account for the decrease in value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""You wanted to meet in the middle? I'll give you a bit less, but I'll still take the lead. 70% for me, 30% for you. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm trying to assert my dominance and get a larger share of the money, considering the inflation."

Round 4

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is a bit more generous, but I'm not sure if I want to give up that much control. I'll think about it for a moment...

Hmm... Considering the inflation, my gain of $400,000 is actually worth significantly less than it was in the first round. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make another strong offer, considering the ongoing inflation. Since my gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'll aim for an even larger share to compensate.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting 60%? Fine, I'll give you 40% and take the rest. It's a fair deal, considering the inflation. Take it or leave it!""

I'm trying to assert my dominance again, but this time with a slightly more even split."

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on my potential gains! Considering my gain of $300,000 is now worth significantly less than it was in the first round, I'll think carefully about this offer.

However, I'm not willing to give up that much control. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really eating into my potential gains now. I'll have to be careful with my next offer. Since my gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round, I'll aim for a smaller share to compensate.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting 65%? Fine, I'll give you a bit more. 45% for me, 55% for you. It's a decent deal, considering the inflation. Take it or leave it!""
