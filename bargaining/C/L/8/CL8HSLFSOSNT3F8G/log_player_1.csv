"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. We can always negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000. My message is a friendly opening offer, inviting Bob to consider a fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try an even split this time.  We can both benefit from getting a fair share early on. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my $600,000 gain from the previous round is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $480,000. Bob's offer of an even split is a good one, considering the reduced value of the money for me.

I accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
