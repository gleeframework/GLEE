"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

This offer gives me $6,000 and Bob $4,000, which is a 60-40 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'll give you a small chunk 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth 20% less, so the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: 2000 / 0.8 = 2500
Bob gain: 8000 / 0.8 = 10000

I'll reject this offer. The majority of the money is going to Bob, and I don't think it's a fair split.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'll compromise and give you a bit more. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

This offer gives me $4,500 and Bob $5,500, which is a 45-55 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'll give you a tiny piece 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth 48.8% less, so the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: 1000 / 0.5168 = 1937.35
Bob gain: 9000 / 0.5168 = 17423.65

I'll reject this offer. The amount I would gain is still relatively small, and the majority of the money is going to Bob.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3000,
  ""bob_gain"": 7000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you most of the money, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

This offer gives me $3,000 and Bob $7,000, which is a 30-70 split."
