Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob. Let's meet in the middle. This offer is more reasonable, and we can avoid more inflation.  Let's get this done. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, she's still benefiting significantly more from the deal.  It's worth risking another round of inflation to see if I can secure a better outcome."
