"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose to keep most of the money, offering Bob only $1.  This is a risky strategy, but it ensures that I get the majority of the money if he accepts.  If he rejects, I'll have to be more generous in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Bob's offer is a fair split, and I'm not sure I can get a better deal in the next round, especially with inflation. It's a good idea to secure at least half the money."
