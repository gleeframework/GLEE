"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

This is a 50-50 split, a fair starting point."

# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new offer, I'll have to think carefully.

I'll decide to reject this offer.
