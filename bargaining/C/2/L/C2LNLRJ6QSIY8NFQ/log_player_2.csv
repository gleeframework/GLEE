Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 60/40. We can't afford to keep going back and forth. This is a much fairer split than the last round, and it's still better than losing everything. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting better, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  The inflation is hurting her more than me, so she's getting desperate. I think I can push for a better deal in the next round."
