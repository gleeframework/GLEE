"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm inviting Bob to accept or propose a new split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but it's a good starting point 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of 30$ is actually worth 24$ (since 20% less than 30 is 24).

I'm not thrilled with the 30/70 split, but I'll consider it. Since it's a ""good starting point"", I'm curious to see if we can negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 16% of its original value (since 20% less than 80% is 64%). So, if I propose a gain of 40$, it would be worth 32$.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I think I deserve more. Your turn!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a larger share now 
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of 15$ is actually worth 6.6$ (since 48.8% less than 15 is 7.7, but due to the 10% less effect from the first round, it is 6.8, rounding to 6.6).

I'm not thrilled with the 15/85 split, but I'm getting desperate. I don't want to go any lower.
