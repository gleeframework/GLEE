Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a more balanced split, and I'm willing to take a smaller share to avoid losing more in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 2000

Do you accept this offer?","{
