Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This proposal divides the money equally considering the risk of inflation. I propose we split it 700000 for me and 300000 for you.

# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This offer is quite unequal, and while I don't know how inflation affects Alice, I know it affects me negatively. I'm going to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I understand your offer, but I think a more equitable split is possible. Considering the risk of inflation, I propose we take 600,000 for me and 400,000 for you. This way we both have a decent amount, and we can finish this game.""
