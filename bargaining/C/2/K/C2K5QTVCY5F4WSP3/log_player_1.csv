"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if he doesn't like it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a 4:1 ratio, I'll take the lead! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not a bad try, Bob!

I'll think about it...

I'd rather not accept this offer. The 4:1 ratio is quite skewed in Bob's favor, and I'd like to negotiate further to get a better deal. I'll reject this offer and make a counter-proposal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's make it 55-45!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can wrap up the game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly smaller lead, but I think it's worth it! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not again!

I'd rather not accept this offer. The 70:30 ratio is still quite skewed in Bob's favor, and I think I can do better. I'll reject this offer and make a counter-proposal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50-50, it's only fair!""
}
```

I'm going for a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will finally accept and we can end the game!"
