"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives Alice a large share of the money (90% of the total).  It's a risky move, but the idea is to incentivize Bob to accept quickly and avoid the inflation factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than what he offered in the first round, it's still significantly less than what I offered him.  Since the inflation rate for me is higher, rejecting this offer is the better strategic move.  I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm lowering my proposed share to 70% but still keeping a majority of the money.  Since Bob rejected my first offer and the inflation is impacting him less, I'm hoping this offer will be more attractive to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, the inflation is really hurting me.  Even though Bob's offer is significantly less than what I initially wanted, it's still a good deal considering how much value the money has lost for me.  It's better to accept this offer than risk losing even more value in the next round."
