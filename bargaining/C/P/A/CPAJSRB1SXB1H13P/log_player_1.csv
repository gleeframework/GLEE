"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and call it a day!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we each get $500,000. This is a fair and simple offer, and I hope Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit less, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 20% less value of the money, but I'll consider Bob's offer.

After some thought, I've decided to:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept a 40% difference in our gains. I'll wait for Bob's next offer and try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give away the farm!""}

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a slightly better deal and protecting my own interests. This offer is a 45/55 split, which is a bit more favorable to Bob than my initial offer, but still maintains a decent margin for myself."
