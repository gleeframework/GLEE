I'm going for a very lopsided offer in the first round.  I figure Bob might be tempted to accept a small amount now, as he'll be losing value faster than me in the next round. Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting this offer.  While it's tempting to take something, I'm still holding out for a better deal.  The money is worth the same to me this round, but it's losing value for Bob. I can afford to wait and see what he offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to increase my share slightly, but still offer Bob a decent amount.  The money is losing value for him, and he's already shown he's willing to negotiate.  Hopefully this will be enough to convince him to accept."
