"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
I propose to keep 90% for myself and give 10% to Bob. I figure this is a good starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer. While it's true that the value of the money is decreasing, I'm still not comfortable with such an uneven split. I'll make a counter-proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
``` 
I'm going to offer a more balanced split this time, with 60 for myself and 40 for Bob.  While I still want a larger share, I'm willing to compromise to avoid further rounds of negotiation."
