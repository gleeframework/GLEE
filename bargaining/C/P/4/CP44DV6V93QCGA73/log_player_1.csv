"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

I propose to take $9000 and leave $1000 for Bob. This feels like a fair starting point, given the potential for inflation later in the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is worse than my initial offer, even accounting for inflation. I'll reject and try to get a better deal in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8100, ""bob_gain"": 1900}
```

I'm reducing my share slightly to account for inflation, but still offering more than Bob's proposal. I believe this is a fair and reasonable offer."

Round 4

# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7290, ""bob_gain"": 2710}
```

I'm continuing to reduce my share, but it's important to remember that the inflation is hurting Bob more than me. This offer should still be appealing to him, given his reduced gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is still significantly worse than my previous proposal, even with the added inflation. I'm confident I can get a better deal if I keep rejecting and negotiating."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6561, ""bob_gain"": 3439} 
```

I'm reducing my share again, but this is still more than Bob's last offer, and the inflation is hitting him harder."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept, even with the current inflation. I'm going to continue to try and negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5904, ""bob_gain"": 4096}
```

I'm reducing my share again, but this is still a better deal for Bob than his last offer, considering the significant inflation affecting him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 86.58% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While Bob's offer is not ideal, the inflation is drastically reducing the value of the money for both of us, and a 50/50 split is the best we can do at this point.  It's better than both of us getting nothing."
