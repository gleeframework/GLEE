"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

This offer gives me the majority of the money (9000$) and gives Bob a smaller share (1000$). This is a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to accept a deal that favors me, knowing that the money will be worth less with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even though the offer is worth less because of inflation, I'm still getting 3000$, which is a significant amount.  I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm increasing my offer to 6000$, while still giving Bob a decent share (4000$).  I'm hoping this is enough to entice him to accept, as the money will continue to lose value with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a 50/50 split, which is fair considering the inflation.  While I'm getting less than I'd prefer, the risk of further rounds means I'm likely to get even less.  Accepting this offer ensures a decent payout."
