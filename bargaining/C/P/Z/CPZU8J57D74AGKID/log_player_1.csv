Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a fairly generous offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can both get a good chunk of the money.  I'm willing to take a smaller share in the first round to see if we can reach an agreement quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best move considering the inflation. I'm losing 5% of my potential gains with each round, and Bob's offer is still significantly higher than what I'd be likely to get if we continue to negotiate.  It's a good compromise given the circumstances."
