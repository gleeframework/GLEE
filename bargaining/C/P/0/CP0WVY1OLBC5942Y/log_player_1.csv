"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I, Alice, propose to take $550,000 and let Bob have $450,000. The message ""Let's divide fairly"" is to convey that the division is close to equal, with a slight bias towards me to account for the fact that I made the first offer. Since the money's value decreases with each round, I aim to make a reasonable offer that Bob might accept to avoid further devaluation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, as I have to deal with less inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n### I reject Bob's offer because, despite his argument about inflation, accepting $450,000 in the second round means I'd actually be getting significantly less value than if I'd accepted a similar amount in the first round, due to the 10% decrease in value for me. I believe making a counteroffer could potentially give me a better deal, considering the devaluation impacts me more severely."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 520000, ""bob_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, meet me halfway""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I propose taking $520,000 and letting Bob have $480,000. The message ""Considering inflation, meet me halfway"" aims to persuade Bob that, given the impact of inflation on both of us, we should meet somewhere in the middle, slightly adjusting from my original offer to account for the devaluation that affects me more. This is an attempt to find a compromise that Bob might accept before the money loses even more value."
