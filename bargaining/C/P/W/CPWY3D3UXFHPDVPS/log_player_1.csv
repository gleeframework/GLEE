Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I want to reach an agreement. This is the same split you offered in Round 1.  Let's be reasonable and end this here. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a tricky situation. While I'd ideally like a better split, accepting this offer is the most logical choice at this point:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is rapidly decreasing for me. Accepting 60 now is significantly better than potentially getting a slightly better deal in later rounds when the value has eroded further.
* **Bob's Stance:** Bob seems fixated on this split, having rejected my previous offers. There's no guarantee he'll budge much further, and we risk getting nothing if we run out of rounds. 

It's a compromise, but the risk of continuing outweighs the potential reward."
