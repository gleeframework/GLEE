"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,

  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the $10,000 into $7500 for me and $2500 for you. This way, we can both benefit from the initial amount while accounting for the decreasing value in subsequent rounds.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fairer, considering the money is worth less with each round. Let's split it 5500 for me and 4500 for you. We can both get a good share before the value drops further. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{
