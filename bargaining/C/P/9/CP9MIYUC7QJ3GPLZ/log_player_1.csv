"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 51, ""bob_gain"": 49}

I propose we split the money fairly, with me getting slightly more due to the higher inflation rate affecting me more. Let's see if Bob agrees to this."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It's a fair offer and the inflation would make any further rounds potentially worse for me. I accept."
