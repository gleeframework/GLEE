"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is a relatively generous offer, considering the initial amount is $10,000. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my offer would have been worth $5,400 in the first round, so I'll have to adjust my expectations.

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a bit too even-handed, but I'll consider it. I'll accept this offer.
