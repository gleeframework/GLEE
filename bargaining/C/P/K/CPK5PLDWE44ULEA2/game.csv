60.0,40.0,"Let's split the money 60/40. This gives us a fair advantage to start, and we can avoid losing money to inflation later on.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"Let's split it 55/45. Since the money loses value for you each round, it's better to settle now.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"I understand the situation with inflation, but my previous offer was already generous. Let's meet in the middle at 55/45.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
42.0,58.0,"Considering the impact of inflation on your gains, I'm willing to offer 58/42. The longer we wait, the less you'll actually receive.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
50.0,50.0,"Bob, it's clear we both want to reach an agreement.  Let's make it simple: a 50/50 split. This ensures we both benefit and avoids further losses from inflation.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
40.0,60.0,"Given the increasing impact of inflation on your share, I'm willing to offer a 60/40 split. This is a fair adjustment considering the rounds that have passed.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
48.0,52.0,"Bob, I'm willing to be flexible, but I need you to meet me halfway. This offer acknowledges the inflation factor while ensuring we both walk away with something reasonable.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
38.0,62.0,"Considering the significant impact of inflation on your share, I'm adjusting my offer to 62/38. Each round further reduces the value of the money for you, making this a more reasonable split.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
45.0,55.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm offering you a 55/45 split - take it or leave it.  This is my final offer.  If you reject it, I'm prepared to let the remaining rounds expire and we both get nothing.",Alice,9,
