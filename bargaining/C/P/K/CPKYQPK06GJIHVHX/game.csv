550000.0,450000.0,"Okay, I see your point. I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 55/45, with me taking the slightly larger share. It's still a better deal than the 40/60, and we can keep negotiating if you're not happy with it.  What do you say?",Alice,3,

480000.0,520000.0,"Alice, we're getting closer, but your 55/45 split isn't tempting enough with the clock ticking. I'm proposing a 52/48 split in my favor. It's a fair compromise considering the time pressure and the risk of losing everything.",Bob,4,
