"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal. This offer ensures you get something now. With inflation, delaying is riskier for you. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob should reject this offer. While it's tempting to take something now, Bob can likely get a better deal in the future. With each round, Alice's share of the money decreases more slowly than Bob's, so Bob has an incentive to wait and see if he can negotiate a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 6000,
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I believe this is a fair split, considering the inflation.  Let's get this done.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a better deal for you than last round, considering the inflation. I'm motivated to close this now. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Even though this offer is slightly better for Bob in terms of the raw dollar amount, it's still a bad deal considering the inflation.  Alice's offer is only slightly better than her first offer, while Bob's share is decreasing at a much faster rate. Bob should continue to try to negotiate for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4

{
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
