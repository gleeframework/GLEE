"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60, you take 40. We can discuss further if you want.""
}
```

This offer gives me 60% of the initial 100$ and Bob 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, with me getting 60. Let's see if we can agree on that. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll calculate my gain accordingly.

My gain would be 40% of 95 (100 * 0.95), which is 38.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd rather not give up 62 (60/100 * 100) dollars, even with inflation. I'll wait for a better offer.""
}
```

I'm not accepting Bob's offer because I'd be giving up more than I would if I were to accept the original 60/40 split from round 1, adjusted for inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less due to inflation again, I'll make a new offer that takes this into account. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you more, but I need to get a good share too. 45 for me, 55 for you. Let's see if we can agree.""
}
```

This time, I'm offering a 45/55 split, which is a slightly more favorable split for Bob, but I'm still trying to get a decent share for myself."
