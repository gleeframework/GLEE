Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60

Round 4

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly before this inflation eats up all the profit!""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, Bob! Inflation is killing your share! 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, accepting is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Severe Inflation:**  The value of Bob's potential earnings has been significantly eroded by inflation. Accepting $35 now is better than risking even less in subsequent rounds.
* **Alice's Strong Position:** Alice knows time is on her side. She's unlikely to offer anything significantly better than this, knowing Bob is feeling the pressure. 

While not ideal, taking the $35 cuts losses and prevents further devaluation."
