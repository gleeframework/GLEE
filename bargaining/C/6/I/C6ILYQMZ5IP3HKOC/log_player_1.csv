```

I'm starting with a very lopsided offer.  Since we don't know how inflation affects Bob, I'm trying to get as much as possible in the first round.  I'm hoping he'll be so surprised by the offer he'll accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate if he doesn't!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with this offer, but I'm willing to negotiate. I'm still hoping to get a better deal than this, and I know I have the power to influence the next offer.  I'm going to reject this one and see what Bob comes up with next."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

This round, I'm proposing a 50/50 split. It's a fair offer, and I'm confident that Bob will see the value in it. We both have the power to make or break this deal, so I'm hoping for a peaceful resolution."

Bob is getting increasingly greedy.  I'm not going to accept this offer. I believe we can still reach a fairer agreement, and I'm willing to keep negotiating. I'm going to reject this offer and see what Bob's next move is."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to increase my offer slightly to try and meet Bob halfway. I'm still aiming for a fair outcome, but I'm also aware that we are running out of time, and the inflation is starting to bite.  I'm hoping this offer will be enough to convince Bob to accept."

# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is really pushing his luck now. This offer is completely unfair. I'm not going to give in to his greed.  I'm still confident we can reach a better agreement, and I'm going to continue fighting for what I deserve."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to increase my offer again, hoping to find a middle ground with Bob. The inflation is really starting to take its toll, and I need to make sure I get a decent share before it's too late. I'm still hoping for a fair deal, but I'm willing to compromise to avoid getting nothing at all."

Bob's greed is getting out of hand. I refuse to accept this offer!  I'm still hoping to get a better deal, and I'm not giving up.  I'll fight for a fairer share."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm taking a big risk here.  I'm raising my offer again, hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of reason. We're both facing the threat of getting nothing if we don't reach an agreement.  I believe a fair deal is still possible, and I'm willing to offer a generous share to make it happen."
