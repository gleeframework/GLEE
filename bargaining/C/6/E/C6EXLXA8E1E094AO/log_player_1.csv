"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split in my favor, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being generous, but I'll try to do better! 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think Bob's offer is a bit too aggressive, considering the money is worth 20% less for him now. I'm hoping for a better offer from him in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle. Your turn!""
}
```

I've adjusted my offer to a 60-40 split, which I think is a fair compromise considering the decreasing value of the money for Bob. Your turn, Bob!"
