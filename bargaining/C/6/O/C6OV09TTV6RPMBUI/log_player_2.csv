Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to find a compromise here. This offer is a slight adjustment from my previous one, acknowledging the effect of inflation on both our ends. Let's settle this before our potential gains shrink further. 
# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to wear me down with incremental increases, but I need to hold firm.  The inflation disparity means I lose significantly more than her with each passing round. Accepting now would still be a loss compared to what I could have gotten earlier, and it sets a bad precedent for future rounds.  I need to show her I'm serious about getting a more equitable deal."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the only fair option.  We're running out of time and both losing money.  Let's end this now and walk away with something substantial.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

The game has reached a critical point. While ideally, I'd want a slight advantage considering the inflation difference, I recognize the need to be realistic.  A 50/50 split is the most logical offer at this stage:

* **Strong Stance:** It shows Alice I'm serious about a fair deal and unwilling to back down further.
* **Time Pressure:**  With only a few rounds left, the inflation losses are becoming too significant to ignore. 
* **Simplicity and Fairness:** A 50/50 split is easy to understand and objectively fair. It avoids further complicated negotiations.

This offer puts the ball firmly in Alice's court. She can choose to accept a reasonable deal or risk both of us losing out entirely."
