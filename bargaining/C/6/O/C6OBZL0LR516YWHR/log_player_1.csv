"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

Round 3

Considering the inflation and the fact that Bob's offer was quite aggressive, I'll try to be more aggressive this time. Here's my new offer:

{

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","The game is getting desperate!

{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}

I'm going for a 7:3 split, which is as close to a 70-30 split as I can get without being too greedy. I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm also prepared for him to reject it and try to make a counteroffer."

{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}

I'll accept this offer, unfortunately. With the inflation affecting my share so heavily, I'm not sure I have much of a choice. I'll take the $1,000 and call it a day."
