I propose you get $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000.  Let's see if he's willing to accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm offering Bob $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself. The money is losing value, so I'm going to try to secure a bigger share this round."
