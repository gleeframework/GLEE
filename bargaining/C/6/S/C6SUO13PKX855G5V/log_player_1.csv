"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. Let's see if he'll accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this new offer. Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, I'll aim to get as much as possible. However, Bob's offer is still quite generous, considering the inflation.

I'll decide to accept this offer.
