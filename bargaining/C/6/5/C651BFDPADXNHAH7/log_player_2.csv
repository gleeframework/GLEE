"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I take a bit more since I'm losing money each round. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject this offer. While it's tempting to get something now, the inflation will hurt me more in the long run. I want to see if I can get a better deal by making a proposal myself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm proposing a more balanced split, recognizing your loss per round. Let's see if we can agree.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my offer is decreasing, but let's be reasonable. We need to reach an agreement soon. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a more even split, I'm concerned about the inflation affecting Alice's gains, and I don't want to risk losing everything. This seems like a reasonable compromise, and I'm willing to accept it."
