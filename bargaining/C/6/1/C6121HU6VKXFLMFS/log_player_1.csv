Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, I propose we split the money almost evenly. This way, we both get a good amount and avoid the risk of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
