Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money in a ratio of 3:1. This might seem a bit lopsided, but consider the decreasing value of money over time.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not willing to give up too much. This is a fair starting point for further negotiations. 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","{
