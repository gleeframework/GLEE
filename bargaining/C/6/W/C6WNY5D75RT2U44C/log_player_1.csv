"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, seems fair""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $10,000, which is $4,000, and I'll take the remaining $6,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split is more fair, since I'm taking the risk of rejecting your offer. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is actually the same as mine from Round 1, but with a different spin. I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll offer a slightly higher share to Bob to make it more attractive.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Take it, or we'll go further down the inflation rabbit hole""
}
```"
