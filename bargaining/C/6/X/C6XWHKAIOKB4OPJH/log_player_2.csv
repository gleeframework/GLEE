Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still thinking a 50/50 split is the fairest option.  We need to settle this before inflation eats away too much of our money. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While a 50/50 split seems fair initially, the impact of inflation is significant. Accepting now would mean I lose a sizable chunk of the potential gain. It's worth risking a few more rounds to negotiate a better deal, even if it means a slight risk of getting nothing."
