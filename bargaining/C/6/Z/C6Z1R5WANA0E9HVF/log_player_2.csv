"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair deal.  I'm happy to split the money 90/10 in your favor.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round to try to get a better deal. Since the money is worth 5% less for me with each passing round, I want to try to maximize my gain as quickly as possible. Rejecting this offer gives me the opportunity to propose a more favorable division in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that is still favorable to me but slightly more generous to Alice than her initial offer was to me. Since the money is worth 5% less for me in this round, I'll keep that in mind when making my proposal.

""alice_gain"": 150000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm still holding out for a better deal. Let's split it 80/20.  This way, we both get a significant amount, and we can avoid further rounds of negotiation and the impact of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlthough Alice's offer of an 80/20 split is more favorable than her initial proposal, I still believe I can negotiate for a better deal. Given the impact of inflation, my potential gain is now worth 9.75% less than in the first round, which makes me more eager to maximize my share as quickly as possible. Rejecting this offer gives me another chance to propose a more advantageous division in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","In this round, I'll consider the increasing impact of inflation on my potential gain, which is now worth 14.26% less than in the first round. Given this, I'll aim to propose a division that is still favorable to me but takes into account the need to reach an agreement before the value of the money decreases further for me.

{""bob_gain"": 780000,
""alice_gain"": 220000,
""message"": ""Considering the rising impact of inflation, I'm willing to offer a 78/22 split. This is a compromise, but I believe it's fair given the circumstances.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, I'm willing to come down a little more. Let's do a 75/25 split.  This is a fair compromise, considering the current inflation, and we can finally end this negotiation. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation, which has reduced the value of my potential gain by 18.55% compared to the first round, I believe accepting Alice's offer of a 75/25 split is the best decision at this point. Further rounds of negotiation would only decrease the value of the money for me, making it less likely to achieve a better deal. Accepting this offer allows me to secure a significant amount, albeit less than initially hoped for, and brings the negotiation to a close."
