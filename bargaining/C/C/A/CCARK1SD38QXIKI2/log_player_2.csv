Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time!  This is my final concession. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 4700 
# Alice gain: 5300 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, accepting is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  The 5% inflation for Bob and 10% for Alice means the value of the money is rapidly decreasing. Waiting any longer will result in a significantly smaller reward, even if Bob manages to secure a slightly better deal in the following rounds. 

* **Alice's Stance:** Alice has labeled this as her ""final concession,"" suggesting she is unlikely to budge further. 

* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While $4700 isn't ideal, it's better than walking away with nothing if the rounds run out. Accepting guarantees Bob a reasonable sum considering the circumstances."
