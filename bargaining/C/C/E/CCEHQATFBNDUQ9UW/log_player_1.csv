"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount, but it's a good starting point. I'm taking the lion's share of $900,000, but I'm giving Bob a decent chunk of change to try to get him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is already taking its toll!

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about giving up $600,000, but I'm willing to compromise. Meeting halfway seems like a reasonable approach. I'll accept the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
