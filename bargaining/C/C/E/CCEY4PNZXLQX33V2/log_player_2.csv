Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're willing to meet closer to the middle, but I still think I deserve a bit more. How about we try 58-42? 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is barely budging while the value of the money significantly decreases for both of us, especially her. It's unlikely she'll secure a deal much better than this in later rounds.  I need to push her closer to a more even split before the inflation eats away at the value."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking, and the money is losing value fast. This is my final offer before I have to start aiming for a more even split.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Pressure:**  Putting a soft deadline on my offer increases the pressure on Alice. 
* **Shift in Tone:** By framing my offer as ""final"" before seeking a more even split, I imply I'm willing to play hardball in later rounds, making this offer seem more appealing.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This offer is still tilted in her favor, but the gap is closing. It gives her a final chance to take a slight advantage before the impact of inflation makes a more even split inevitable."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the urgency, but I'm not ready to give up yet. I'll try to meet you halfway between my last offer and yours. Let's do 56-44. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

It's a close call, but accepting is the safer option now:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  While not ideal, getting 44% is better than risking an even worse outcome as the value drops rapidly. 
* **Alice's Position Weakening:** Alice is finally moving closer to a more balanced split. This suggests the inflation is starting to influence her decisions. Holding out for a slightly better deal might backfire. 
* **Uncertainty:**  There's no guarantee Alice will offer anything close to this in subsequent rounds.  

Taking the 44% now secures a reasonable amount, even if it means conceding a slight advantage to Alice."
