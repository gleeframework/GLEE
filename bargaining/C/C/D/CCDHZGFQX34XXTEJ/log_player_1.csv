"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose taking 90% of the money, leaving 10% for Bob. This seems like a fair starting point, as it ensures I get a significant share while giving Bob something to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm reducing my share to 80% and increasing Bob's to 20%. While inflation has reduced the value of my potential gains, I still want to secure a majority share.  This offer reflects my desire to reach a compromise while also protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While the offer is much less than I'd hoped for, inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money, and continuing to reject offers could lead to an even worse outcome. It's better to take the 200,000 now than risk getting nothing at all in later rounds."
