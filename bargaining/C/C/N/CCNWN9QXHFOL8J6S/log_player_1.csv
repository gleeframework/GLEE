I'm going to start with a fairly generous offer, aiming for a quick resolution. I'll keep most of the money, but I'm offering Bob a decent amount to encourage him to accept.  Let's see if he's feeling generous!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob is being greedy! I'll reject his offer and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

I'm going to lower my offer slightly, but I'm still giving Bob a significant share. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping Bob will realize that continuing to reject offers will only hurt him in the end."
