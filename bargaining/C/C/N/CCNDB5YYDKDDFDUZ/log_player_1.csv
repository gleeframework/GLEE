"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60, you can have 40.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a relatively fair starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next step!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I think I deserve more since I'll have to deal with the inflation 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'll think carefully about it.

Considering the inflation, I'll have to be more cautious with my decision. If I accept this offer, I'll only get 30, which is a significant decrease from the initial 60 I proposed.

However, I don't want to risk going to the next round and potentially getting an even worse deal. I'll take a chance and accept Bob's offer for now.
