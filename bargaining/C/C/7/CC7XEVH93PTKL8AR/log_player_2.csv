Let's see if I can get a better deal."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a 50/50 split. It's fair and maximizes my potential earnings in the long run."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still hoping for a better deal.  While the inflation is a factor, I'm not giving up on a 50/50 split just yet."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500}
```

I'll offer Alice a slightly larger share this time.  This is a good compromise, considering the inflation, and still gives me a decent amount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 5500

Inflation is hitting hard now.  While I'd still prefer a 50/50 split, I'm taking this offer to avoid getting nothing at all."
