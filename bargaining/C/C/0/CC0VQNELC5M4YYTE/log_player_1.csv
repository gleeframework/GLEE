"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

This is a generous offer, giving Bob a 10% share of the initial $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the previous round, my effective gain in this round is only 90% of $900,000, which is $810,000.

In this case, I'll decide to reject Bob's offer and wait for a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, so my effective gain in this round is 90% of $900,000, which is $810,000, and then another 5% less due to inflation, so my effective gain in this round is 0.95 * $810,000 = $768,500.

Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the effective gain I would get from Bob's offer in this round. The money I gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, so my effective gain in this round is 85.74% of $900,000, which is $771,660.

In this case, I'll decide to accept Bob's offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
