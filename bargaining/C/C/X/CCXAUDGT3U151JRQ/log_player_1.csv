"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can reassess later if needed.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try for a more equal split this time, but I'm not giving away too much 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to reassess the offer.

Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll consider the effective values as follows:

My gain: $6,000 * 0.8 = $4,800 (from Round 1)
Bob's gain: $4,000 * 0.9 = $3,600 (from Round 1)

Now, considering Bob's new offer:
My gain: $5,000
Bob's gain: $5,000

Since the effective values are still not in my favor, I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the continued inflation, the money is worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob. I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share this time, but I'm not giving up too much.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, with me getting $4,500 and Bob getting $5,500."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I'm not giving up too much more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the continued inflation, the money is worth 48.8% less for me and 27.1% less for Bob. I'll calculate the effective values:

My gain: $6,000 * 0.516 (1 - 0.484) = $3,096
Bob's gain: $4,000 * 0.729 (1 - 0.271) = $2,916

Now, considering Bob's new offer:
My gain: $4,000
Bob's gain: $6,000

The effective values are still not in my favor, but I'm getting closer to the original amount. I'll accept this offer.
