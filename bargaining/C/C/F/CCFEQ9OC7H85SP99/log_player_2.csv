Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think a more even split is fair. This accounts for the risk of further inflation.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, this is a good compromise 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Reasoning:

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in round 3 is better than risking further inflation. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:**  The money is already worth 19% less. Delaying further will only erode the value of the potential winnings.
* **Alice's Offer:** Alice's offer is getting closer to a more even split.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Rejecting this offer in hopes of getting a slightly better deal in a later round is very risky. The money on the table will significantly decrease. 

It's a tough choice, but accepting now cuts losses and guarantees a reasonable amount."
