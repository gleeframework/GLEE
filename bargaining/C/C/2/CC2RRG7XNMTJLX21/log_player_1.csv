"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start""}

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 evenly, with each of us getting $5,000. This is a fair and simple starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're giving up too much, let's try to negotiate! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'm not thrilled about giving up $1,000 more than I did in the initial offer. However, Bob's message suggests that he's willing to negotiate, so I'll try to counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but not too much. Let's meet in the middle""}

I'm willing to give up a bit more to get closer to a compromise, but I'm still trying to protect my share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I think I can get more 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is taking a big toll on my share! With the money I gain being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'm getting really concerned about my take.

However, I'm not willing to give up another $500 without a fight. I'll try to negotiate again.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4000, ""bob_gain"": 6000, ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, but I'll give you a bit more. Let's try to wrap this up""}

I'm trying to be more generous, but I'm not willing to give up too much more. I hope Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
