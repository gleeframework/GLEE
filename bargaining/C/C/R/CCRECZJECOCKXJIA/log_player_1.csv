"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the inflation puts me at a disadvantage. How about a slightly better split this time? 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer acknowledges the inflation but doesn't adequately compensate for it. While the split is slightly better, it's still advantageous for me to wait. As the rounds progress, Bob's position will weaken, and I can negotiate for a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6500,
""bob_gain"": 3500,
""message"": ""The inflation is working against you, Bob. This is a generous offer considering the circumstances.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer, Alice.  Let's be practical - taking this deal is better than either of us get if this goes any further. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer is the same as my initial offer, the situation has changed.  The value of his potential gains is eroding rapidly due to inflation. If I reject this offer, there's a significant risk he'll propose an even less favorable split in the next round. It's better to secure a reasonable gain now than gamble on a potentially worse outcome later."
