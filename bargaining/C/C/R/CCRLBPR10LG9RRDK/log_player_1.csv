"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, which I think is a reasonable starting point. The message ""Let's split fairly"" is an attempt to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept the offer. Since the money is worth 10% less to me with each passing round, I'm motivated to reach an agreement quickly. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in accepting this offer and ending the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a larger share, but this split is more reflective of the decreasing value over time. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, although the money is worth 10% less to me in this round, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal. Bob's offer of a 45-55 split in his favor is not acceptable, especially considering the initial offer I made was more generous to him. I'm taking into account that the money is worth less to both of us with each passing round, but I'm more affected by inflation. I'll try to make a counteroffer that takes this into account and still benefits me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5700, ""bob_gain"": 4300, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet in the middle""}\n\n###\n\nI've taken into account the decreasing value of the money due to inflation and decided to make a more conservative offer. Since Bob's previous offer was a 45-55 split in his favor, I'm trying to meet him halfway while still prioritizing my own gain. My offer of a 57-43 split in my favor is an attempt to find a middle ground that Bob might find acceptable. The message ""Considering inflation, let's meet in the middle"" aims to convey that I'm aware of the impact of inflation and willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. It's important we settle before the money loses too much value for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on the value of the money, I've decided to accept Bob's offer. With the money being worth 27.1% less to me than in the first round, I believe it's crucial to settle the deal before it loses even more value. Bob's offer of a 49-51 split in his favor is not ideal, but it's a relatively fair compromise given the circumstances. Since Bob has stated that this is his final offer, I'm inclined to accept it rather than risking further devaluation of the money."
