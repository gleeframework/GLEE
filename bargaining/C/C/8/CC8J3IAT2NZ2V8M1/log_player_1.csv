"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept this and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor, but I'm offering a generous share to Bob to try to end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give away too much just yet. This is a good starting point, but I'm hoping to get a better deal later on. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. Since Bob's offer is still a 40-60 split, but the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, while the money Bob gains is worth 20% less, this is actually a slightly better deal for me than the first round.

I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
