"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer in JSON format:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly, considering the inflation""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and I'll take $600,000, considering that the money is worth 20% less for him in each subsequent round, so it's better for him to accept this offer rather than risking a lower value in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fairer to split the money more evenly, as the inflation affects my share more significantly. Let's both get 600k, and we can both benefit more. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","No, I don't accept this offer. Here is my response in JSON format:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting this offer because Bob is trying to give himself a larger share of the money, even though the money is worth less to him due to inflation. In reality, his offer of $600,000 for himself is actually worth less than the $400,000 I offered him in the first round, considering the 20% decrease in value. I'll wait for the next round to make a new offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer in JSON format:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 650000,
  ""bob_gain"": 350000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, my previous offer was generous. This one is more realistic.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $350,000 and I'll take $650,000. Since Bob's share is worth 20% less in each round, his $350,000 in this round is actually equivalent to around $437,500 in the first round, which is still a relatively fair offer. I'm taking into account the fact that Bob is losing value with each passing round, but I'm not willing to give him a larger share than I think is fair."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the inflation impacts me more, but I'm willing to compromise. Let's split the money 550k for me and 450k for you. This is a fairer compromise considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting this offer because, despite Bob's claim of compromise, his offer doesn't take into account the significant decrease in value of his share due to inflation. In reality, his $550,000 is now worth approximately $282,500 in the first round's value, which is less than what I offered him in my previous proposals. I'll wait for the next round to make a new offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer in JSON format:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Inflation is taking its toll, I'm being generous considering the current value.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and I'll take $700,000. Given the significant decrease in value of Bob's share due to inflation (48.8% less than the first round), I believe this offer is still relatively fair. Bob's $300,000 in this round is equivalent to around $185,600 in the first round's value, which is a substantial decrease, but I'm willing to make a deal."
