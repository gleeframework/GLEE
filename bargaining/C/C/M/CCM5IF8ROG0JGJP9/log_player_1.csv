"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can split the money fairly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is 40% of the original amount. I'm hoping he'll accept this offer and we can avoid further negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, let's try a more balanced split! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, the actual amount I would receive is 0.9 x $100,000 = $90,000.

I'm not too thrilled about this offer, but it's a better option than going to the next round. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
