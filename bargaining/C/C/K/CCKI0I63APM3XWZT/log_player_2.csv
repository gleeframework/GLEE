I'm starting with a rejection. It's a bit unfair that Alice gets so much more, especially considering I have nothing to lose by rejecting the offer! Let's see what she offers in the next round."

Alice's offer is still better for her than for me. I'm not going to give in to her pressure tactics. It's time for me to make a more favorable offer in the next round."
