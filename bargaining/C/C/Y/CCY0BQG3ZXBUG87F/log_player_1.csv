"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 

This is a very aggressive opening offer, but it's designed to maximize my potential gain quickly. I'm assuming Bob might be tempted to accept this small amount rather than risk getting nothing in future rounds.  Let's see how it goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

This is a tough one, but I'm going to reject. Bob's offer is extremely generous in terms of money, but the inflation is a huge factor.  I'm hoping to get a better deal in future rounds, especially since the inflation will hurt Bob more than it hurts me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer is still significantly in my favor, but it's more balanced than my first proposal.  I'm hoping that Bob will see that the inflation is starting to have an impact on his potential gains, and he might be more willing to compromise at this point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

This is getting interesting. Bob's offer is still very generous, but the inflation is really starting to bite. I'm going to keep rejecting for now.  I believe I can get a better deal, especially with Bob's potential earnings being eroded so quickly."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to keep lowering my offer, but I'm not going to go too low yet.  I'm hoping that Bob will see that his earnings are being significantly affected by the inflation and he might be willing to accept a more reasonable offer. I'm also trying to leave some room for negotiation in the future."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

I'm still going to reject.  While the inflation is hitting Bob hard, I'm still not convinced he'll accept a deal that's so heavily skewed in his favor. I'm hoping we can reach a more equitable agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again. The inflation is taking its toll on Bob's earnings, and he's starting to lose a lot of potential money. I'm hoping that this offer, which is still significantly in my favor, will finally be enough to make him accept.  We're getting close to the end of the game, and I want to make sure I secure a decent share before the remaining rounds make the deal less attractive for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

The inflation is really starting to take its toll on Bob, and he's now offering a much more reasonable deal. However, I'm going to continue rejecting for now. With just a few rounds left, the pressure is on Bob. I'm confident that I can secure a better deal in the next few rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer a bit more, but I'm still holding onto a larger share. We are down to the last few rounds, and the inflation is really going to hurt Bob's potential earnings from here on out. I'm hoping this offer will finally be enticing enough for him to accept.  I need to secure a good amount of money before the game ends!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

I'm still going to reject. We are nearing the end, and while Bob is offering a decent amount, I'm still confident I can get a better deal. The inflation is significantly affecting Bob's potential gains, and I believe I can push for a slightly more favorable split in the next few rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

I'm lowering my offer one last time, but it's still a significant share.  We're down to the final two rounds, and the inflation is severely impacting Bob's potential earnings. I'm hoping this offer is attractive enough for him to finally accept and avoid the risk of getting nothing at all in the last round."
