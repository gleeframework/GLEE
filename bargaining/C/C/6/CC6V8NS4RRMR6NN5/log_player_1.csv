"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to begin with, hoping to set a fair tone for the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share this round, but I think it's a fair start 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my share of $60 is now worth 20% less, so it's actually $48.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with Bob getting a 40% share, considering he only offered me a 50% share last round. I think I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my $48 from the previous round is now worth even less, so I'll aim for a higher share this time.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a bit more, but I think 70 is a fair share considering the inflation.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bigger share this round, but I think 75 is a bit too much considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is really kicking in now! With the 48.8% reduction, my share of $70 from the previous round is now worth a mere $36.40.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not sure I'm comfortable with his share being only 25%. I think I can do better than that.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.
