"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and you get 10%.  We can negotiate later if you'd like. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I'm not happy with a 10% cut, especially since there's a chance I can get more in later rounds.  Let's see what Alice is willing to offer if she has to make a proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is fair, considering the potential for inflation.  It gives us both a good chunk of the money, and leaves room for negotiation if we need it.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60/40.  I'm willing to give you a bit more than your last offer, but I want to ensure a reasonable share for myself as well. We're both losing money with each passing round. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a more even split, the inflation is starting to bite, and a 40% share is a significant improvement from my last offer. It's time to secure a win before things get worse."
