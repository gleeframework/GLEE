Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're desperate, I can see that. But I'll give you a tiny bit more than last time 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

While far from ideal, the relentless inflation means Bob's position is rapidly deteriorating.  He's losing bargaining power with every round. Accepting even this meager offer is better than risking even worse outcomes in future rounds."
