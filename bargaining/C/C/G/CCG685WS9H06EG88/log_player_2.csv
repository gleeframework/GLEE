Let's see if Alice will be more generous in the next round!"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want a significant share. Let's end this with a perfectly even split.  This is the fairest deal we'll get. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'm taking the even split.  While I would prefer more, the inflation is hurting my gains significantly.  It's time to end this!"
