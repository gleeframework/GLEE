"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing an 80-20 split in my favor, which I think is a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try 50-50, a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 5000$ is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so it's effectively 4500$ in today's value.

I think 50-50 is a fair compromise, and I'd rather get 4500$ than risk waiting for a better offer.
