"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 70 and you can have 30. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject the offer.  While it's a fair starting point, I'm hoping to get a better deal considering the inflation and the limited rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better. I'm offering a 55/45 split in my favor. It's still a fair deal, but we both get a little more.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll try to make a better offer. I'll take 60 and you can have 40. It's still a fair split, and I'm willing to compromise. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
I'll accept the offer. While the inflation is hurting, I'm not sure if I can get a better deal with limited rounds left."
