Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to offer Bob $100,000 and keep $900,000 for myself. Since this is the first round, and I know inflation will affect me more than Bob, I want to secure a large portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more money, the inflation is going to eat away at my potential earnings quickly. Accepting this offer means I get at least something, and it's likely I'll get nothing if I keep rejecting."
