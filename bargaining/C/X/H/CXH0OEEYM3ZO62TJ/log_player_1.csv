"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This is a pretty aggressive offer, but I want to see how Bob responds. I'm aiming for a large share in the hopes of ending the game quickly, but I'm also willing to negotiate if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, I don't know what Bob's inflation situation is. It's better to accept this offer than risk getting less in the next round."
