400000.0,600000.0,"I appreciate the offer Alice, but I think we can find something more equitable. How about a 60/40 split in my favor? It accounts for the declining value, giving me a slight advantage in this round.",Bob,2,

650000.0,350000.0,"Bob, that's still heavily skewed in your favor given the inflation. I'm proposing $650,000 for me, and $350,000 for you. Let's be realistic - the clock is ticking!",Alice,3,

450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, we're getting close to a deal.  I'm willing to come down a bit.  550,000 for me, 450,000 for you. This factors in the time pressure and gives us both a decent share considering the inflation.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
600000.0,400000.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous. We're both losing out because of your greed. $600,000 for me, $400,000 for you. Take it or leave it, but the clock is ticking LOUDLY.",Alice,5,
