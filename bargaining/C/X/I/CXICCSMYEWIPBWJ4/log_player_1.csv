"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a small share, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, my gain is worth 5% less than in the previous round, so I'll have to adjust my decision accordingly.

I'm not happy with Bob's offer, as I'd like to get a larger share. I'll reject his offer and make a counter-proposal in the next round.
