I propose taking 90$ for myself, and giving Bob 10$. I want to maximize my gain in the first round, but I also need to consider that Bob might reject this offer and have the opportunity to propose a more favorable deal for himself in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While 40 dollars is something, it's significantly less than the 90 dollars I proposed in the first round.  I'm willing to take a smaller cut to ensure I get something, but I'm not going to accept this offer yet. I'll see what Bob offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm going to offer Bob 40 dollars this round. I'm reducing my share from 90 dollars to 60 dollars, which is a significant compromise. However, I believe this offer is more fair and likely to be accepted by Bob, considering he rejected my previous offer and then offered me only 40 dollars in return."
