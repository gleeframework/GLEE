"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer to divide the $10,000 and a message to Bob in JSON format:\n\n```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it 60-40""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and I'll take $6,000, with a message suggesting that this is a fair split. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a larger share, so I propose a 55-45 split in your favor. This is a generous offer considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with a 55-45 split, considering I initially proposed a 60-40 split. The inflation hasn't affected the value enough to warrant accepting this offer. I'll take my chances and make another proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5800,
  ""bob_gain"": 4200,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, 58-42 is a fair compromise""
}
```

I've decreased my initial offer by 2% to show that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still aiming for a larger share. Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out! This offer is even closer to your desired split, and the inflation is only hurting us both. Let's settle this now. 
# Alice gain: 5300 
# Bob gain: 4700 
Do you accept this offer?","```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

Although the inflation is taking a toll on the value of the money, I still believe I can get a better deal. Bob's offer is closer to my desired split, but I'm not convinced it's the best I can get. I'll take another chance and make another proposal in the next round. The pressure of time running out might work in my favor."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5700,
  ""bob_gain"": 4300,
  ""message"": ""Last chance for a good deal. Inflation is hurting us both, but I'm still willing to walk away if I don't get a fair share.""
}
```

I've increased my offer slightly from the previous round to show that I'm still willing to compromise, but I'm also emphasizing that I'm willing to walk away if I don't get a fair share. The pressure of time running out and the increasing impact of inflation might motivate Bob to accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're reaching a critical point.  My offer is a compromise. Accept this before inflation eats away at any chance of a good deal for both of us! 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

Considering the significant impact of inflation on the value of the money, I think Bob's offer is a reasonable compromise. The difference between our proposed splits is relatively small, and the risk of further inflation reducing the value of the money is too great. I'm willing to accept this offer to ensure I get a decent share, rather than risking further losses due to inflation."
