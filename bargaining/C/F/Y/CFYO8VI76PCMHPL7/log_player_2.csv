"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since this is the first round, the money hasn't depreciated yet, and I'll be considering the offer based on the original value.\n\nGiven the offer, I would reject it because it doesn't seem like a fair split to me. Alice is offering me 40% of the money, while she takes 60%. I believe a fair split would be closer to 50/50.\n\nMy response is:\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nLet's see what the next round brings!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Here's my offer for Round 2:\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\nSince the money has depreciated by 10% for me, the actual value I'm getting is $4950 (5500 x 0.9), but I'm hoping Alice will see this as a fair compromise. Let's see what she thinks!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Counter offer, slightly better for me 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the depreciation, my gain of $4200 is actually worth $3399.20 (4200 x 0.81). Given this, I still think Alice's offer is not fair, and I'll reject it. The difference in the amounts we receive is still too large, and I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round.\n\nMy response is:\n{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Reversing your offer, hoping for compromise""}\n\nGiven the depreciation, my gain of $5800 is actually worth $4698 (5800 x 0.81), but I'm trying to make a point by reversing Alice's previous offer. Maybe this will prompt her to meet me in the middle. Let's see how she reacts!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Patience is running out 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","My gain of $3800 is actually worth $2496.18 (3800 x 0.657), which is significantly less than the original value. Given the depreciation and Alice's message that her patience is running out, I'm starting to think that it's time to accept the offer. I don't want to risk getting an even worse deal in the next round.\n\nMy response is:\n{""decision"": ""accept""}"
