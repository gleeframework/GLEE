"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, I'll take the smaller share this time""}

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40. I'm willing to take the smaller share this time, hoping Bob will accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair split 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the reduced value of my potential gain due to inflation, but I'll consider Bob's offer.

After calculating the actual value of the offer, considering the inflation rates:

* My gain: 45 * (1 - 0.20) = 36
* Bob's gain: 55 * (1 - 0.05) = 52.25

I'm not convinced that this is a fair split, as I'm getting a relatively smaller share. I'll reject the offer and hope to do better in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair and equal share""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping that Bob will accept this more balanced offer."
