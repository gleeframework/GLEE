"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This is a 60-40 split in my favor, but I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll analyze Bob's offer. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll consider the actual amounts I'll receive. 

My gain of 4000 is worth 80% of 6000 from the first round, which is 4800. Bob's gain of 6000 is worth 95% of 4000 from the first round, which is 3800.

I'll reject this offer. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Now it's my turn to make a new offer. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a more balanced split. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

This way, I'll get a slightly larger share, but still a reasonable compromise. Let's see if Bob will accept this time!"
