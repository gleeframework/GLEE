"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is a relatively small share, in the hopes that he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure's on!

I'm not thrilled about accepting an equal split, but I don't want to risk going to the next round either. Considering the decreasing value of money due to inflation, I'll accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
