**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, the longer this goes on, the less favorable the split becomes for Bob due to inflation. Alice knows this and is likely to keep pushing for a larger share. Accepting now secures a less-than-ideal but still significant amount before further inflation eats into Bob's potential gain."
