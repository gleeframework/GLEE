```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. The inflation is really starting to hurt now, so I need to make a more aggressive offer to ensure I get a fair share.  It's a risk, but I think Bob might be starting to feel the pressure too."

```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. Time is running out, and I need to make a move that shows I'm serious about getting a good deal.  I'm going to offer a slightly higher amount to Bob than his previous offer, hoping he'll see it as a compromise and accept."

This is a tough decision, but with the inflation, I'm not sure I can get a better deal. I'm going to accept the offer and take the 500,000."
