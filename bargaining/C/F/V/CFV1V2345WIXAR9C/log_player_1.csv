"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering to take 600,000$ and leaving 400,000$ for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less for me, I'm now considering Bob's offer.

Since Bob's offer is 50/50, I'll accept it to avoid risking a worse deal in the next round.
