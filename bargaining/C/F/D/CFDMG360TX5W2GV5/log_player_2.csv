Round 3

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time. This offer is a compromise that acknowledges the time pressure while still being reasonable. Let's agree and move on. 
# Bob gain: 4850 
# Alice gain: 5150 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to wear me down with the threat of inflation, but her offers haven't been generous enough. I'm willing to accept a slight disadvantage due to the time pressure, but I need to hold firm to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4950,
""alice_gain"": 5050,
""message"": ""Alice, we need to settle this now.  This offer is a slight concession on my part, recognizing the time pressure. It's more than fair given the circumstances. Let's wrap this up.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  Time is running out, and each round makes the potential winnings less valuable for me. 
* **Slight Concession:** I'm willing to accept a slightly smaller share (49.5%) to get the deal done. This shows Alice I'm flexible but still want a reasonable outcome. 
* **Finality:** The tone of the message emphasizes the need to reach a deal now and avoid the risk of getting nothing."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is literally money!  This is my final offer. It's a fair deal considering the circumstances. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 4900 
# Alice gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Inflation:** The inflation is really starting to bite now. Accepting $4900 now is better than risking getting nothing and losing out on even more value.
* **Alice's Stance:**  Her ""final offer"" language suggests she's unlikely to budge further. 
* **Minimal Gains:**  Holding out for a slightly better deal isn't worth the risk of losing everything at this point."
