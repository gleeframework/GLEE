"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to get it over with. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to get the game started quickly. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not willing to give up too much 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this new offer. Considering the inflation, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can do better than a 40/60 split, especially considering the value of the money is decreasing over time. I'll wait for Bob's next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a slightly better split than before.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not willing to give up too much. Your turn again!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42/58 split, hoping Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not willing to give up too much either. Let's meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to consider this new offer. The inflation is starting to take a bigger toll on the value of the money, so I'll have to be more careful.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting this offer. A 45/55 split is a reasonable compromise, and I think it's better than risking going further into the game where the money will be worth even less. I'll take the 450,000."
