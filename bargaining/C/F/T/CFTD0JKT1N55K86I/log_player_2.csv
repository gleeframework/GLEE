Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to concede a little more, but I'm not going to give away the farm. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice's offer is getting better, but it's still early in the game. I think I can get her to go lower as the pressure of the decreasing pot gets to her.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're both losing money with each round. Let's find a compromise that benefits us both before it's too late. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

```
Alice's offer is now equal to my previous one.  I'm still ahead of her in terms of how much the inflation is impacting us, but waiting any longer is getting risky. It's better to take a decent deal now than get greedy and risk getting nothing.
