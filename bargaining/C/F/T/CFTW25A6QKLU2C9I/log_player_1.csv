"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob! You'll get a better offer next round, but you might not like the consequences.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000, and keeping $800,000 for myself. The message is a gentle nudge to consider the offer, hinting that future offers might not be as favorable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slight adjustment to the previous offer, Alice. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Considering the inflation, my gain of $700,000 in Round 2 is actually worth 95% of what I would have gotten in Round 1 ($800,000 * 0.95 = $760,000), and Bob's gain of $300,000 is worth 80% of what he would have gotten in Round 1 ($200,000 * 0.8 = $160,000).

With that in mind, I'll respond:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not quite ready to meet in the middle just yet. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting closer, Bob. Don't think you can outsmart me!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer slightly, keeping a bit more for myself while still giving Bob a decent chunk. The message is a warning that I'm not backing down easily."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm not giving up yet. I'll try to get a better deal. 
# Alice gain: 725000 
# Bob gain: 275000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking its toll!

Considering the inflation, my gain of $725,000 in Round 4 is actually worth 72.5% of what I would have gotten in Round 1 ($800,000 * 0.925 = $740,000), and Bob's gain of $275,000 is worth 137.5% of what he would have gotten in Round 1 ($200,000 * 0.938 = $187,600).

With that in mind, I'll respond:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give up that much ground, especially since Bob's gain is actually worth more than his original offer. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 5:

  ""bob_gain"": 220000,
  ""message"": ""You're running out of time, Bob. Don't expect any more favors from me!""
}
```

I'm increasing my share slightly, taking a bit more for myself while still giving Bob a decent chunk. The message is a warning that time is running out, and I'm not getting any softer."

# Alice gain: 750000 
# Bob gain: 250000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking its toll, and my gain is decreasing rapidly!

Considering the inflation, my gain of $750,000 in Round 6 is actually worth 75% of what I would have gotten in Round 1 ($800,000 * 0.9375 = $750,000), and Bob's gain of $250,000 is worth 125% of what he would have gotten in Round 1 ($200,000 * 0.625 = $125,000).

  ""alice_gain"": 820000,
  ""bob_gain"": 180000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting desperate, Bob. Better take it before I change my mind!""
}
```

I'm increasing my share again, taking a bit more for myself while giving Bob a smaller chunk. The message is a warning that I'm not getting any softer, and Bob should take the offer before I reconsider."

# Alice gain: 800000 
# Bob gain: 200000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll now!

Considering the inflation, my gain of $800,000 in Round 8 is actually worth 80% of what I would have gotten in Round 1 ($800,000 * 0.8 = $640,000), and Bob's gain of $200,000 is worth 100% of what he would have gotten in Round 1 ($200,000 * 0.8 = $160,000).

With that in mind, I'll respond:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think I've squeezed Bob enough, and it's time to take the deal. The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, and I don't want to risk losing out on a decent share."
