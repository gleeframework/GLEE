I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor.  I figure this is a fair starting point, as I'm only taking a slightly larger share, and it gives Bob a chance to get something.  Let's see how he responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is ridiculous! He's trying to turn the tables completely. I'm not going to let him get away with that.  I'll make my own offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I'm going to reduce my offer slightly to 850,000 for me and 150,000 for Bob. This is still a significant advantage for me, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate. Bob needs to realize that he's not going to get 900,000, and he's starting to lose value on his side with each round.  Let's see if this is more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being increasingly unreasonable! While I'm losing value too, he's losing more, and still trying to get the lion's share. This offer is unacceptable. I'm not going to give in to his greed. I'll try to make a more reasonable offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm making a final concession to 700,000 for me and 300,000 for Bob. I'm losing value rapidly, and it's becoming increasingly clear that Bob is being unreasonable.  This is my last offer, and if he rejects it, I'm prepared to walk away with nothing.  Let's see if he finally comes to his senses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation, offering me a ridiculously small share.  I'm not going to give in to his greed.  At this point, I'm losing more value than he is, but it's better to walk away with nothing than to accept such a grossly unfair deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split.  At this point, both of us are losing significant value with each round.  We are both better off accepting this offer and ending the game, rather than risking losing everything. This is my final offer."
