"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 55-45, a fair deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 450,000$ and keeping 550,000$ for myself. I think this is a fair split, but I'm open to negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual amounts I'd gain in this round are:

* My gain: 500,000 * 0.9 = 450,000 (10% less than the original 500,000)
* Bob's gain: 500,000 * 0.95 = 475,000 (5% less than the original 500,000)

I don't think this is a good deal for me, as I'd be getting less than I would have in the first round. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me at 60-40, it's a fair compromise!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself. I think this is a reasonable compromise, considering the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I want more! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts I'd gain in this round, considering the inflation:

* My gain: 400,000 * 0.727 (1 - 0.273) = 291,080 (27.1% less than the original 400,000)
* Bob's gain: 600,000 * 0.8586 (1 - 0.1414) = 513,516 (14.26% less than the original 600,000)

I'm not getting a good deal in this round, as I'd be getting significantly less than I would have in the first round. I'll reject this offer.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5

  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""Compromise on 42-58, it's a fair split!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share, hoping to find a mutually acceptable agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting desperate, but I'm not giving up yet! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts I'd gain in this round, considering the inflation:

* My gain: 300,000 * 0.5945 (1 - 0.4055) = 178,35 (40.95% less than the original 300,000)
* Bob's gain: 700,000 * 0.7778 (1 - 0.2222) = 543,46 (22.62% less than the original 700,000)

I'm not getting a good deal in this round, as I'd be getting a tiny fraction of what I would have in the first round. I'll reject this offer.

}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, hoping that Bob will accept this offer."
