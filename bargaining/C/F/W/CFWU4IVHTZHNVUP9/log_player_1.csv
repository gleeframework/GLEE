"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to start with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept quickly and avoid any potential inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While the offer is tempting, I believe I can do better. Even though I have less money due to inflation, I can still make a more favorable deal in future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm offering a slightly lower amount to Bob than his previous offer, but still significantly more than the initial round. I believe this will encourage him to accept before inflation further reduces the value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to a 50/50 split than the previous rounds, I'm still not satisfied. My potential earnings are decreasing rapidly with inflation, but I believe I can still secure a better deal in future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering a compromise this round, aiming for a deal that is closer to a 60/40 split in my favor.  With inflation rapidly decreasing the value of the money, I need to secure a favorable deal sooner rather than later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While the offer from Bob is significantly better than the previous round, I'm still not satisfied with the current situation. The inflation is hurting my potential earnings drastically, but I believe I can secure a better deal in future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

With inflation rapidly eroding the value of the money, I propose a 50/50 split. This is a fair and reasonable solution considering the circumstances."
