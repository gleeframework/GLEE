"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, to see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started with 50/50, I'll take a slightly more aggressive approach this time 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, I need to consider that my gain of 4000 is worth 20% less than the initial 5000, so it's effectively 4000 / 0.8 = 5000.

I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I'll consider it. Since I'm not getting a better offer, I'll accept Bob's proposal this time.
