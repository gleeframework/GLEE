{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start fair. I propose we split the money 60/40 in my favor. This way, we both get a decent amount, and we can avoid the risk of inflation.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit too much in your favor, Alice. How about we meet closer to the middle? This way we both still get a good deal before inflation eats away at it too much. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
