"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. This way we both get a decent amount.""
}
```

I'm proposing that we divide the $1,000,000 60-40 in my favor, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think it's still a good deal. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less in this round, I'm not as eager to accept a smaller share.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think I can do better than 30% of the remaining value. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money due to inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""This way, we're both getting a decent share, and I'm willing to compromise.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42-58 split, which I think is a reasonable compromise. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think I deserve more given the current market conditions. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, the value of the shares is decreasing rapidly. I'm not willing to accept a share that's as small as 20% of the remaining value.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think I can do better than 20% of the remaining value. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money due to inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 360000,
  ""bob_gain"": 640000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I still want a decent amount for myself.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 36-64 split, which I think is a reasonable compromise given the current market conditions. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
