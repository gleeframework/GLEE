"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, I'm giving you a good deal! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While it's a decent offer, Bob should hold out for more. He has all the leverage in the first round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm feeling generous, but let's be fair. This is a better deal for both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, meet me halfway, the money is losing value for you! 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While Bob could potentially get more, the money is losing value quickly. This offer is a good compromise and ensures Bob gets something before the inflation eats away at his potential gains further."
