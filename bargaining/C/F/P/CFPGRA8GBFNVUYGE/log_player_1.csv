"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000
}
```

This way, I'll get 75% of the original $1,000,000, and Bob will get 25%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth less for both of us, but Bob's offer is still quite generous. I'll accept his offer.
