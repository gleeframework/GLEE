"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can negotiate from here""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself, which is a 60-40 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You said it's a fair split, I'll try it out 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me, my gain of $6,000 in the first round is now equivalent to $4,800 in this round. Bob's gain of $4,000 is now equivalent to $4,000, but since it's worth 10% less for him, it's equivalent to $3,600 for me.

I don't think this is a good deal for me, especially since Bob is trying to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth less for me.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, my gain is now worth 40% less than in the first round. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to compensate for the inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You're trying to take advantage of the inflation, I'll take control""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You think you're taking control, but I'm still in the driver's seat 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the equivalent values in the first round:

My gain of $7,000 in round 3 is worth 52.2% of the original $6,000, so it's equivalent to $3,132 in the first round. However, due to the 48.8% reduction in value, it's now equivalent to $1,607.

Bob's gain of $5,500 in round 4 is worth 55% of the original $4,000, so it's equivalent to $2,200 in the first round. However, due to the 27.1% reduction in value, it's now equivalent to $1,600.

This offer is actually a good deal for me, considering the reduced value of the money. I'll accept it.
