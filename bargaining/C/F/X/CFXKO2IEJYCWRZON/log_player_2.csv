"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair.  I'll take the lion's share this time, but I'm open to a more even split later. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

It's risky to accept such a lopsided deal so early in the game.  There's a chance I can get a better offer later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's be a little more reasonable. This is a fair starting point, and we can adjust as we go.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not going to give up more than I have to. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Alice is being more reasonable, and I'm not sure I can do much better with the inflation. It's time to take a deal."
