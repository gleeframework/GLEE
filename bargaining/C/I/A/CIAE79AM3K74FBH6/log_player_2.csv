"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's get this done quickly. 10 dollars is better than nothing next round. 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd rather take my chances and make a counteroffer in the next round. 10 dollars seems too low, and I'm hoping to get a better deal despite the inflation risk."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 40, ""alice_gain"": 60, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering the inflation, I think this is a fair offer.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The longer this takes, the less appealing your share becomes. I suggest we end this now. 
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI still think I can get a better deal. Although the inflation is taking its toll, I'm willing to take the risk for at least one more round to try and get closer to what I consider fair."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 37, ""alice_gain"": 63, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation is starting to bite, I'm willing to compromise a bit more. Hopefully, this is closer to what you're willing to accept.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. This is already round 5, and the value for you keeps shrinking. 30 dollars now is better than an even smaller amount later. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nGiven the increasing impact of inflation, I think accepting this offer is the most pragmatic decision. The difference between what I'm offered now and what I might get in future rounds is likely to be negligible, and further delay only benefits Alice. It's time to cut my losses and accept the 30 dollars."
