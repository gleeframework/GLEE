Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle.  Fair is fair. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to be taken advantage of.  Let's come to an agreement before things get worse. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Even with inflation, Bob's offer is getting worse for me.  I need to hold out for a better deal, but time is running out. I need to find a balance between getting a larger share and the risk of getting nothing if we don't reach an agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""This is my final offer, Bob. It's more than fair, and the clock is ticking for both of us.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm applying more pressure now. By framing this as my ""final offer,"" I'm hoping Bob will see the urgency and understand that further negotiation might lead to a worse outcome for him.  The split is still in my favor, but I'm acknowledging that we need to reach an agreement soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're both losing money with each round.  Let's settle on a deal that's more favorable to me, but still allows us to walk away with something. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough one. Bob is right, we're both losing out, and this offer is starting to get tempting. However, accepting such a low amount sets a bad precedent, and Bob might think I'm desperate. I'll gamble one more round and hope he's willing to negotiate a fairer deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. We both lose if this drags on. I'm meeting you in the middle. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  With only 5 rounds left, the pressure is mounting. I need to signal that I'm serious about reaching an agreement now.
* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm conceding by matching his previous offer.  While it's not ideal after inflation, it shows flexibility and a desire to end the negotiation.
* **Firm Language:**  ""Take it or leave it"" conveys urgency and finality. Bob needs to understand I'm not bluffing and further stalling will hurt us both."
