"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,
  ""message"": ""I propose we divide the money with a 75/25 split. This allows us to share the wealth while ensuring both of us benefit.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  This reflects the decreasing value of the money with each round, and it's a fair starting point for negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
