"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair deal, Bob.  I'll take the lion's share, but you'll still get a decent chunk. 
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
This is a bad deal for Bob.  While it's tempting to take something, it's important to consider the future rounds and how the inflation will affect the value of the money.  It's likely that Bob can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
