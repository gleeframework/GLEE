"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

This is my offer for the first round. I'm taking a large share since the money doesn't depreciate for me yet, and I want to see if Bob is willing to accept a smaller share early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It's better to accept this offer than risk going to the next round and getting nothing. Even though the money is depreciating for Bob, he's offering a 50/50 split, which is a fair deal considering we have limited rounds."
