"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I propose that Alice gets $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000. 

This is a high initial offer for Alice, but it ensures a good start and avoids immediate conflict. We'll see how Bob reacts to this proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more, it's likely Bob will continue to drive down the price in subsequent rounds. Accepting this offer ensures I get a decent amount while the value is still relatively high. It's better to secure some money now than risk getting nothing later."
