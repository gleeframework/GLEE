Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 70,
""alice_gain"": 30,
""message"": ""Your offer was a bit unfair to me.  I'm proposing a 70/30 split instead. Think carefully, the value decreases with each round!""}

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I understand you want more. Let's try a 40/60 split. If you reject this, the next round will be even worse for me, and probably not worth your while either. 
# Bob gain: 60 
# Alice gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
