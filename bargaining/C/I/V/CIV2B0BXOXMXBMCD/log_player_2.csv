Alice's offer:

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out!  This deal is still better than anything you'll get in later rounds. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm sticking to a fair deal. 55/45 reflects the decreasing value over time. Let's close this out.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm meeting you in the middle.  This is the last round I'm offering more than 55%! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, accepting a 40/60 split is the most logical choice for Bob. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:** The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for Bob. Waiting longer means getting even less.
* **Alice's Stance:**  Alice has been consistently aiming for a larger share.  Her offer of 60/40 in round 2, and her statement about not going higher than 55% in future rounds, suggest she's unlikely to budge much. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Holding out for a slightly better deal in later rounds is incredibly risky. If the game goes to round 12, Bob gets nothing. 

While a 40/60 split isn't ideal, it's better for Bob to secure something now rather than risk getting nothing.
