"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split, which is a fair and straightforward proposal. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 4000, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual values are:

Alice gain: 4000 / 0.9 = 4444.44
Bob gain: 6000 / 0.95 = 6315.79

I'm not thrilled about the offer, but it's still a decent proposal. I'll accept it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
