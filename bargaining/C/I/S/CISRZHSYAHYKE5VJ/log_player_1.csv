{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's start fair.  I propose we split the money 60/40, with me taking the larger share.  I think this is a good starting point for a fair and efficient division.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 80/20 is a more reasonable split, considering the money's decreasing value with each round. I'll take the larger share this time, but I'm willing to negotiate further if you're not satisfied. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
