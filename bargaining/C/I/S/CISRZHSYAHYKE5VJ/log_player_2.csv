Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 8000, ""alice_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""I think 80/20 is a more reasonable split, considering the money's decreasing value with each round.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split the money equally this time. I'm not interested in haggling anymore, and a 50/50 split seems like the fairest option given the current inflation rates. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000
