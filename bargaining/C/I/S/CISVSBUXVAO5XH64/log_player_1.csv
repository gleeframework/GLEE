"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a 95/5 split in my favor. This is a fair starting point considering the inflation dynamic. We can adjust as the game progresses, but I'm confident this is a good first step. 
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95
