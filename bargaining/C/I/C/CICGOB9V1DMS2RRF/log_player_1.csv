Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, my turn. Let's be realistic, time is money. This offer heavily favors me, but it's a good starting point for you to counter. Keep in mind the significant inflation we both face. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
