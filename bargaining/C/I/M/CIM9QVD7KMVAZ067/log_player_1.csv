"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me and 10% less for Bob, my gain of 8000 in the first round is still worth 8000, but Bob's gain of 2000 in the first round is now worth 1800.

Bob's current offer is 5000 for me and 5000 for him, which is a better deal for me than his previous offer, but worse than my initial offer.

I accept this offer.
