Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Take this offer or I'm walking away. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing tough, but time is working in my favor. While her offers are getting marginally better, the devaluation of the money for me means I need to push for a much better deal. Holding out longer puts more pressure on her to offer a significant amount or risk getting nothing."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 525000,
""alice_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. I'm standing firm on a fair split. This offer leaves us both with a significant sum.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  We're past the halfway point.  Alice's resolve is likely strengthening, but the increasing devaluation hurts me more each round. 
* **Strong Stance:**  I need to project firmness without being overly aggressive.  A slight decrease from my previous offer shows flexibility but not desperation.
* **Appeal to Logic:**  Framing it as a ""realistic"" and ""fair split"" aims to plant those ideas in Alice's mind."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer. Take it or leave it. We're running out of time and I'd rather walk away with something than nothing. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** We're down to the wire. With only 5 rounds left, the risk of getting nothing is very real. 
* **Alice's Stance:**  Her language (""final offer,"" ""walk away"") suggests she's not budging further.
* **Devaluation Impact:** Holding out for a marginally better deal might not be worth it considering the money's rapid devaluation.  

While not ideal, accepting this offer guarantees a significant sum.  Rejecting it at this stage is a gamble with potentially severe consequences."
