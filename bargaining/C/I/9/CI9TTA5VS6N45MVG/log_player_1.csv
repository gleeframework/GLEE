"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, then we can reassess in the next round.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm suggesting we re-evaluate our proposal in the next round based on the current inflation rate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share this round, but I'm hoping to increase my share in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gain being worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gain being worth 20% less, I'll have to be cautious.

I'll reject this offer since I'm not getting a fair share, considering the inflation rate. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation rate and the previous round's rejection, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share this round, but I'm hoping to adjust the ratio in my favor in future rounds.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, giving Bob a slightly smaller share than before, while still keeping a significant portion for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm holding firm on my share, but willing to give you a slightly smaller share than last round. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the significant decrease in the value of Bob's share due to inflation, I'll have to reevaluate my decision.

Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll accept Bob's offer this time, hoping to reassess and adjust in future rounds.
