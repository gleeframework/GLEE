I'm going for a big chunk of the money, hoping Bob will take it and we can end this quickly.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

Even with the inflation, getting half the money is a good deal compared to the first round.  It's better to take what I can get now and avoid the risk of another round."
