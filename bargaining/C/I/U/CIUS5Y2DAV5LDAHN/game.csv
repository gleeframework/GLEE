,,"While I understand your perspective, Bob, that offer is still too far from a fair split for me. Let's find a compromise.",Alice,2,reject
5100.0,4900.0,"Okay, Bob, how about a compromise?  Slightly less for me than my first offer, recognizing the time pressure, but still a reasonable split.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4200.0,5800.0,I'm increasing my share to account for the decreasing value. Let's wrap this up before it's worth even less!,Bob,4,
,,"This is getting ridiculous, Bob. I'm offering fair deals, and you're just getting greedier with the shrinking pot.  I'm willing to negotiate, but not be taken advantage of.",Alice,4,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Bob, this is getting us nowhere. I'm proposing a perfectly even split. Take it or leave it - but further attempts to exploit the situation will be met with a hard 'no'.",Alice,5,
