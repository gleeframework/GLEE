**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting better, but it's still heavily skewed in her favor considering the inflation working against her.  With each passing round, the value of the money decreases significantly for Alice, while it remains constant for me. I'm willing to take a slight hit to ensure I get a larger share in the long run. It's time to apply a bit more pressure."
