Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer was reasonable considering the situation. However, I'm confident we can find a more mutually beneficial agreement. How about a 52/48 split in my favor? 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 48, ""bob_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but a 52/48 split still feels unfair given the inflation factor. Let's meet in the middle at 50/50. It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both benefit from ending this game.""}
