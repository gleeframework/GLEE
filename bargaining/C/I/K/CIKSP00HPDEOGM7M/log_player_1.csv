"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

This is a 50/50 split, a fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll reject this offer. My gain of 4000 is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, due to the 10% inflation. I'd rather wait for a better offer. 

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my new offer, taking into account the 20% inflation since the first round:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3600,
  ""bob_gain"": 6400
}
```

This offer is a bit more skewed in my favor, but I'm still willing to compromise. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on my potential gains!

After considering Bob's offer, I'll reject it. My gain of 4500 is worth significantly less than my gain of 5000 in the first round, and I'm not convinced it's the best deal I can get.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my new offer, taking into account the 30.1% inflation since the first round:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3000,
  ""bob_gain"": 7000
}
```

This offer is even more skewed in Bob's favor, but I'm trying to be realistic about the decreasing value of my potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really eating away at my potential gains!

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll accept it. My gain of 5800 is worth significantly less than my gain of 5000 in the first round, but it's still a better deal than my previous offers, and I don't want to risk going to another round with the inflation continuing to erode my potential gains.
