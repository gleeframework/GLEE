# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make another counteroffer. Alice's gain is now worth significantly less due to inflation, so I can try to negotiate an even better deal.

# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer. Since Alice said this is her final offer and we'll both walk away with nothing if I reject it, I'm calling her bluff.
