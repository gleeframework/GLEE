"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering you $100,000, and I'll take the remaining $900,000. The message is a bit aggressive, but I'm hoping it'll get you to accept quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take a smaller cut, Alice! It's still a generous offer! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'd like to get a bit more to compensate for the decrease in value. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was for $800,000 and I want to get a bit more due to inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Better than your last offer, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering you $300,000, and I'll take the remaining $700,000. Let's see if you'll accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting greedy, Alice! Meet me in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll consider Bob's offer more carefully. Meeting in the middle sounds like a reasonable compromise, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer that's a bit more aggressive, considering the decreasing value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You can do better than that, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering you $450,000, and I'll take the remaining $550,000. Let's see if you'll accept this one!"

Round 6

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, Alice. It's only fair! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","A 50/50 split sounds like a reasonable proposal, especially considering the decreasing value of the money. It's not the most generous offer I've received, but it's a fair one.
