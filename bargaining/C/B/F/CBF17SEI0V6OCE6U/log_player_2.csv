Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's try again.  I'm willing to come down to 70% for me, 30% for you. This takes into account the inflation, and hopefully we can reach a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70
