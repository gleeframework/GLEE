"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. I'm aiming for a large portion, but I still want to incentivize Bob to accept the offer in the first round.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While a 50/50 split seems fair on the surface, I'm not willing to accept it just yet. Remember, inflation is eating away at my gains.  I need to push for a better deal, especially since I'll be the one making the proposal in the next round. Let's see if I can negotiate a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to offer a 70/30 split in my favor.  I'm trying to find a balance between maximizing my share and ensuring Bob doesn't get completely frustrated."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is becoming increasingly unfavorable for me. Bob's offer is significantly lower than the 50/50 split he proposed in round 2, even though inflation is hurting me more than it's hurting him. I'm not going to settle for such a low share, and I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal in the coming rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor.  I'm trying to find a middle ground where I get a good share, but I also don't want to push Bob too far and risk him rejecting the offer again.  This time, the inflation should be factored in, making my offer more attractive for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not going to accept this offer!  Bob's offer is still significantly lower than the 50/50 split he proposed in round 2, and the inflation is hitting me hard.  I'm going to push for a better deal in the next round.  The pressure is on!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

I'm offering a 55/45 split in my favor. This is a compromise, acknowledging the significant inflation I've faced, but also trying to offer Bob a reasonable share to avoid another rejection.  It's getting risky, but I think this might be the sweet spot."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is getting increasingly ridiculous!  Bob is offering me a significantly lower share than his previous offer, and I'm facing even more inflation. I refuse to accept such a bad deal.  I'll try my best to get a better offer in the next round.  The pressure is mounting!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm going for a 50/50 split.  We are both losing a lot of money due to inflation.  This is the best we can hope for.  It's a risk, but I believe this is the best chance for both of us to get something out of this."
