"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Take it or leave it, Bob. I'm feeling generous. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible offer! While $1,000 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can negotiate a much better deal for myself.  Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Alice. This split reflects our positions in the game.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try a fairer split this time, Bob. I'm willing to compromise. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is better than her first offer, but still heavily favors her.  It seems like she's trying to take advantage of the inflation working against me. I need to push for a more equitable split, even if it means risking a few more rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm serious about getting a fair deal. This offer is a compromise, and I'm not going lower.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. Let's end this game with a decent split. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice is sticking stubbornly to her advantage, and the inflation is increasingly hurting my position. While I'd prefer a 50/50 split, accepting her offer of 40/60 now is better than risking getting a worse deal (or nothing at all) as we get closer to the deadline."
