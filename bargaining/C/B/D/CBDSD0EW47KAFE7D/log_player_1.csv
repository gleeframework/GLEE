"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a very lopsided offer, hoping Bob will be more reasonable in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
It's a fair offer, and I don't want to risk losing more money due to inflation."
