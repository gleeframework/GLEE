"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI'll offer Bob $400,000 and keep $600,000 for myself, with the message ""Let's divide fairly"". Waiting for Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm aiming higher this round.  Let's make a deal! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer since I would be losing a significant amount compared to the previous round, and the inflation rate affects me more than Bob. It's my turn now.\n\n###\n\nMy new offer for round 3 would be:\n{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $450,000 and keep $550,000 for myself, with the message ""Meet me in the middle"". Waiting for Bob's response."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $450,000 and keep $550,000 for myself, with the message ""Meet me in the middle"". Waiting for Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out! This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on my potential gain, which is now worth 48.8% less than in the first round, and the fact that Bob's offer has improved from the previous round, I'll accept this offer. The difference in the amounts we gain is not as significant as the potential loss from further inflation. It's better to secure $400,000 now rather than risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds."
