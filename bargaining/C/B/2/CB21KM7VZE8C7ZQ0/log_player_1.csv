"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point!""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, a fair start! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 50-50 split, but since Bob is willing to compromise, I'll accept this offer.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
