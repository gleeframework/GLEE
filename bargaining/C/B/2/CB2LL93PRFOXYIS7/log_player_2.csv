Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Don't worry about inflation, Bob. 57-43 and we can both walk away happy! 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

It's painful, but at this point, the inflation is killing Bob.  While accepting a less-than-ideal split, taking Alice's offer results in *something* rather than risking a worse outcome in future rounds as the value of Bob's potential gain continues to plummet."
