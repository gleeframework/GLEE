"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90%, you get 10%. We can negotiate from here. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While a 1000$ is tempting, I want to see if I can get a better deal!  Let's see if Alice is willing to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is a fairer starting point. Let's work together to find a solution we both agree on.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but let's stick to a 55/45 split for now. We can adjust it further if necessary. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a bit more, a 4500$ gain is still a good outcome, especially considering the inflation. It's better to secure something than risk getting nothing."
