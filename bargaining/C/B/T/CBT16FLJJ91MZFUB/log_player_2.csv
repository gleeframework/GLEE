Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is slowly moving towards a more even split, time is working against her far more than me. It's still beneficial for me to hold out for a better deal.  The longer this goes, the more desperate she'll become, and the more favorable a deal I can secure."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Let's stop wasting time, Alice. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both benefit before inflation eats away at everything.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a 50/50 split this time. This serves several purposes:

* **Fairness:** It shows Alice I am willing to compromise and find a solution that benefits both of us equally.
* **Urgency:** By framing it as a way to avoid losing everything to inflation, I'm increasing the pressure on Alice to accept. 
* **Future Leverage:** If she rejects this offer, it demonstrates her unwillingness to compromise and puts me in a stronger position for future negotiations."
