"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself. The message is a friendly one, inviting Bob to consider a fair split of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth less after inflation, I'll have to adjust my decision accordingly.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

Meeting in the middle seems like a reasonable proposal, and it's better than risking going into more rounds with decreasing value."
