Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI'll offer Bob $4000 and keep $6000 for myself, with a message suggesting a fair split. Let's see if Bob accepts!"

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering you'll have to deal with inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince I'm playing as Alice, I will respond with a decision. Given the adjusted values due to inflation, I'll have to consider the impact on my gain. However, considering it's just the second round and the deal might not get better for me, I'll make a decision.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI choose to reject Bob's offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round or make a counteroffer that might sway Bob. The game is on!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll try to find a middle ground, taking into account the inflation and Bob's previous offer. Since the money is worth 10% less for me in each round, I need to be strategic about my offer.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet halfway""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $4500 and keeping $5500 for myself, highlighting the impact of inflation and suggesting we meet halfway between our previous offers. Let's see how Bob responds!"
