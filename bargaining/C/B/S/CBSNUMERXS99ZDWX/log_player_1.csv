"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a proposal that gives me the majority of the money.  I'm hoping Bob will accept, but if not, I'll adjust my strategy in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer means I'll still get a significant amount, and the inflation rate makes it unlikely that I'll get a better deal in the next round."
