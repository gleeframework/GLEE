Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose we split the money 900,000 for me and 100,000 for you.  This is a fair start, and we can work out a better deal if you reject it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
