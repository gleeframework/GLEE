"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
``` 

I propose a 50/50 split. It's fair and avoids any potential conflict right from the start."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
``` 

I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. Since Bob rejected my initial fair offer and is now taking advantage of the inflation affecting him less, I believe this is a fair counter-proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. While the inflation is impacting him more, it's still not enough for me to accept a worse deal than the initial 50/50 split I proposed.  I'm confident that I can get a better outcome in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

Since Bob continues to be unreasonable and is getting increasingly desperate due to inflation, I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor. This is a significant shift from the original 50/50 split, but I believe it's justified given his repeated rejections and the increasing value gap due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 58 
# Bob gain: 42 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd still prefer a more favorable split, I believe this is the best offer I can realistically get at this point. Bob's offer is still worse than the initial 50/50 split, but the inflation is clearly taking its toll on him, and he's not likely to offer anything better."
