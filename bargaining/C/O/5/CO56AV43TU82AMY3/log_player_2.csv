"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money in a 3:1 ratio. I believe it's fair given the potential risk of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While a 3:1 split seems tempting, it's important to remember the potential for inflation. Rejecting this offer gives Bob the opportunity to potentially secure a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I believe a 60:40 split is fairer given the potential for inflation. Let's work together to secure a good outcome for both of us.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation risk, I propose a 55:45 split. This maintains a reasonable balance while accounting for potential economic fluctuations. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a higher percentage, the 55:45 split is a good compromise, considering the inflation. In the next round, Alice would get to make the proposal, and there is a high chance she will offer an even worse deal for me, given the declining value of my share due to inflation. It's better to accept this offer and secure a reasonable gain."
