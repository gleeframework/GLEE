"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
I propose keeping 90% of the money for myself and giving 10% to Bob. This is a pretty aggressive opening, but since the money will lose value more quickly for Bob, I'm hoping it's enough to incentivize him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred a higher share, the money is losing value quickly, and I'm not confident I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
