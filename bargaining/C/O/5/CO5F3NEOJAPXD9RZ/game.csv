,,,Bob,1,reject
200000.0,800000.0,"I'm willing to give you a decent chunk, but I think I deserve more. This is my best offer.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Considering inflation, I've adjusted our proposal to a 45/55 split. I believe this is fair given the diminishing value of money. Please let me know what you think.",Alice,3,

400000.0,600000.0,I'm still not satisfied with the split. I think I deserve more considering the value of the money has decreased even further. This is my revised offer.,Bob,4,
