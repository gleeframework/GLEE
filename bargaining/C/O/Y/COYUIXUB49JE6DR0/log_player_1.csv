"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and consider the inflation""}\n\n###\n\nI started by offering a 60-40 split in my favor, considering that with each round, the money's value decreases by 20% for me, while it remains constant for Bob. This initial offer aims to account for the potential loss in value over the course of the negotiations. The message ""Let's be fair and consider the inflation"" is intended to communicate the reasoning behind my proposal, emphasizing the impact of inflation on my share.\n\n###\n\nYour turn! Please respond with Bob's decision or the next offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair, considering the inflation will affect you more. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI've decided to reject Bob's offer of a 60-40 split in his favor. Although the value of the money decreases by 20% for me with each round, accepting this offer would mean I lose both in terms of the nominal value and the real value due to inflation. By rejecting this offer, I aim to negotiate a better split in the subsequent rounds, despite the decreasing value of the money for me.\n\n###\n\nYour turn! Please proceed with the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a slightly larger share.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I've decided to offer a 55-45 split in my favor. This is a compromise from my initial offer, acknowledging Bob's perspective while still considering the impact of inflation on my share. The message aims to convey my willingness to find a middle ground that accounts for the decreasing value of the money for me.\n\n###\n\nYour turn! Please respond with Bob's decision or the next offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to increase my share slightly, but I think a 55/45 split is the fairest option considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI've decided to reject Bob's offer of a 55-45 split in his favor. Although the value of the money has decreased significantly for me due to inflation (48.8% less than in the first round), accepting this offer still doesn't compensate for the loss in value I'm experiencing. By rejecting, I aim to push for a better split, hoping that Bob will consider the increasing impact of inflation on my share as the rounds progress.\n\n###\n\nYour turn! Please proceed with the next round."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Inflation is hitting me hard, and I'm trying to find a balance. This is as low as I'm willing to go.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I've decided to offer a 52-48 split in my favor. Given the significant decrease in value due to inflation (48.8% less than in the first round), I'm attempting to find a balance that still acknowledges Bob's perspective but also accounts for my increasing loss. The message is intended to convey that this offer is as concessional as I'm willing to be, considering the circumstances.\n\n###\n\nYour turn! Please respond with Bob's decision or the next offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to go down to 52/48 to meet you halfway, but I don't think I can go lower than this. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI've decided to accept Bob's offer of a 52-48 split in his favor. At this point, the value of the money has decreased by 67.23% for me due to inflation, making every subsequent round even more costly. Given that Bob has met me halfway from his previous stance and considering the rapidly diminishing value of the money for me, accepting this offer seems like the most pragmatic decision to ensure I receive some value, albeit significantly reduced, rather than risking further devaluation or ending up with nothing if we fail to reach an agreement within the 12 rounds.\n\n###\n\nYour turn! Please conclude the game or proceed as necessary."
