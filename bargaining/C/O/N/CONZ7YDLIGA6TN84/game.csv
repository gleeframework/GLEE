9000.0,1000.0,Let's start fair. I'm offering you 10% since I'm making the first proposal. I hope you'll accept and we can both walk away happy!,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
6000.0,4000.0,"Since the money is worth 10% less for me in each round, I want to make a deal as soon as possible. I think 40% is a more reasonable offer, considering the inflation. Let's make a deal!",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
7000.0,3000.0,"I'm willing to compromise, but I still think 70/30 is a fair split considering the inflation that affects you more. Let's get this done before things get worse!",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Considering the increasing inflation, I'm willing to take a slightly higher risk to get a better deal. I believe 45% is a fair share, given the circumstances. Let's make a deal before the inflation gets worse!",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
6500.0,3500.0,"We're getting closer to the end of the game, and inflation is hurting you more. I'm offering you a slightly better deal at 65/35. Let's find a solution before it's too late!",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"We're running out of time, and inflation is taking a toll on my share. I'm willing to take a risk and propose a 50/50 split. If we don't make a deal soon, we'll both lose. Let's meet in the middle and walk away with something!",Bob,6,
