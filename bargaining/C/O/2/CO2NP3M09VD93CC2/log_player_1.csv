This offer is a bit cheeky, but it sets the stage for negotiation. I'm aiming to take almost everything, knowing Bob is likely to reject this and make a counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a huge improvement from Bob's perspective, but I'm not going to settle for just 200,000. I'm going to counter with a more balanced offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split. This seems fair, considering the inflation and the fact that Bob has already made a significant concession. I hope he'll accept it and we can end the game."
