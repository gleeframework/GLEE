"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20, a fair start""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000, leaving Bob with 20%. I'm framing it as a fair and generous starting point, hoping to set a positive tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, no need to be greedy 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

Considering the offer, I think I'll reject it. I'd rather aim for a higher share to compensate for the loss in purchasing power due to inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Compensate for inflation, still fair""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to take a slightly larger share, trying to account for the 20% decrease in value due to inflation. I'm framing it as a fair offer, hoping Bob will see it as a reasonable compromise."
