""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer is heavily skewed in your favor. Let's be realistic - I'm proposing a 65/35 split. This is a chance for you to secure a significant sum before inflation erodes its value further.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise and offer a 60/40 split. This way, we both get a good amount, and we can avoid further losses from inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```
Reasoning:

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in Round 3 makes sense for Bob due to the following:

* **Inflation Impact:**  The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for Alice, making her more likely to accept a less favorable deal as time goes on. However, this doesn't impact Bob. 
* **Guaranteed Return:** Accepting a 60/40 split guarantees Bob $400,000.  Rejecting this offer carries significant risk. If Bob fails to secure a better deal in subsequent rounds, he could end up with significantly less.

It's a compromise, but given the circumstances and the impact of inflation on Alice, accepting is a logically sound decision for Bob.
