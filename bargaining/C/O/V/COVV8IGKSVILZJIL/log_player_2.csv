"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. Take 10, I'll take 90.  We can work out a better deal later if you want. 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give up some of my share, but 50/50 is still too much for me.  Let's split it 70/30, and we can both come out ahead. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice is still being too greedy. I'll take my chances with my own offer next round."
