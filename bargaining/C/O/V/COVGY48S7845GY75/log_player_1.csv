"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Accept and we can split the difference""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60 dollars and leaving 40 dollars for Bob. My message is a friendly suggestion that we can split the difference, implying that we can negotiate and find a mutually beneficial solution."
