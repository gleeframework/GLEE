"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose to take $9,000 and Bob takes $1,000. This gives me the majority of the money, but still offers Bob something. I hope he accepts so we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I would prefer to have more money, I think it's better to accept this offer. The inflation means Bob is losing a significant amount, and if I reject this, we'll likely end up with less than this in the end.  It's a good deal for me considering the circumstances."
