"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, Bob!""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $4,500 and keeping $5,500 for myself. It's not an equal split, but I'm hoping the message ""Let's be fair, Bob!"" will persuade him to accept the offer. Let me know what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, Alice. It's a fair deal, and we can both walk away happy. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting Bob's offer of an even split, even though it seems fair. Since the money is worth 5% less in this round, I'd be getting $4,750 in ""real"" value, whereas in the first round, I would have gotten $5,500. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round or negotiate a better offer. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 5250, ""bob_gain"": 4750, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob!""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $4,750 and keeping $5,250 for myself. Since the money is worth 5% less in each round, I'm trying to find a middle ground that is closer to the original offer I made in Round 1. The message ""Meet me in the middle, Bob!"" is an attempt to persuade him that this is a fair compromise. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
