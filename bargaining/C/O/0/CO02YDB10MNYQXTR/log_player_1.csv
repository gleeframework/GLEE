"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, giving me $60 and Bob $40. My message to Bob is that this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping he'll accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the lead, let's try 3/4 to me and 1/4 to you 
# Alice gain: 25 
# Bob gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, I'll have to think carefully about the inflation factor. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 5% less, I need to consider the relative values.

However, I'm not convinced by Bob's offer. I think I can do better. I'll reject his offer and make a counter-proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not convinced by your offer, I'll make a counter-proposal: 50/50!""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept my counter-proposal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. I'll make a new proposal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, let's split it 55/45""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, giving me $55 and Bob $45. My message to Bob is that I'm willing to compromise and meet him halfway, hoping he'll accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll try to squeeze a bit more, 4/5 to me and 1/5 to you 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob is really pushing for a bigger share!

Considering the inflation factor, I need to take into account that Bob's gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, which means his gain is worth around 71.74% of what it was in the first round. Meanwhile, my gain is still worth the same as in the first round.

However, I'm not thrilled about the 4/5 to 1/5 split. I think I can still do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with that big of a gap, I'll make a counter-proposal: 52/48!""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept my counter-proposal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","It's my turn again. I'll make a new proposal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 51,
  ""bob_gain"": 49,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting close to my limit, let's try 51/49""
}
```

I'm proposing a 51/49 split, giving me $51 and Bob $49. My message to Bob is that I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still willing to compromise and try to find a mutually acceptable solution."
