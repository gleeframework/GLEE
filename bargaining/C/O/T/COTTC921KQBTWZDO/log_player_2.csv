"Round 1

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I think we should aim for a more even split. This offer accounts for the time value of money.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejecting Alice's offer:** Alice's initial offer heavily favored her. While it might seem tempting to accept $4,000, rejecting it sends a signal that I'm aiming for a fairer outcome.
* **My offer (Round 2):**  
    * I'm proposing a slight majority for myself ($5,500) to account for the fact that the value of the money decreases for me with each round.  
    * My message emphasizes fairness and subtly introduces the concept of the time value of money, hoping Alice will be receptive to a more balanced deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, my offer is more generous than it seems 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing a clever game, framing her offer as generous due to inflation. However, her offer is actually getting worse for me! 

* **Round 1 equivalent:** Alice's $4,200 offer in Round 3 is actually worth significantly less than her $4,000 offer in Round 1 due to the 19% inflation. 
* **Holding my ground:** I need to show Alice that I'm not falling for her framing. Rejecting this offer maintains pressure and signals that I'm serious about a fairer deal. 

I'm hoping that by Round 4, Alice will realize that lowballing me won't work, and she'll be more open to a truly balanced split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5100,
""alice_gain"": 4900,
""message"": ""Let's be realistic. Time is important for both of us. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging time pressure:** By Round 4, it's clear that Alice is aware of the inflation mechanic. My message directly addresses the time pressure, making it a shared concern rather than just my problem.
* **Strategic compromise:** I'm slightly lowering my ask from Round 2 ($5,500 to $5,100). This shows a willingness to negotiate while still securing a slight advantage to offset some of the inflation.
* **Emphasis on fairness:** I'm highlighting the ""fairness"" of the offer. By now, Alice has likely calculated that dragging this out further will only lead to less favorable offers from me due to inflation.  

This offer creates a strong incentive for Alice to accept. It's a reasonable compromise that prevents further losses for both of us due to the time pressure."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, my offer is getting less generous 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

I'm at a breaking point.  Here's why:

* **Significant inflation:** The 34.39% inflation is eating substantially into my potential gains. Continuing to hold out is getting riskier.
* **Alice's shifting strategy:**  Alice is no longer even trying to frame her offers as fair. She's openly acknowledging that her offers are getting worse, putting pressure on me to accept before they decline further. 
* **Diminishing returns:** Even if I reject this offer and manage to secure a slightly better deal in the next round or two, the inflation will have eroded much of the potential gain. It's unlikely future offers will offset the losses I've already incurred. 

This is a tough pill to swallow, as Alice is getting a much better deal. However, accepting now cuts my losses and ensures I receive something rather than risking an even worse outcome if I continue to play her game."
