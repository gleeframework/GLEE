"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need for haggling""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take a bit more this time 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, I need to be more cautious about the value of the money. Since Bob's offer is 6000, I'll need to consider the effect of inflation.

My gain of 4000 is worth 90% of what it was in the previous round (100% - 10% inflation), so it's effectively 4500 in value.

Bob's gain of 6000 is worth 95% of what it was in the previous round (100% - 5% inflation), so it's effectively 5700 in value.

Considering this, I'll reject the offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll try to adjust my offer to account for the inflation. Since my gain is worth 90% of its original value, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the loss in value.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to keep up with inflation""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're still shortchanging me, I need more to keep up with the economic downturn 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the effective value of the gains in this round.

My gain of 4500 is worth 72.9% of its original value (100% - 27.1% inflation), so it's effectively 7290 in value in the first round.

Bob's gain of 5500 is worth 85.74% of its original value (100% - 14.26% inflation), so it's effectively 8574 in value in the first round.

Considering this, I'll reject the offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll try to adjust my offer to account for the further inflation. Since my gain is worth 72.9% of its original value, I'll aim to get an even larger share to compensate for the loss in value.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit less, but I need to protect my share""
}
