"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started with a fair offer, but I can do better! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting counteroffer from Bob! 

Since the money is worth 5% less due to inflation, the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: $500,000 x 0.95 = $475,000
Bob gain: $500,000 x 0.95 = $475,000

I'm not sure I like this proposal as much as my original one, but I'm willing to consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to get a bit more. Your turn, Bob!""
}
```

I'm trying to get a slightly better deal for myself, while still being reasonable. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging on the ratio, but I'm willing to give you less overall. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is catching up!

Since the money is worth 14.26% less due to inflation, the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: $400,000 x 0.8574 (1 - 0.1426) = $343,696
Bob gain: $600,000 x 0.8574 = $514,440

I'm not thrilled about this proposal, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of time running out. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll try to hold out for a better deal, but it's getting tough!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit desperate, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm trying to get a slightly better deal for myself, but I'm also trying to be reasonable. Let's see if Bob will meet me in the middle!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to think you're not serious about negotiating. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob is getting tough!

Since the money is worth 22.62% less due to inflation, the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: $300,000 x 0.7778 (1 - 0.2222) = $233,340
Bob gain: $700,000 x 0.7778 = $544,740

I'm not thrilled about this proposal, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of time running out. I'm not sure if I want to hold out for a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the deal, but I'm not happy about it!"
