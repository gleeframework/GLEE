Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting very close, but with each round, the potential loss gets higher if we don't reach an agreement. I'll hold out a bit longer to see if I can edge out a slightly better deal.  Time pressure is a factor now for both of us."

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

It's time to accept.  While I'd prefer a slightly higher amount, the difference is now relatively small.  Continuing to push risks getting nothing at all, which would be a far worse outcome than accepting this offer."
