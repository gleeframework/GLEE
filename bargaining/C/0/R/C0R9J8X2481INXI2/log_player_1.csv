"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial $100, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider the offer. Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 10% less, I need to adjust my thinking accordingly.

I'll reject this offer because I think I can do better. I'll wait for the next round. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Now it's my turn again. Considering the inflation is still affecting Bob's gains, I'll make a new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

This way, I'm increasing my share slightly to account for the decreasing value of Bob's money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","With the increasing inflation affecting Bob's gains, I'll reassess the offer. Since my share is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the relative value of Bob's offer.

I'll accept this offer because it seems like a reasonable compromise, given the changing value of the money.
