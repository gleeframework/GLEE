50.0,50.0,Let's start fair and split the money evenly. What do you say?,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
40.0,60.0,My turn. How about a 60/40 split in my favor?  It's still a good deal for you before inflation eats away at the value.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
65.0,35.0,"I'm willing to go up to 65 for myself, but I think it's only fair that we split the remaining amount evenly. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
45.0,55.0,"This is getting ridiculous. I need to make up for the inflation.  I'll take 55, you take 45.  Final offer.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
50.0,50.0,"Look, the inflation is hurting both of us.  Let's just split it evenly and call it a day.  We're both losing money with each round.  We're better off just settling.",Alice,5,
