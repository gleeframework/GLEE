# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more, but I'm trying to be fair. Your turn to decide! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
Even though inflation has hit me hard, I'm better off accepting Bob's offer. If I reject, I risk getting nothing in the next round due to the rapid inflation. This is the best I can do right now."
