Let's see what I can get!  I'll make a counter-offer next round."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a 60/40 split in my favor. It's a fair deal, considering the inflation risk!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'll take it.  With the inflation, this is a better deal than I could get in the next round."
