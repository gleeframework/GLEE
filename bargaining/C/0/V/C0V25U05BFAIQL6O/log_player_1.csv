Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 60:40 is a more reasonable split considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
