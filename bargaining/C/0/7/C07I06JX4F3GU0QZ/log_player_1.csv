Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going for a fairly aggressive first offer, aiming for 90% of the money. I think Bob will likely want to negotiate, but it's important to establish a strong starting position.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I would prefer more,  I believe it is in my best interest to accept Bob's offer.  He has made a fair counter-offer, and with the inflation, waiting for another round might not yield a better result."
