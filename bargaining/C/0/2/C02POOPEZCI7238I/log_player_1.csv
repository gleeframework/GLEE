I'm going to offer Bob a small amount to start.  I figure this will be enough to make him accept, especially since he doesn't know how the inflation will affect him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob is getting more aggressive, but I still think I can do better. I'm going to reject his offer and see if he'll be more reasonable in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8500, ""bob_gain"": 1500}

I'm going to offer Bob a slightly higher amount than he offered me in the last round.  I think this will be enough to make him accept, and I'll still get a good chunk of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7500 
# Bob gain: 2500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. The inflation is starting to hurt Bob more than me, and it's likely he'll be getting more aggressive in the next round. I'll take what I can get now."
