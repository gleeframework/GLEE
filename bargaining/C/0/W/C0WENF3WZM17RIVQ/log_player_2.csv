Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly playing a waiting game, hoping I'll cave under the pressure of inflation.  While 4400 is tempting, accepting now sets a bad precedent and she'll likely push for even less in future rounds. It's risky, but I need to hold firm."
