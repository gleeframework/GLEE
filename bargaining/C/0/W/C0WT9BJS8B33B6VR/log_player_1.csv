"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly smaller share, but I'm willing to negotiate. Your turn to respond! 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: 600,000 x 0.8 = 480,000
Bob gain: 400,000 x 0.8 = 320,000

I'll accept Bob's offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
