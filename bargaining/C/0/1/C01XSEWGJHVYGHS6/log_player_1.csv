"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I propose a 900,000/100,000 split. This gives me the majority of the money, but also allows Bob to get something. I believe this is a fair starting point, considering the inflation that will occur in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, Bob's offer is a fair 50/50 split. Given the inflation, accepting this offer guarantees me at least half the value of the original amount.  It's better to secure a decent share now than risk getting less in future rounds."
