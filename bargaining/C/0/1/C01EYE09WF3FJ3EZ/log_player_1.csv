"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but still keep a bit more 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money is worth less after inflation, I'd like to get a better deal. Bob's offer is a slight improvement, but I'd like to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a slight improvement, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's even better. I'll aim to get a bit more, but not so much that Bob will reject it.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4800,
  ""bob_gain"": 5200,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you in the middle, but I'm not giving up much more""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not getting any closer to my ideal split 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on my potential earnings. I'll think about Bob's new offer...

Considering the reduced value of money, I'd like to get a bit more, but I'm not sure if I can push for more. Bob's offer is still a bit too skewed towards his side.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of money and the fact that Bob's previous offer was still a bit skewed towards his side.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4600,
  ""bob_gain"": 5400,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not giving up my end of the deal""
}
