"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 

I'm starting with a fairly generous offer, hoping to secure a quick deal and avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer.  While it's tempting to get something rather than nothing, the inflation is making the potential gains in later rounds more valuable. I want to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to 80/20, but still offering a significant portion to Bob. I'm hoping this will be more appealing than his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting. Even though the inflation is starting to bite, I believe I can get a better deal by continuing to play. I'm hoping Bob will eventually realize that a 20/80 split is not very beneficial to him in the long run."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still hoping to get a deal done. The inflation is starting to be a serious concern, but I'm confident that I can get a better split than Bob's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting. The inflation is really starting to hurt, but I'm sticking to my strategy. I believe that Bob will eventually realize that he needs to offer me more to get a deal done before the value of the money gets even lower."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

The inflation is getting serious now.  I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still trying to secure a deal with a decent share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting.  The inflation is taking a heavy toll, but I think I can still get a better deal. Bob seems to be pushing for a larger share, but I believe I can convince him to compromise a bit more."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

The inflation is getting out of hand. I'm offering a 50/50 split, which is fair given the circumstances. I'm hoping Bob will realize that continuing to play is risky and that we both stand to lose a lot more if we don't come to an agreement."
