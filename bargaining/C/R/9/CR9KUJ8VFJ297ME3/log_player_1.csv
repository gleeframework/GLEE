"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

I propose to take 9000$ for myself and leave 1000$ for Bob. This seems fair as a starting point, and I hope Bob will accept this offer to avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get more, it's better to accept this offer. Inflation means my potential gains in future rounds are reduced significantly. This offer ensures I get at least half the remaining money, which is better than risking getting nothing at all."
