"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the $100 and Bob gets 40%. I think this is a fair starting point, and I hope Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bigger share, but I think 70 is still a bit too much 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about the 30% share, and I think I can do better. I'll reject this offer and hope to get a better deal in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 80 is the minimum I can accept""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the $100, which is a slightly more aggressive offer than before. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in giving me a bigger share, but I'm still leaving some room for compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think 75 is still a bit too high 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about the 25% share, and I think I can do better. Considering the inflation, I'm starting to get a bit concerned about the value of the money, and I'm not willing to settle for such a small share. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15, ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, but I think 85 is the maximum I can accept""}

I'm proposing that I get 85% of the $100, which is a very aggressive offer. I'm trying to be realistic about the value of the money at this point, and I'm willing to take a risk to get a bigger share. I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm making a strong push for a bigger share and will be willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting desperate too, but I think 90 is still a bit too high, let's meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 90 
# Bob gain: 10 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm not thrilled about the 10% share, but considering the extreme inflation and the fact that we're both getting desperate, I think this is the best offer I'm going to get. I'm willing to accept this offer and take the 90% share, hoping that it's enough to make it worth my while."
