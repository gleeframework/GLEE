"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Alice, my turn!  I'm feeling more ambitious this round.  Let's make a deal - this offer gets us both a good chunk of change.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:** The money is losing value fast for Bob. It's crucial to secure a deal quickly.
* **Power Shift:** Rejecting Alice's offer puts Bob in the proposer's seat, giving him a chance to steer the deal.
* **Fairness:**  While the initial offer wasn't terrible, Bob can aim for a slightly more favorable split while still being reasonable. 

The message aims to be persuasive without being aggressive, emphasizing the benefits to both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. This offer is the best you'll get considering the inflation working against you. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Exploitation:** Alice is clearly trying to leverage the inflation against Bob. While her offer isn't terrible in absolute terms, it's significantly worse than her first offer, showing she's willing to push for a much larger share.
* **Time Pressure:** While the pressure is on Bob, Alice is also feeling the effects of inflation, even if it's at a slower rate. Delaying further hurts both parties.
* **Last Chance:**  Bob has to make a strong stand now. If he rejects this offer, he's essentially betting that Alice will offer something better in the next round to avoid losing even more value.

By rejecting again, Bob signals his resolve and forces Alice to reconsider her aggressive stance."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4800,
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time. This offer is fair and avoids both of us losing out further. It's time to close the deal!""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Push:**  This offer is Bob's last strong play. It's slightly better for him than Alice's last offer, reflecting the increasing pressure on her as well. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** The message stresses the need to finalize the deal quickly. The longer they wait, the less everyone gains.
* **Appeal to Fairness:**  While tilted in Bob's favor, the offer is presented as a reasonably fair split, especially considering the circumstances.

This offer aims to be a compelling compromise for Alice. It's unlikely she'll secure a significantly better deal in the next round, given the rapid inflation affecting Bob's potential gains."
