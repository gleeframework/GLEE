Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a very uneven split. I figure Bob might be tempted to accept this, as he's getting something, and I don't know how the inflation will affect him. If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, this is a fair offer in the face of inflation. I'm not sure how much the inflation affects Bob, but I'm guaranteed half the money now, which is better than potentially getting less in the next round."
