"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
``` 
 
I propose to keep $9,000 for myself and give Bob $1,000.  I'm taking a large share because I'm the one making the offer first, and I want to see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
Even with the 20% inflation, taking $5,000 is better than getting $8,000 (9000 * 0.8) if I reject and then Bob decides to be stubborn and make another 50/50 proposal. It's also a fair offer, and I don't want to risk losing more money in the next round."
