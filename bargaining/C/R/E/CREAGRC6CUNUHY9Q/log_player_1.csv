I'm proposing a 900,000/100,000 split in my favor. This gives me the majority of the money, but still allows Bob to get something. I'm hoping he'll accept this in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is much worse than my initial proposal, even considering the inflation. I'll reject and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm still aiming for a majority share, but I'm willing to give Bob a little more this time. I'm hoping he'll be more agreeable after his last offer was rejected."
