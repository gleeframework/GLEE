"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a pretty generous offer to Bob in the first round. I'm hoping he'll accept, but if not, I'll adjust my offer in the next round to account for the potential inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even with the inflation, Bob's offer is still fair. It's a 50/50 split, and it's better than risking another round and potentially losing more money due to further inflation."
