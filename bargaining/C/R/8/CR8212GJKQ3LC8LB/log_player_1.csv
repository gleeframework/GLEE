"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor, but I'm open to negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm not being too generous yet! 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure's on!

I'll reject Bob's offer for now. I'd like to try to get a better deal.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, so I'll have to be careful with my offer.

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. Let's make a deal!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to get a bit desperate, but I'll try to be fair again. Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is getting a bit more generous!

Considering the rapidly decreasing value of the money, I think it's a good idea to accept this offer. We can both get 50$ and be done with it.
