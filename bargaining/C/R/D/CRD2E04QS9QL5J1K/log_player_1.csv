"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split. We both get a good chunk of the money, and I'm willing to compromise to avoid further inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
