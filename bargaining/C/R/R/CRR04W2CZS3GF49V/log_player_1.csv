"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}

I'm going for a classic 90/10 split in the first round. This is a pretty aggressive offer, but it sets the stage for negotiation and allows me to see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer is the best option in this round.  Inflation means my potential gains are shrinking rapidly, and if I reject this offer, I have no guarantee I'll get a better deal later.  It's time to prioritize getting something rather than holding out for a larger share."
