"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this and we can go grab a coffee!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000, which is a generous offer, but I'm keeping the majority of the money for myself. The message is just a friendly one to try to get Bob to accept the offer quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, it's the fairest deal! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since Bob's gain is worth 10% less than in the previous round, he's essentially offering me 9,000 (10,000 - 1,000) - 10% = 9,000, which is more than my original offer.

However, I'm not sure if I want to split it evenly, as it would mean I'd be giving up 5,000, which is a significant amount.

For now, I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need to keep a bit more to make it worth my while.""
}
```

I'm keeping a bit more than in the previous round, but still offering Bob a decent amount. The message is a gentle nudge to see if Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. I'm willing to give you a decent amount, but I need to get a fair share too. Let's end this negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rate of 27.1%, Bob's gain is now worth 72.9% of what it was in the first round. This means he's offering me 7,290 (10,000 - 2,710) dollars, which is a significant decrease from my original offer.

However, I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, as I'm still keeping 6,000 dollars, which is a decent amount. But I'm not sure if I should push for more, considering the inflation.

For now, I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to get a better deal than this.""
}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly, trying to get a bit more than Bob's last offer. The message is a gentle push to see if Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my last attempt at a fair compromise. Let's find a solution before we both lose everything! 
# Alice gain: 6500 
# Bob gain: 3500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rate of 40.95%, Bob's gain is now worth 59.05% of what it was in the first round. This means he's offering me 5,905 (10,000 - 4,095) dollars, which is a significant decrease from my original offer.

Considering the inflation, I'm not sure if I should push for more, as the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. However, I'm not convinced that this offer is fair, especially since I've been trying to negotiate for a better deal.

For now, I'll reject the offer and try to think of a new strategy.

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit desperate, but I'm still not willing to give up too much. Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly, trying to get a bit more than Bob's last offer. The message is a bit more urgent, trying to convey that I'm not willing to give up much more."
