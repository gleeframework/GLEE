# Alice's message: Accept this and we can go grab a coffee! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's a little early to accept such a lopsided offer. There are 12 rounds and the money is worth less each time, so I'm going to try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, it's the fairest deal!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need to keep a bit more to make it worth my while. 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
I'm still holding out for a better deal. I know that the money is worth less with each round, but I'm willing to take the risk to get a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000, ""message"": ""This is my final offer. I'm willing to give you a decent amount, but I need to get a fair share too. Let's end this negotiation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to get a better deal than this. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While the offer is tempting, I'm still holding out for a better deal.  We're nearing the halfway point of the rounds, and my leverage is weakening, but I'm hoping to secure a more favorable split before the inflation bites too deeply."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 3500, ""alice_gain"": 6500, ""message"": ""This is my last attempt at a fair compromise. Let's find a solution before we both lose everything!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting a bit desperate, but I'm still not willing to give up too much. Meet me in the middle, Bob! 
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm starting to feel the pinch of the inflation, and I'm not sure I can get a better deal. This is a decent offer, and it's better to secure something than risk losing everything."
