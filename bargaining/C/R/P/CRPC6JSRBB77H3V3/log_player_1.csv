"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a moderate offer. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'd like to get a bit more to compensate for the decrease in value. I'll reject this offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher share this time. Here's my new proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6500,
  ""bob_gain"": 3500
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the increased inflation, my share is worth significantly less than before. I'll consider Bob's offer carefully. Since my share is decreasing rapidly, I'll take this opportunity to accept the offer before things get even worse.
