"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need for further negotiations""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair and straightforward way to divide the money. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 400k, it's a good deal, don't be greedy! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not going to take the bait with this offer. I think I can do better than that.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the fact that Bob's offer was a bit low.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you halfway, but I'm not going to give away more than 55% of the pie""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give away more than 55% 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to stick to his 55% limit. I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that I should accept this offer, especially since the value of Bob's gain is decreasing with each round due to inflation. I'll try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make another offer, trying to get closer to my initial target of 55% of the pie.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 525000,
  ""bob_gain"": 475000,
  ""message"": ""I'll compromise a bit, but I think I deserve a bit more than 45% of the pie""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
