I'm starting with a pretty generous offer for Bob, hoping he'll accept and we can both get something.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, I'm worried that if I reject, the next round will be even less favorable for me.  I'll take the 80 and hope for the best."
