"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This is a fairly standard 60-40 split, giving me a significant majority of the money while still leaving Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $5000 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, so I'll have to adjust my expectations.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
