  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game."

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to take advantage of the situation!

I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a pretty big difference. I'm not willing to give you 60% of the total. Let's try again!""
}

  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 58% is a bit too much for you. Let's meet in the middle?""

# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is sticking to his guns!
