"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I receive $8,000 and Bob receives $2,000, which seems like a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60-40 is a more balanced split.  Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll!

Considering the reduced value of money, I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that 60-40 is a fair split, especially considering the reduced value of money. I'd like to see a more even split or a higher share for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer, taking into account the 20% inflation:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's make it work!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which I think is a more balanced and reasonable compromise, considering the reduced value of money."
