"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a decent share, but I think 4:1 is too extreme. This 6:4 split is a fair compromise considering the current value of money. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
