"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's offer was 40-60, I'll try to counter with a similar ratio, but with a slight bias towards myself. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Alice's offer is the same as mine in round 2, but considering the inflation, the actual amounts are slightly different. Since the values are now 36% and 19% less, I'll recalculate the amounts:

Alice's offer: Bob gets 45 * 0.64 = 28.8, Alice gets 55 * 0.81 = 44.55

I'll stick with my original offer from round 2, as it's still more favorable to me.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, the money is now worth even less. Here's my new offer:

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}"
