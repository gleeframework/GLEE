Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation more than Bob, and her offers are slowly getting more reasonable. However, it's still early in the game, and accepting a 43/57 split in Round 5 would set a bad precedent. Bob can afford to hold out a bit longer and see if Alice will offer a more favorable split in the next round."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. The inflation is hurting both of us. I propose a 50/50 split to end this fairly before we lose more.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Offering a 50/50 split at this stage accomplishes a few things:

* **Appears Fair:** It presents Bob as reasonable and willing to compromise, which might sway Alice. 
* **Time Pressure:**  It highlights the increasing losses due to inflation, pushing Alice towards a quicker resolution. 
* **Sets a Baseline:** Even if Alice rejects this offer, it establishes a psychological anchor for future negotiations, making splits heavily favoring Alice less palatable."
