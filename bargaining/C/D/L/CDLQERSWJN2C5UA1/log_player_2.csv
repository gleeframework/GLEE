Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic.  50/50 is not fair with the inflation working against you more than me.  This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Time is running out and the effects of inflation are becoming severe. While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer of $4,500 is better than risking getting nothing if we continue to hold out for a 50/50 split.  It's a bitter pill, but the alternative is likely worse at this point."
