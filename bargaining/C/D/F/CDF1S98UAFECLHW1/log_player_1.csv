"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly.  This way, we both get a good chunk and can avoid the risk of inflation eating away at our gains. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
