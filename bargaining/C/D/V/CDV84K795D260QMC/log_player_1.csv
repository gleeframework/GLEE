"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}

This way, I get the majority of the money, but still leave Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain is now worth even less. I'll have to be more careful with my decisions. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better deal.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll aim to get a larger share this time. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}

This way, I'll get a bigger chunk of the money, but Bob will still get a smaller portion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain. I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering the reduced value of my gain, I'll accept Bob's offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
