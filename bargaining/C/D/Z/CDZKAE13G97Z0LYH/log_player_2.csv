"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI can do better than that! Let's see what the next round brings."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's try a 55/45 split in my favor. It's only fair I get a bit more since I'm taking the risk of the money being worth less in the next round.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time. It's getting risky with the inflation, and I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to avoid losing more money. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nI think a 50/50 split is a fair offer, considering the inflation. It's better to secure this amount now rather than risking a further decrease in value."
