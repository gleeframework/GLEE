"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

This is a 50/50 split, which seems fair to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I still have the same amount to gain, but for Bob, the money is worth 20% less. This means that in terms of actual value, Bob's gain is 4800$ (6000 * 0.8).

Considering this, I'd like to reject the offer. I'd rather wait for a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account that the money is worth 0% less for me and 20% less for Bob compared to the previous round.

Since Bob's offer in round 2 was 4000 for me, which is equivalent to 5000 in the first round, I'll offer 4500 for myself, which is equivalent to 5500 in the first round.

Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual value of Bob's gain in the first round, which is 7000. Since the money is worth 48.8% less due to inflation, we need to multiply 7000 by 0.516 (1 - 0.488). This gives us 3603.2.

Considering this, I'd like to reject the offer. I'd rather wait for a better deal.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account that the money is worth 0% less for me and 48.8% less for Bob compared to the first round.

Since Bob's offer in round 4 was 3000 for me, which is equivalent to 3750 in the first round, I'll offer 3375 for myself, which is equivalent to 4250 in the first round.

Here's my proposal:

  ""alice_gain"": 3375,
  ""bob_gain"": 6625

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual value of Bob's gain in the first round, which is 7500. Since the money is worth 67.23% less due to inflation, we need to multiply 7500 by 0.323 (1 - 0.6723). This gives us 2429.25.

Considering this, I'd like to reject the offer. I'd rather wait for a better deal.
