"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

This offer reflects a belief that Bob might be willing to accept a relatively small portion to avoid risking getting nothing at all if he rejects my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I believe that I can still get a better deal. While Bob is losing value due to inflation, I am not. I'll try to negotiate a higher share in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5} 
```

I'm raising my share slightly to 95%, hoping that Bob will see this as a better offer than the previous round and take it, considering his losses due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 85 
# Bob gain: 15 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is getting better for me with every round due to inflation.  While I'd prefer more, I'm not sure I'll get a better deal with only a few rounds left. Accepting now seems like the best option."
