Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.

Alice is barely budging and we're losing money fast. I'm hoping she'll become more reasonable soon."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:

This is getting too risky.  While I'd prefer a better split, accepting now guarantees a decent amount of money before inflation eats away at it further."
