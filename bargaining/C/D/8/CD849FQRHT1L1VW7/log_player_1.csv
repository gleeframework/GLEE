Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a 900,000 - 100,000 split. I'm assuming Bob will be hesitant to reject this offer, as it's a pretty good deal for him, and he knows that if he does reject it, he'll be the one making the offer next round, and I will then have the chance to take a much bigger share due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While it's tempting to try and get more, considering the inflation effect, the 500,000 is a good deal for me. Even though I'm losing a bit of money due to inflation, Bob is also losing some, so this is a fair split.  It's better than risking further inflation and potentially getting an even worse deal."
