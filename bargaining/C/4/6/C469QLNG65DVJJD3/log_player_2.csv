"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, but I get a little extra to account for inflation over the next few rounds. 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
It's worth holding out for a better deal.  While Alice's offer is fair, I can likely get a bigger share by waiting and making my own proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a fair share, but I need a little more to account for the inflation that will affect me more in the later rounds."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is getting ridiculous.  Let's just split it evenly and call it a day. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, the risk of getting nothing is too high at this point.  Accepting the even split ensures I get something, and Alice's offer is becoming less appealing with each round due to inflation."
