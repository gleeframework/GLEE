"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where each of us gets $5000. This is a reasonable starting point, and I hope Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but still a decent share for you! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with Bob's offer. He's trying to take a larger share, and I'm not willing to accept a 2:3 split. I'd like to make a counteroffer to try to get a more equal split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but still a decent compromise""}

I'm proposing a 55:45 split, which is a bit more in my favor than the initial 50:50 split, but still gives Bob a decent share. I hope this compromise will be more acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly larger share, but not too generous 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer. Although he's given me a slightly larger share, I'm still not satisfied with the 48:52 split. I think I can do better. I'd like to make another counteroffer to try to get a more equal split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
