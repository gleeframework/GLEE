"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

This is a risky move. I'm offering Bob a small portion of the money, hoping he'll accept to avoid the risk of getting nothing in later rounds.  I'm banking on his greed and fear of losing out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my initial offer.  I'm still hoping to get a better deal.  If I accept, I'm essentially giving up 8000 dollars, and inflation will only make that loss worse in the future.  It's better to risk it and see if we can reach a more equitable compromise."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to 8000, but still offering Bob a reasonable portion. The inflation is hitting hard, so I need to ensure I get a good deal while also avoiding a stalemate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse, and the inflation is starting to bite.  It's still a loss for me, but I'm determined to hold out for a better deal.  There's still time to negotiate, and I believe a fairer split is achievable."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but it's still a more favorable split for me than what Bob offered.  I'm getting desperate, but I still think I can get a better deal than this.  This is a gamble, but I'm willing to risk it to see if Bob will budge."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a tough one. Bob's offer is still significantly worse than what I would like, and the inflation is really starting to hurt. But, with only 6 rounds left, I'm worried that if I reject this offer, Bob might just push me to the brink and we'll both end up with nothing.  I'm going to take a gamble and see if I can get a slightly better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm taking a huge risk here. Inflation is really biting now, and I'm offering Bob a larger share than before.  But, I'm hoping that this signals my desperation, and he'll finally agree to something closer to a fair split. We only have a few rounds left, and I'm willing to take a gamble."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is pushing his luck. While his offer is getting closer to a fair split, the inflation is hitting hard, and this deal still represents a significant loss for me.  I'm hoping that with only four rounds remaining, he might realize that he needs to compromise to avoid losing everything.  I'm willing to risk it and see if I can get a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm going all-in for a 50/50 split. It's the fairest outcome considering the inflation we've both been experiencing.  I'm hoping Bob will finally realize that he's pushing his luck and agree to this. If he rejects, it's a risk for both of us, but I'm willing to take it to secure a fair share.  The stakes are too high to accept anything less."
