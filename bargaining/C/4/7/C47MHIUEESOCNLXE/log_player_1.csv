"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, a fair start""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $10,000 and Bob gets 20%. I think this is a fair starting point, considering we both have the same amount of information and no one has any leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, 50/50 seems reasonable,  no need to get greedy!  
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about the 50/50 split, especially since my money is worth 20% less now. I think I can do better. I'll reject this offer and hope to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""You're getting closer, but I still think I deserve more""}

I'm adjusting my offer to reflect the decreased value of my money due to inflation. I'm proposing a 60/40 split, which is a slight improvement from the 50/50 split Bob offered earlier. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to compromise and meet me halfway."
