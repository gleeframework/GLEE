"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. My message is a friendly one, suggesting we can split the money fairly and avoid any further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You said it was fair last time, so I'm offering a 50/50 split. Accept this and we can end the game. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to negotiate a fair split after all.

I accept Bob's offer for a 50/50 split. My gain would be $5,000, and I'm willing to compromise to end the game.
