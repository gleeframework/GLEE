# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll meet you halfway between my last offer and yours, let's make a deal 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, time is running out. Accepting now means losing a significant chunk of the initial amount to inflation.  We need to push for a better deal, but we also need to be mindful that an agreement has to be reached soon."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5100, ""alice_gain"": 4900, ""message"": ""Alice, this is a very reasonable offer. We're running out of time, and I want us both to benefit. Let's close the deal.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency:**  With only 6 rounds left, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. A deal needs to be struck soon.
* **Slight Advantage:** This offer still gives Bob a slight advantage while being very close to an even split.
* **Final Push:**  This sends a clear signal that Bob is willing to negotiate but won't accept a significantly smaller share."
