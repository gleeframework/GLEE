# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out and the money is losing value fast, especially for you. This is a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but this is the best I can do. Let's close the deal before the money loses even more value. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Reason: While not ideal, accepting 40 at this stage is better than risking getting a worse offer later, considering the rapid inflation impacting my potential gains."
