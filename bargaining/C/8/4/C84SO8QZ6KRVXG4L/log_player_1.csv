"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

I propose that Alice receives $9,000 and Bob receives $1,000.  This seems like a fair starting point, given that Bob has the advantage of no inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

Given that Bob rejected my previous offer and has the advantage of no inflation, I propose a slightly lower offer for myself: $8,000 for Alice and $2,000 for Bob. This ensures a larger share for me while acknowledging Bob's leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

Although I'm facing significant inflation, I believe it's still possible to negotiate a decent outcome. My offer of $6,000 for Alice and $4,000 for Bob reflects the continued pressure of inflation, but still leaves some room for compromise."
