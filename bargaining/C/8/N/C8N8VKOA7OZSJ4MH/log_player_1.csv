"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

This offer gives me a 60/40 split in my favor, but it's still a reasonable starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept it to avoid the risk of inflation in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than what I had in Round 1, it's still not fair considering inflation.  I'll reject and see what happens in the next round.  It might be worth it to wait and see if Bob is willing to offer me more."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'll propose a 50/50 split. Considering the inflation, I'm not willing to accept anything less. Hopefully, Bob will see that it's in his best interest to accept this offer rather than risk having to offer me even more in the next round."
