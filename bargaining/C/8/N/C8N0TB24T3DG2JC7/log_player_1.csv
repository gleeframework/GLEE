"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

I propose to take 9000 dollars and leave 1000 dollars for Bob. This is a relatively fair split considering we have many rounds left.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse than mine from the previous round, and I know the money is worth less now due to inflation.  I'm not going to accept this. I'll counter in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8500, ""bob_gain"": 1500}
```

I'm lowering my share a little bit to 8500, but I'm still keeping a good chunk of the money. This reflects the fact that I lost some value due to inflation.  Let's see if Bob is willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse with each round. Even with the inflation, I'm not going to settle for such a small share.  I'll propose something better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7500, ""bob_gain"": 2500}
```

I'm lowering my share again to 7500, but I'm still trying to secure a significant portion of the money. The inflation is starting to bite, but I'm hoping Bob will see the value in reaching an agreement before things get even worse for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still way too low, even considering the inflation. I'm not going to accept this. I'll propose something better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm making a final push to get a good deal.  I'm lowering my share to 7000, but I'm still holding out for a significant amount of the money. The inflation is really hitting hard now, but I think Bob will see the value in reaching an agreement soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still way too low, even with the massive inflation hitting him.  I'm not going to accept this. I'm going to fight for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm making a final push to get a good deal.  I'm lowering my share to 6000, but I'm still holding out for a significant amount of the money. The inflation is really hitting hard now, but I think Bob will see the value in reaching an agreement soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 61.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While Bob's offer isn't what I initially wanted, the inflation has taken a huge toll on both of us. It's a 50/50 split now, which is fair considering the circumstances. Accepting this means we both get something, and it's better than risking getting nothing at all in the remaining rounds."
