"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'll let Bob know if he wants to accept or reject it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 10% less, the numbers are now:

Alice gain: 200,000
Bob gain: 800,000

I'm not thrilled about the uneven split, but I think it's a fair compromise. I'll accept the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
