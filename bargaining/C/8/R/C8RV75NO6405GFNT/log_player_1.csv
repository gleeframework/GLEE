I'm starting with a fairly generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept. I'll be keeping 90% of the money, but giving him 10% is still a decent amount.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is way too low for me.  While the money is worth less this round, I'm still better off waiting until next round and making a new offer.  There's a good chance I can still get a much better deal than this."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 810000, ""bob_gain"": 190000}
```

I'm going to increase my offer to Bob a little, but still keep the majority of the money for myself.  I need to be careful with the inflation, but I'm hoping this offer will be good enough to get him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low for me. The inflation is starting to hurt, but I'm still better off waiting until the next round and making a new offer. I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 729000, ""bob_gain"": 271000}
```

I'm going to increase my offer to Bob again, but I'm still keeping the majority of the money for myself.  I need to be careful with the inflation, but I'm hoping this offer will be good enough to get him to accept. I'm starting to feel the pressure, though, as the inflation is getting higher and I don't want to end up with too little."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low for me, even with the inflation.  I'm going to wait until next round and make a new offer. The inflation is definitely starting to hurt, but I'm still confident I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 656100, ""bob_gain"": 343900}
```

I'm going to increase my offer to Bob again, but I'm still keeping the majority of the money for myself.  The inflation is really starting to hurt now, but I'm hoping this offer will be good enough to get him to accept. If he rejects it, I'm not sure how much longer I can keep going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

The inflation is starting to really eat away at my potential gains.  This is a much better offer than Bob's last one.  I'm accepting it, even though it's a bit less than I hoped for. I've learned a valuable lesson about the importance of considering inflation in negotiations."
