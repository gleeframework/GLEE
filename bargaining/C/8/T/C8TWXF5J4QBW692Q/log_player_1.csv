"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I think this is a good starting point""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle and try again! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not convinced that meeting in the middle is the best approach. I was hoping to get a better deal than 50-50. I think I can do better than that. Let's try again!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. This is my revised offer""}

I'm trying to get a better deal by proposing a 70-30 split. I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more than the 50-50 split that Bob proposed earlier."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you more, but I think 75 is a bit too much. Let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I was hoping to get a better deal, but 75-25 is a pretty good split. I think I can live with this. Plus, I don't want to risk going to the next round and potentially getting a worse deal due to further inflation. Let's take this offer and split the money!"
