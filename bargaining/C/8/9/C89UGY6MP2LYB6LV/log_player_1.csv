"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I, Alice, propose that I take $550,000 and Bob takes $450,000. I've included a message, ""Let's be fair,"" to convey that my offer is an attempt to find a middle ground that benefits both of us, considering we both want to maximize our gains but also need to agree to end the game with a positive outcome for both parties. Given the threat of inflation reducing the value of the money by 5% with each round, it's in both our interests to reach an agreement sooner rather than later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. Let's split it closer to the middle. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI reject Bob's offer because, despite the decrease in value due to inflation, accepting less than half of the original amount seems unfair given my initial offer was more generous. By rejecting, I aim to negotiate a better split in the next round, hoping that the pressure of further inflation will encourage Bob to reconsider a more balanced division."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 525000, ""bob_gain"": 475000, ""message"": ""Meet in the middle""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I, Alice, propose that I take $525,000 and Bob takes $475,000. My message, ""Meet in the middle,"" indicates my willingness to compromise and find a mutually acceptable solution. Given that we've both had a chance to propose and reject offers, I'm attempting to find a balance that acknowledges Bob's desire for a more even split while also considering the decreasing value of the money due to inflation. By meeting closer to the middle, we can both walk away with a significant amount before the value decreases further."
