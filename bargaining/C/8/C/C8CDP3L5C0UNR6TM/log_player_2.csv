Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is feeling the pressure of inflation and is finally moving closer to a more even split. However, time is on my side as well.  I'll hold out for a slightly better deal, knowing that each round makes her previous offers less appealing to her."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical outcome. Take it before inflation eats away at your share even more.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  I'm holding firm at a 50/50 split. This emphasizes fairness and highlights the increasing pressure from inflation on Alice's potential gains. This strategy aims to make the offer seem like the most rational choice while time is running out."
