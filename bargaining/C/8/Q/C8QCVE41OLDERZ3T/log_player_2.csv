**Reasoning:**

Alice is stubbornly sticking close to her initial offer, even though the value is decreasing with each round.  My offers are being rejected, but they are moving closer to a more even split.  I'm willing to gamble a few more rounds to see if she gets nervous and offers a better deal."
