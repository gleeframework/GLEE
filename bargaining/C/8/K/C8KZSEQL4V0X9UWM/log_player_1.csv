"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'm open to negotiations""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40, which is 40% of the original $100, and keeping $60 for myself. I'm framing this as a fair starting point to see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, let's see if we can do better 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think for a moment... 

Since the money is worth 10% less now, I'd rather not settle for 50% of the remaining value. I'd like to try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 10% less again, my offer needs to take that into account.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $45, which is 45% of the remaining value, and keeping $55 for myself. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer to my target, but I think I can do better 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a bite out of my gains!

Considering Bob's new offer, I'm not thrilled about giving up more of the remaining value. However, I don't want to risk going into further rounds and losing even more value.

I'll think for a moment...

Since the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'd rather not settle for 45% of the remaining value. However, I don't want to risk going into another round either.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth even less now, I need to be strategic.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""I'm not budging much, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $50, which is 50% of the remaining value, and keeping $50 for myself. I'm hoping this will be more acceptable to Bob, considering the value of the money is decreasing rapidly."
