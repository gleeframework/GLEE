"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this split is fair and gives us both a good deal. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to see if I can get a better deal in the next round. Since the money is worth 20% less for me with each passing round, I have to be strategic about when to accept an offer. Let's proceed to the next round and see what happens!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's try to find a middle ground. Since the money is worth less to me with each round, I'm willing to be a bit more aggressive with my offer. I think this split is more reasonable, considering the circumstances.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I need a bit more to make it worthwhile for me.  This offer considers the time pressure and gives us both a decent share. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlthough the money is worth 36% less to me now, I still think I can negotiate a better deal. Alice's offer is slightly better than her initial one, but I'm willing to take the risk and see what happens in the next round. Maybe I can get an even better offer or make a more appealing proposal myself. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""I understand we're both trying to get the best deal, but I'm under more pressure due to inflation. This offer is a bit more aggressive, considering the money's decreasing value to me. I hope you can see the urgency and accept this proposal.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we need to find a solution soon.  I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle, but I still need a reasonable share.  Time is running out for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant decrease in value due to inflation, I think it's wise to accept this offer. The difference between what I gain and what Alice gains is relatively small, and the risk of proceeding to the next round might not be worth the potential loss. By accepting this offer, I ensure that I receive a reasonable amount, despite the decreased value. It's time to finalize the deal!"
