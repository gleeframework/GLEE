"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 
I propose that I get $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000.  I'm trying to be generous while still getting the majority share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 810000, ""bob_gain"": 190000}
``` 

I'm lowering my share a bit, but still aiming for a significant portion.  I'm hoping Bob will see that we're both better off getting something than waiting for the inflation to eat away at our potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 190000 
# Bob gain: 810000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm still holding out for a better deal. Bob's offer is still very unequal, and I'm not sure if he understands how much inflation is hurting me.  I need to push for a fairer split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 729000, ""bob_gain"": 271000}
```

I'm lowering my share again, but I'm still hoping for a more favorable outcome than if we keep rejecting each other's offers.  With the inflation getting worse, we both risk losing a lot of potential gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 271000 
# Bob gain: 729000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While the offer is a little better than the previous one, it's still heavily skewed towards Bob.  The inflation is really starting to bite, but I think we can both do better with a bit more negotiation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 656100, ""bob_gain"": 343900}
```

I'm lowering my share once more. I'm hoping that Bob will realize that we're both losing money with each passing round and that a more equitable split is in both of our best interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 343900 
# Bob gain: 656100 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too lopsided, and the inflation is eating away at the value of the money more and more with each round. I'm still hoping we can reach a fairer agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 590490, ""bob_gain"": 409510}
```

I'm pushing for a more even split, but I'm also aware that time is running out. The inflation is severe now, and we're both losing significant amounts of money with each round. I hope Bob sees the value in reaching a compromise sooner rather than later."
