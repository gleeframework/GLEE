I'm going for a large share, hoping to get a quick resolution!  Let's see what Bob thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a fair deal, and the longer we go on, the more likely it is that inflation will hurt me. I'm willing to split the money evenly."
