"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm feeling generous, Alice. Take it or leave it.""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Value of Money:** Due to inflation, the value of the money decreases for me with each round.  It's better to secure a larger portion sooner rather than later.
* **Strategic Advantage:** By rejecting Alice's offer and proposing a slightly better deal for myself, I'm signaling that I'm willing to play the game and aim for a more advantageous outcome. 
* **Calculated Risk:**  There's a risk that Alice might reject my offer, leading to a lower potential payout in future rounds. However, the potential gain in this round outweighs the risk of a slightly worse outcome later."
