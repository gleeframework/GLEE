"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 40, and I'll get 60.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small amount, but I think I deserve more for my part. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of 20 is worth 95% of the original amount, which is $19 (20 * 0.95).

Bob's gain of 80 is worth 80% of the original amount, which is $80 (80 * 0.8).

Considering the large difference in the split, I'll reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{

  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. You'll get 45, and I'll take 55. It's a fair split.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which is a slight adjustment from my initial offer. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging, take what's left! 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of 10 is worth 85.74% of the original amount, which is approximately $8.57 (10 * 0.8574).

Bob's gain of 90 is worth 52% of the original amount, which is $52.

Considering the extreme difference in the split, I'll reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
