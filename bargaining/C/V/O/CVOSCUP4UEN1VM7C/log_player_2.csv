Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 570000

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate as the rounds progress and the money loses value for her. While her offer is slightly better than her previous one, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  I'm betting I can get a better deal by continuing to hold out."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""This is my final offer, Alice. A straight 50/50 split. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to play hardball.  Offering a 50/50 split is fair and emphasizes the urgency of the situation. Alice's potential gains are rapidly diminishing, so she needs to make a decision now or risk losing a significant amount of money."
