Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final proposal, but I'm still not convinced. I'll give you one more chance to accept a reasonable offer. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While Alice's offer is still not ideal, the inflation is making the money I receive worth significantly less.  It's better to take this offer and end the game rather than risk getting even less in future rounds."
