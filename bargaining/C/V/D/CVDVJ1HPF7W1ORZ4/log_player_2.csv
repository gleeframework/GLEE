**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, Alice's offer is now closer to a 50/50 split. It's important to consider that:

* **Inflation is hurting Alice:**  With each round, the value of her potential gain decreases. She's likely feeling the pressure.
* **My bargaining power is stable:**  Inflation doesn't affect me in this scenario, so I can afford to be a bit more patient.

Waiting longer might force Alice to offer an even better deal, but there's also the risk she becomes too desperate and offers a terrible deal out of spite. Accepting now secures a reasonable amount."
