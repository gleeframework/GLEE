"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing to split the $10,000 equally between us, with each of us getting $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take it or leave it, I'm a generous guy! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, my effective gain would be $4,750 (5000 * 0.95). Similarly, Bob's gain of $6,000 is worth 20% less than his initial gain of $7,500, so his effective gain would be $6,000.

Considering the offer, I'm not thrilled about giving up $1,000 to Bob. However, Bob's message is quite... generous, and I don't want to risk going to the next round and potentially losing even more.

I'll decide to accept this offer.
