"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $300,000 is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, which is $270,000. Bob's gain of $700,000 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, which is $560,000.

I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal, so I'll reject this offer.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In round 3, I'll try to be more aggressive. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm offering to take 70% of the remaining $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values of the gains in this round.

My gain of $450,000 is worth 45.0% of what it was in the first round, which is $450,000 * 0.45 = $202,500.

Bob's gain of $550,000 is worth 55.0% of what it was in the first round, which is $550,000 * 0.55 = $302,500.

Considering the inflation, I think this offer is more reasonable than my previous ones, so I'll accept it.
