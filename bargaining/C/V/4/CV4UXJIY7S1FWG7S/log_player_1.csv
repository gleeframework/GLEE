"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor, as I am the one making the initial offer. This ensures I get a significant portion of the money while still giving Bob a small incentive to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

```

I am still aiming for a significant portion of the money, but I recognize Bob's power now that he made a counter-proposal. By offering a 70/30 split, I hope to strike a balance between securing a good amount for myself and providing a reasonable incentive for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

Since Bob is clearly not willing to accept a 70/30 split, I believe a 50/50 split is the most logical next step.  The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, and it's better to secure half the remaining amount than to risk getting even less in the following rounds."
