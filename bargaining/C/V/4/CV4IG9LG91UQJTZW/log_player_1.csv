This is my first offer, I'm taking the lion's share since the money is worth less to Bob each round.  Let's see how he reacts!"

I'm still going to try to take a larger share, but this time I'm offering Bob a bit more. Hopefully he sees that it's better to take something than risk getting nothing at all as the rounds continue."

I'm getting increasingly concerned about the inflation, but I still believe I can get a fair share.  I'm offering Bob a slightly larger portion this time, hoping he realizes we're both losing more with each passing round."
