Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm losing value fast, but I still want a bigger share. Meet me in the middle.

# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's losses are increasing, I'm not getting any less money in absolute terms. His offer is getting closer to a more reasonable split, but I'm still aiming for a larger share due to the advantageous situation inflation puts me in.  I'll hold out a bit longer to see if I can pressure him further."
