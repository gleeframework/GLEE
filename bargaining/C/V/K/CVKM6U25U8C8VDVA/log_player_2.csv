Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting desperate and overestimating the impact of inflation on her end. While she loses value, it's not in her best interest to accept such a low amount. I need to push for a better deal while it's still advantageous for me."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 520000,
""alice_gain"": 480000,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm offering you 480,000.  This is a very good deal considering the inflation is only hurting you, not me.  Let's close this out.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're past the halfway point, and Alice needs to realize time is running out. By offering her slightly less than what I offered in round 4, I'm applying pressure while still keeping my potential gain high. The inflation factor is becoming significant, and she needs to recognize that a deal now is better than no deal later."
