"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split, which seems fair to me. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not thrilled about giving up $50,000, especially considering the inflation factor. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a new proposal for Round 3. Considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer, I'll try to negotiate a better deal for myself.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000
}
```

This time, I'm offering a slightly more favorable split, hoping Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 470000 
# Bob gain: 530000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider this new offer from Bob.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

It seems like Bob is willing to meet me halfway, and I'm not sure if I can do better. I'll accept this offer and end the game."
