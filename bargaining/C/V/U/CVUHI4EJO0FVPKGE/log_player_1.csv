"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm starting with a slightly unfair offer, hoping Bob will be willing to accept it quickly to avoid the risk of inflation."

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it seems tempting to take the $1000 now, I want to see if I can negotiate a better deal. There are still 10 rounds left, and the inflation might work in my favor."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8500, ""bob_gain"": 1500}

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
