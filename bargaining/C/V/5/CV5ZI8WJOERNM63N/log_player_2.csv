"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you 40, and I'll take 60. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While a 40/60 split isn't terrible, I'm going to try to get a better deal.  There's a chance I can get more, and I want to see what Alice is willing to offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think we should flip that last offer, Alice. 60 for me, 40 for you.  Seems fair to me!""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit. How about 55 for me and 45 for you? It's a slight improvement for me, but I'm still willing to give you a good deal. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
While I'd still prefer my 60/40 split, the inflation is starting to hit hard. Accepting this offer is the best way to ensure I get something, and it's not too far off from what I originally aimed for."
