"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! Take it or leave it?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take a smaller share, but a better chance to negotiate 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $300,000 is worth 95% of $900,000, which is $855,000. Bob's gain of $700,000 is worth 80% of $100,000, which is $80,000.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. I'm giving up $45,000 ($900,000 - $855,000) to get a slightly better chance to negotiate, but it's not a big difference.

I'll reject the offer for now.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. I'm giving up $450,000 ($900,000 - $450,450) to get a slightly better chance to negotiate, but it's not a huge difference.

However, considering the inflation and the fact that Bob's offer is still a bit more favorable to him, I'll accept this offer.
