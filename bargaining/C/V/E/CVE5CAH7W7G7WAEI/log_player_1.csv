I propose a 60/40 split in my favor, as I am taking a bigger hit from inflation.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I reject Bob's offer.  Even though it's a 40/60 split in my favor, the inflation hit is making the money worth less. I'll take my chances on making a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This time, I'm offering a 50/50 split. While I'm still taking a bigger hit from inflation,  I think this is a fair offer, and hopefully Bob will see it that way."
