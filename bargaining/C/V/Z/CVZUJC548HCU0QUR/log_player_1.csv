"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. This should be a good starting point, as we have 12 rounds to negotiate, and my offer allows for a good deal of potential room for compromise in the future."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I reject this offer. While Bob has increased his share, the inflation has significantly reduced the value of my potential gain. This offer is not a good starting point for continued negotiation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I propose a 70/30 split in my favor. I am willing to compromise from my initial offer, but I still need to maintain a significant portion of the pie to account for the continued inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While inflation has significantly impacted the value of the money, a 50/50 split is a fair outcome given the remaining rounds.  I'm willing to accept this to avoid the risk of getting nothing at all."
