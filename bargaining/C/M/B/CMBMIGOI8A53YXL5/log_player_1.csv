"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I propose we split the $10,000 with a 60/40 split in favor of Alice. This ensures a fair distribution considering the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 50/50 split, as the diminishing value of money makes it more important to share it evenly. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
