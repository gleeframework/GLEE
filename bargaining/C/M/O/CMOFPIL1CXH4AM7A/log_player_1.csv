"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60-40 split, with me receiving $400,000 and you receiving $600,000. This is a fair compromise considering the initial offer was 70-30 in your favor. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
