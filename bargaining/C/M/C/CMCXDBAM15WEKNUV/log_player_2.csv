"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60/40. Fair deal, I think!

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, but my offer ensures we both benefit despite the inflation. Let's be practical.""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Impact:**  It's crucial to consider the decreasing value of the money. Accepting Alice's offer in Round 3 or later would significantly reduce Bob's potential gain.
* **Fairness with a Twist:** While Alice's 60/40 split seems unfair, Bob's counter-offer is still tilted in his favor, but with a smaller margin to appear more reasonable.
* **Urgency:** The message emphasizes the need for a quick resolution due to the inflation factor, subtly pressuring Alice to accept."
