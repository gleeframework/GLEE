"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, a fair start! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less in the second round, I'll consider the actual amount I'd gain as 9000 * 0.9 = 8100.

I'll reject Bob's offer since I can do better than a 50/50 split.

Round 3
