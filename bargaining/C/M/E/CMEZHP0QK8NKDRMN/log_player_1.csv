"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, I'm the only one who knows what's good for you!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get all the money, and Bob gets nothing. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Fair share, let's split it down the middle 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","A fair offer from Bob!

I accept his proposal. I'll take 50$ and Bob will take 50$. It's a fair split, and I'm not greedy.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
