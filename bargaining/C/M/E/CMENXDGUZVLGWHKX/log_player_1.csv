"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

This offer gives me a significant portion of the money, but leaves some for Bob to potentially accept.  It's a good starting point, and hopefully, Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my initial offer.  While it's tempting to accept since I'm losing value each round, I think I can still do better if I push for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7500, ""bob_gain"": 2500}
```

I'm still aiming for a larger share but offering a bit more to Bob this time.  I'm hoping this will convince him to accept, as the money is losing value with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to what I want, it's still not a good split for me.  The inflation is really hurting my gains, but I'm still holding out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500}
```

I'm adjusting my offer again, trying to find a middle ground. With the inflation hitting us both harder now, I'm hoping Bob will see the value in accepting a slightly more balanced split."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to being what I'd like, it's still not fair given the inflation.  I'm losing a lot of money each round, but I believe there's still time to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

I'm making a significant concession this round, recognizing the increasing pressure from inflation. This offer still gives me a majority share, but it's closer to a 50/50 split, which I hope will entice Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting increasingly unfavorable for me, the loss of value due to inflation makes it really hard to swallow. However, I still think there's a chance I can secure a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500}
```

I'm getting desperate now. Inflation is eating away at my potential earnings, and I'm losing ground with each round.  This offer is a significant concession, but I'm hoping that with the remaining time, Bob will see the value in agreeing to a more balanced split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 86.58% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 36.98% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1500 
# Bob gain: 8500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a very difficult choice, but I'm still clinging to hope. Even though the inflation is making my potential gains incredibly small, I refuse to settle for such a lopsided deal.  I need to try one more time to convince Bob to agree to something fairer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 3500, ""bob_gain"": 6500}
```

This is my final attempt to reach a compromise. I'm taking a big risk, and the potential gains are incredibly small due to inflation. However, I believe this is the closest we can get to a fair split given the circumstances. I hope Bob recognizes the pressure we're both under and agrees to this final offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 91.41% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 43.12% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, the inflation has taken a huge toll on my potential earnings. Even though Bob's offer is highly unfavorable, I'm left with no other choice.  It's better to accept something than nothing at all, and even this small amount will be worth something after inflation."
