Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's stop wasting time. I'm offering a 50/50 split to end this fairly before inflation eats away at the value any further. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000
