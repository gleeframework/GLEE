"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and avoid drawn-out negotiations. I take a slight majority to account for the diminishing value over time. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
This is a good starting point.  I'm going to try to get a better deal for myself. Let's see what Alice proposes next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, but I think it's time we both got a bit more. This offer is more in line with the dwindling value of the money, but still leaves us both with a decent share.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your offer is tempting, but the time pressure is on me more than you. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers to find a compromise. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is good considering the time pressure.  I'll take it!"
