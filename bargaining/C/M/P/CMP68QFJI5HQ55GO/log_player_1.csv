I'm going to start with a pretty aggressive offer, aiming for a large share of the money. I'll see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is starting to take effect and I don't want to risk getting nothing. A 50/50 split is fair, and I'm willing to take it."
