"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  This is a good starting point that leaves room for negotiation, while still being a significant offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I propose a 80/20 split in my favor.  Despite the inflation, I'm still willing to offer a significant share to Bob.  This demonstrates my flexibility and encourages a potential agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is getting increasingly unfair.  While I'm not sure about the exact inflation numbers, my share is shrinking rapidly while his is staying high. I need to keep fighting for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a compromise acknowledging the inflation but still maintaining a considerable share. I hope Bob will accept this, as it is a more equitable split than his last offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is absurdly low.  Even with the inflation, this is completely unacceptable.  I'm willing to negotiate but not at the expense of being practically given nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000}
```

I propose a 40/60 split in Bob's favor.  This is a significant concession to acknowledge the impact of inflation and hopefully encourage him to accept a deal. I'm hoping this demonstrates my willingness to compromise and avoid a stalemate."
