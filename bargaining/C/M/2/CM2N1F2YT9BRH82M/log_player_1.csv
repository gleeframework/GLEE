"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need for negotiations""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, as it's a fair and straightforward way to divide the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to be careful with my decision.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that I'm getting a good deal, and I'd like to try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and the previous offers, I'll make a new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly higher amount to Bob, but still trying to maintain a balance between the two of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think this is a fairer split 
# Alice gain: 3800 
# Bob gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation continuing to erode the value of the money, I need to be cautious. Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that this is a good deal for me, and I'd like to try to negotiate further to get a better outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation continuing to affect the value of the money, I'll make a new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need a bit more""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and not giving up too much to Bob."
