"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is a fair starting point. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable outcome. 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. It's not very fair, and I think we can do better.  Let's see what I can offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think this is a fair and balanced proposal. It gives us both a good amount of the money, and hopefully we can reach an agreement here.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money evenly. It's the fairest outcome, and we both get a decent amount. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
While I'd prefer a slightly larger share, splitting the money evenly is a fair and reasonable outcome, especially with inflation affecting Alice's gains more than mine."
