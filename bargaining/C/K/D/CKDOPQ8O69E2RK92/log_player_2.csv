"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While Alice's offer seems ""fair"" on the surface, I'm going to reject it.  The inflation rate means I lose a lot more value than Alice if we wait.  I'm going to see if I can get a better deal by proposing in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I'm willing to be generous, but the inflation is hitting me harder. Let's split it 60/40, and we can both walk away with a good deal.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle considering the inflation, 50/50 of what's left 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer more, considering the inflation rate,  a 50/50 split is a fair compromise.  It's better than the risk of getting a worse offer in the next round."
