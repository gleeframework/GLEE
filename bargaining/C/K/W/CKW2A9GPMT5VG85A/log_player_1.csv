"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good start""}\n\n### I'll start by offering a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a fairly standard opening offer in negotiation games like this. The message is a gentle nudge to encourage Bob to accept, framing the offer as a fair starting point. Of course, the goal is to maximize my gain while still being reasonable enough for Bob to consider accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 65-35 is a fair split, considering the inflation we'll both face in the next rounds.  What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n### I'll reject Bob's offer for now. Although the inflation does reduce the value of my potential gain, accepting 35 at this stage seems too early, especially since we have multiple rounds left and I started with a higher demand. Rejecting allows me to counteroffer and potentially find a more favorable split in the next rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I'm willing to compromise. 58-42 is a more reasonable split.""}\n\n### I'll adjust my initial offer to show willingness to compromise, considering the pressure of inflation. By slightly reducing my demand, I aim to appear more reasonable while still aiming for a favorable split. The message emphasizes my consideration of the inflation factor to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness."
