Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my friend, this back and forth is costing us both. I'll be generous - $65 for me, $35 for you.  Let's end this before inflation eats up even more of our potential gains! 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65
