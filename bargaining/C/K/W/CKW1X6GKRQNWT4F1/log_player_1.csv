Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that. I'm offering you $45, which is still a good deal considering the inflation. Let's settle this before we lose even more money! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55
