Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a more balanced division. Each of us gets $500000, reflecting the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds. 
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
