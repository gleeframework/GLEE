Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm proposing a very uneven split, giving myself almost all the money. I'm taking advantage of the fact that your money is worth more than Bob's in the early rounds. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a fair split, and while I could potentially get more in later rounds, it's not worth the risk. There's no guarantee Bob will be willing to offer me more in the future."
