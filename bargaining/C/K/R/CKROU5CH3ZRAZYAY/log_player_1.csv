"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the $10,000 and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but the money Bob gains is worth 20% less, I need to consider the relative value of the money I gain compared to the money Bob gains.

In this round, I get 5000 dollars, which is worth the same as 8000 dollars in the first round. However, Bob gets 5000 dollars, which is worth 20% less than 2000 dollars in the first round, so it's equivalent to 1600 dollars in the first round.

Considering this, I think I'm getting a better deal in this round, so I'll accept Bob's offer.
