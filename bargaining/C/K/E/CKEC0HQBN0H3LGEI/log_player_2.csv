**Reasoning:**

Alice's offers are getting worse for her due to inflation, but they are still not in my favor.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can secure a better deal."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Let's be practical. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both benefit. This offer won't get any better for you.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly aiming for a larger share but doesn't seem to grasp the urgency of the situation.  I'm offering a 50/50 split now because it's fair and sends a clear message. With time running out, it's less likely she'll secure a better deal later."
