Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a split that gives me the majority of the money.  I figure Bob will be tempted to take it, but I'm willing to risk a few rounds if he's not.  I'm curious to see how inflation will affect him!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more money, the inflation is starting to hurt and I'm not sure Bob will offer me anything better in the next round. It's better to take what I can get now."
