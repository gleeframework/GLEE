"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 400k, and I'll take 600k. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable for the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split in my favor is fair, considering I'm taking the risk of rejection. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see that Bob is trying to get a better deal, but I'm not convinced. Considering the inflation, I'll make a counteroffer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Your offer is too generous to you, considering the inflation. I'll make a counteroffer: 55/45 in my favor.""
}
```

I'm trying to get a slightly better deal for myself, considering the decreasing value of the money due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation taking its toll, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money. Since the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, I'll aim for a slightly larger share:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'll give you a slightly smaller share. 55/45 seems fair to me. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm trying to adjust my offer to reflect the decreasing value of the money, while still keeping a decent share for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still holding firm on my previous offer. We both need to be reasonable here, and a 60/40 split seems like the fairest outcome given the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is sticking to his original offer, but I'm not willing to accept it. The inflation has taken a significant toll on the money's value, and I think I can do better. Considering the decreasing value of the money, I'll make a counteroffer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to accept a 60/40 split, especially considering the inflation. I'll make a counteroffer: 58/42 in my favor.""
}
```

I'm trying to get a slightly better deal for myself, taking into account the reduced value of the money due to inflation."

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'll give you a smaller share. 52/48 seems like a fair compromise. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share for myself and being reasonable, considering the decreasing value of the money."
