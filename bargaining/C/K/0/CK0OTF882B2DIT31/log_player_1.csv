"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

This is my initial offer. I believe it's fair, giving me a larger share as I am the one making the offer.  I'm hoping Bob will accept it to avoid the risk of inflation affecting the value of the money in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation risk is significant. Accepting this offer guarantees me at least 5,000, even with the 20% loss due to inflation. It's a much better outcome than risking getting nothing at all in the later rounds."
