"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 20% and take the rest.""
}
```

This way, I'm giving Bob a relatively small portion, but it's a fair starting point, and I'm keeping the majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not giving away too much yet. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll aim to get a larger share this round. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect, I'll aim to get an even larger share this round. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm still willing to compromise.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet in the middle, let's split it 50/50 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the money is worth significantly less, and I'm getting a smaller share each round. Since Bob is now offering a 50/50 split, I think this is a reasonable compromise. I'll accept this offer.
