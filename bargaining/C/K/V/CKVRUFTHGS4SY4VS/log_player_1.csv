"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game quickly.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small portion of the total, in the hopes that he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Fair is fair. I'll take most of the money this round, but you'll get to make the next offer. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take a big chunk of the money this round.

I'll reject his offer and wait for the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth 20% less than in round 2, so I'll have to be careful with my offer.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""You took a big chunk last round, now it's my turn to take a bit more. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $580,000, which is a bit more than I offered in the first round, but still leaving room for negotiation."
