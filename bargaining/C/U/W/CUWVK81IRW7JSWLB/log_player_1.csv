"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

**Explanation:**

I propose a 90/10 split in favor of Alice. This is a relatively generous offer considering the potential for inflation. While I want to maximize my own gains, I'm also trying to secure a deal in the first round to avoid the risk of losing money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Explanation:**

While a 50/50 split isn't ideal, it's better than the risk of further inflation.  My gains are now worth 20% less, so accepting a 50% share is a reasonable outcome considering the circumstances."
