"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a small share, but I think I deserve more considering the current inflation rate. This way, I'll have a bigger share to make up for the loss in value. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
