"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm proposing to take 90% of the money, leaving Bob with 10%.  It's a bit of a power move, but I figure he'll likely accept rather than risk getting nothing in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer to get more, it's better to take the 10% now.  If I reject, the money will be worth even less in the next round, and I might end up with nothing."
