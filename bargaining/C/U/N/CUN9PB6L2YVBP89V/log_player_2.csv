"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my share is worth less now. I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bigger share. Let's do 58-42 and call it a day. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is right that her share is worth less due to the higher inflation rate she faces, she's still getting the lion's share.  It's better for me to push for a more equitable split, even if it means going another round and facing a slightly smaller pot."

Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 520000, ""alice_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. Your offers have been unreasonable from the start. I'm offering a 52/48 split, which is more than fair considering the shrinking pot. Take it before inflation eats away at your potential gains even further.""}
