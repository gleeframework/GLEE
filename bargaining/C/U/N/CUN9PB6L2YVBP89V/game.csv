600000.0,400000.0,Let's be fair and split it 60-40. I think this is a generous offer considering I'm the one making the first move.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Your split seems heavily skewed in your favor, especially considering the inflation. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. Take it or watch your share dwindle.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
580000.0,420000.0,"Considering the inflation, my share is worth less now. I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bigger share. Let's do 58-42 and call it a day.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
480000.0,520000.0,"Alice, this is getting ridiculous. Your offers have been unreasonable from the start. I'm offering a 52/48 split, which is more than fair considering the shrinking pot. Take it before inflation eats away at your potential gains even further.",Bob,4,
