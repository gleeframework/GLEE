"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```
I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $100, leaving Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this new offer. Since the money is worth 20% less, I'll have to adjust my strategy accordingly.

I'll accept this offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```
This way, I'll get 40% of the reduced amount, which is better than risking going into further rounds and dealing with even more inflation."
