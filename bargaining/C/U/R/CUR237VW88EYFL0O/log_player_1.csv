"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  This seems like a fair starting point, as I'm taking a slight majority, but leaving Bob with a decent amount as well. Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

A 50/50 split is a fair offer, especially considering the inflation that Bob is facing. It's better to take a guaranteed 50% than risk losing it all by continuing the game."
