"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
 
I propose to take 9000 dollars and leave 1000 dollars for Bob. This is a fair initial offer, as it leaves Bob with some money while securing the majority for me.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer.  While it seems generous on the surface, it's important to consider the inflation factor.  Since the value of Bob's offer has decreased by 20%, it's no longer a fair deal for me. I'm willing to negotiate further to ensure a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm lowering my requested amount to 8000, but still offering Bob a significant share of 2000.  This is a fair compromise considering the inflation factor and should hopefully lead to a mutually acceptable agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. While it seems generous, I cannot accept a deal where I get only 2000 dollars. The inflation factor on Bob's end has significantly reduced the value of his offer, and I need to ensure a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm making another concession by lowering my share to 7000, while offering Bob 3000.  This is a fair compromise considering the inflation impacting the value of his gains.  Hopefully, this will encourage Bob to accept and end the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. While his share has decreased significantly due to inflation, I cannot accept a deal where I get only 3000 dollars. I need to ensure a more equitable split and am willing to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I am lowering my requested amount to 6000 dollars, but still offering Bob a decent share of 4000 dollars.  This is a significant compromise considering the increasing inflation factor, and I believe it is a fair and reasonable proposal for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. Despite the significant inflation affecting the value of his share, I cannot accept a deal where I receive only 4000 dollars. I am still willing to negotiate, but I need to ensure a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

With the inflation significantly impacting the value of Bob's offers, and the dwindling number of rounds remaining, I propose a 50/50 split. This is the most fair solution given the circumstances and ensures both of us receive a significant share of the remaining money."
