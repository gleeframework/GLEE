"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the initial $10,000, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, so I need to consider that when making my decision.

I will reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, my gain is now worth 64% of what it was in the first round (80% * 80%). I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3840,
  ""bob_gain"": 6160
}
```

This way, I get 38.4% of the initial $10,000, and Bob gets 61.6%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3800 
# Bob gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 51.2% of what it was in the first round (100% - 48.8%). I'll consider Bob's new offer.

Since my gain is now worth 51.2% of the original amount, and Bob's offer is 38% of the original amount, I'll accept Bob's offer from Round 4.
