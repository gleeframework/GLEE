Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle, 58-42 is the new fair! 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5100,
""alice_gain"": 4900,
""message"": ""The value is decreasing Alice, let's be practical. 51/49?""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on Bob, 56-44 and we're done! 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, Alice's offers are getting close to a 50/50 split due to her perceived losses from inflation.  While I'd prefer to hold out for a better deal, it's getting risky. If Alice's offers continue this trend, I might end up with even less in the next round.
