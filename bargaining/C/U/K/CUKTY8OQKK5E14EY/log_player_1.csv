Let's see if Bob is feeling generous!  I'm starting with a high offer for myself, hoping to get the game over quickly before inflation kicks in."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting this offer. Even though Bob's offer is a significant improvement from the first round, I'm still in a strong position. I believe I can get a better deal in the future rounds, as I'm not affected by inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly, hoping to incentivize Bob to accept. I'm still aiming for a large share, but I'm willing to compromise a bit.  Since inflation is only impacting Bob, I'm trying to take advantage of that by increasing my gain slowly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting this offer.  Bob's offer is getting progressively worse for me due to inflation, but I'm still confident I can get a better deal later on. I'm in a strong position because I'm not affected by inflation, so I can wait it out."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm sticking with my previous offer. While Bob's offer is getting worse due to inflation, I'm not seeing any signs that he's desperate yet. I'll keep offering a slightly higher share for myself and see if he eventually caves."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse, but I'm still holding out for a better deal. Inflation is severely impacting him, and I know he'll eventually have to give in to get something."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm sticking with my previous offer. Inflation is hitting Bob hard, and I'm confident he'll eventually accept to get something rather than nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is finally getting close to a 50/50 split, and with inflation continuing to eat away at his potential gains, I'm willing to accept this deal.  I'm still getting a good share of the money, and it's better to take what I can get than risk getting nothing."
