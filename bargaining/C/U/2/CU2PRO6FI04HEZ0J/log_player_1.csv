Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your generosity, Alice, but I think a 95/5 split is a little too one-sided.  How about we go with 90/10? It's still a good deal for you, and fairer for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95
