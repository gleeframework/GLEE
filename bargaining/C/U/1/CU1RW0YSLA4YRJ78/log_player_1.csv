Let's see if Bob is happy with a 90/10 split.  I'm feeling generous this round! ðŸ˜‰"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's better to take the 50/50 split now than risk getting nothing in the next rounds.  Inflation is a real threat!"
