"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I think 60/40 is a good place to begin. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

While a 60/40 split is a good starting point, I want to see if I can get a better deal.  I'll make a counter-offer next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split, with me getting the larger share, is a more fair reflection of my value.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit. Let's try 55/45.  This way, we both get a decent share, and we can avoid further losses from inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

While I appreciate Alice's willingness to compromise, I still think a 60/40 split is more fair, especially considering the inflation rate. I'll try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm sticking with my previous offer.  With each round, the value of the money decreases, so it's in both our best interests to reach an agreement quickly.  Let's split the money 60/40 and move on.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The inflation is getting serious.  Let's just split the money evenly.  50/50 is the fairest way to avoid losing more. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

With the inflation rate increasing, I think it's best to take the 50/50 split and avoid further losses.  While I'd prefer a larger share, the risk of getting nothing is too great."
