"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise.  Let's split it 85/15. It's still a better deal for me with the inflation, and gives us both more than the last offer. 
# Bob gain: 150000 
# Alice gain: 850000
