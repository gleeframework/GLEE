"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share this time, but we can work out a better deal later. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Let's see how the game progresses. While not ideal, I'm willing to forgo the initial offer to aim for a more balanced outcome in the later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""My turn! This offer recognizes the time pressure and inflation. Let's secure a good deal now.""
}
``` 

Let me know Alice's decision!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the difference. I'll take a smaller share to avoid the risk of getting nothing at all. 
# Bob gain: 600000 
# Alice gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice's offer is now reasonable considering the inflation and the remaining rounds. Accepting secures a decent amount rather than risking a worse outcome later."
