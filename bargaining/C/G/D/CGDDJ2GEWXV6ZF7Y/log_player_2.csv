Let's see if I can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}

I'm going for a 60/40 split in my favor.  This is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Alice will see the value in getting something rather than risking getting nothing if we keep going."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is still not great.  Even though it's slightly better than her first offer, it's still not a fair split.  I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly to 5500 for me and 4500 for Alice. I'm hoping that this offer is more appealing to her, considering the increasing risk of getting nothing as the rounds progress."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

# Alice gain: 5070 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting Alice's offer.  The inflation is starting to bite, and I don't want to risk getting nothing.  It's not a great split, but it's better than nothing."
