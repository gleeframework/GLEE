6000.0,4000.0,Let's start fair. I'll take 60% and you get 40%. What do you say?,Alice,1,

4500.0,5500.0,"I'm willing to give you a bit more than you offered, but I think it's fair that I get a larger share since the money depreciates more quickly for me.",Bob,2,

5500.0,4500.0,"I appreciate the offer, Bob, but I'm not sure I'm comfortable with that split. How about we meet in the middle and both take 50% this round? It's still a loss for both of us due to inflation, but at least it's a fair loss.",Alice,3,
