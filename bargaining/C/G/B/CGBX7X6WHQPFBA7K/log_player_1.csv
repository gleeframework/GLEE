"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This offer gives me a significant advantage, but it's still a reasonable starting point. It leaves Bob with something and might encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

This is a clear power shift in Bob's favor. I reject this offer and will propose a more equitable division in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8100, ""bob_gain"": 1900}
```

I'm reducing my share by a smaller amount than Bob did in the previous round, reflecting the inflation disadvantage I'm facing. This is still a good deal for me, and it shows a willingness to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting more and more lopsided in his favor. I'm still willing to negotiate, but I won't accept such a disproportionate division."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7290, ""bob_gain"": 2710}
```

I'm further reducing my share, but still leaving Bob with a significant portion. I'm hoping this demonstrates flexibility and encourages Bob to accept before the inflation eats away at both of our gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is becoming increasingly unfair, even with the inflation disadvantage. I will continue to negotiate for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6561, ""bob_gain"": 3439}
```

I'm continuing to decrease my share, but it's getting increasingly difficult to justify further reductions. This is a significant compromise, and I'm hoping it's enough to entice Bob to accept.  We're running out of time, and the inflation is starting to seriously impact our potential gains."
