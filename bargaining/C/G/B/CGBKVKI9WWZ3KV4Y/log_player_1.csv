"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can propose a better offer if you don't like this one.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is 20% of the initial $10,000. I'm keeping $8,000 for myself, which is 80% of the initial amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly. We can both benefit more if we keep the money flowing. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less after the first round, the new total is $9,500.

I'm not thrilled about giving up $2,000 in value from the previous round, but I think Bob's offer is a good one. I'll accept it.
