"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can negotiate from here!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial $100, which is $20, and I'll take the remaining 80%. This is a relatively generous offer, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it to get some money right away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet you in the middle, let's see if we can do better 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 20% less than the initial offer, so I'll have to adjust my expectations.

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a reasonable proposal, and meeting in the middle is a fair approach. I'll accept the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
