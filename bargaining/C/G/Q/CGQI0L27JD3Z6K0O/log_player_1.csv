"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. I'm taking a large portion to account for the inflation risk, but I'm also leaving a decent amount for Bob to incentivize him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, a 50/50 split is a fair outcome considering the inflation. Accepting ensures I get something and avoids the risk of getting nothing in future rounds."
