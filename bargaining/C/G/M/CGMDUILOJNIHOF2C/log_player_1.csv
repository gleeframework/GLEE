"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the original $10,000, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. But I don't want to risk going to the next round and losing more value due to inflation.

I'll accept the offer.
