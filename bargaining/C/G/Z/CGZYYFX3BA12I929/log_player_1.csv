"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can avoid a long and potentially contentious negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $5000 is now worth $4750, which is less than my initial offer of $6000. Bob's gain of $5000 is now worth $4000, which is a significant decrease.

I'll accept this offer to get something rather than risking further losses due to inflation.
