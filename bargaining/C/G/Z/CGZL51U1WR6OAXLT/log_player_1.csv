I'm going to propose a split of $9,000 for me and $1,000 for Bob.  I'm hoping he'll accept it since it's a decent amount for him, and it gives me a good starting point.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the most logical choice.  After the inflation, my share would be significantly lower if we go another round. It's better to secure a decent amount now than risk getting nothing at all in the end."
