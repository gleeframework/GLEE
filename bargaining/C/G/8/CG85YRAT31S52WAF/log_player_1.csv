"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself, with the message of starting with a fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take this! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less in the second round, I'll calculate my gain accordingly.

My gain would be 20% of 8000 (my gain from Round 1) which is 1600, so my total gain would be 8000 - 1600 = 6400. 

Now, comparing Bob's offer of 4000 to my calculated gain of 6400, I'd rather reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less in the third round, I'll calculate my gain accordingly. My gain would be 20% of 6400 (my gain from Round 2) which is 1280, so my total gain would be 6400 - 1280 = 5120.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share this time, but it's still a good deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself, with the message of giving him a slightly smaller share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: It's time to get serious, meet me in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 48.8% less in the fourth round, I'll calculate my gain accordingly. My gain would be 48.8% of 8000 (my gain from Round 1) which is 3920, so my total gain would be 8000 - 3920 = 4080.

Now, comparing Bob's offer of 5000 to my calculated gain of 4080, I'd rather accept this offer.
