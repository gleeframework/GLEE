Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I'll compromise. This time, I'm taking a smaller share, but I'm still giving you something. Let's finish this!

# Alice gain: 8000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting impatient. Let's just split it 75/25,  I'm not going to budge much more.  Time is money, and this is getting ridiculous. 
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the pressure is on, accepting this offer would mean Bob loses a significant amount of value due to inflation. Alice is clearly taking advantage of the situation. Bob needs to hold out for a better deal, even if it means taking a risk in later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000, ""message"": ""Time is money for both of us, Alice. This is my final offer. Take it or leave it.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  We're past the halfway point, and the inflation is severely hurting Bob's potential gains. A decision needs to be made quickly.
* **Firm Stance:** By presenting this as a ""final offer,"" Bob signals to Alice that he's serious and won't be swayed by further lowball offers. 
* **Balance:** This offer still gives Alice a larger share, but not an egregiously unfair one. It leaves some room for Alice to feel like she's ""won"" something, which might be important to secure a deal."
