"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a small amount to get the game started, but I'm keeping the majority of the money for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  It's a fair deal, and we can both walk away happy. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $9000 in the first round is now worth $8550 in the second round.

Considering Bob's proposal, I think it's a reasonable offer, and splitting it evenly is a fair deal. I'm not getting a great deal, but it's better than going to the next round.
