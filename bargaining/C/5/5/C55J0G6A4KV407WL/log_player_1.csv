"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

I'm starting with a 50/50 split, hoping to set a good precedent for the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, my offer in the first round was equivalent to $5,000, and Bob's offer in this round is equivalent to $4,000 for me, which is less than my initial offer.

I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation effect, my initial offer was worth $5,000, and it's now worth 95% of that, which is $4,750. I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of money.

Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800
}
```

I'm trying to give Bob a slightly smaller share, while still keeping a decent amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the equivalent value of my initial offer in this round. The money I gain is worth 95% of the initial $5,000, and then 86.74% of that, which is $4,337. I'll compare this to Bob's offer.

Considering the equivalent value, Bob's offer is $4,500 for me, which is higher than my calculated equivalent value of $4,337. I'll accept this offer.
