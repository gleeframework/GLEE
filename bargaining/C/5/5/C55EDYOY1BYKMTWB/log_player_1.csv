"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I receive $600,000 and Bob receives $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your turn was 60-40, I'll offer 70-30. Better for me, but still a good deal for you. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too happy about the 70-30 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll think about it...
