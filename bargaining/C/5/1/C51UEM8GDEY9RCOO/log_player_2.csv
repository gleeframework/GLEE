"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less after the first round, it's now worth $8,000.

Here's my offer:
{""bob_gain"": 4000,
""alice_gain"": 6000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts:

Initial $10,000 * 0.8 (20% less) = $8,000 (round 1)
$8,000 * 0.84 (36% less) = $6,720 (round 3)

Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5,000
# Alice gain: 5,000

Since my gain in round 3 is $6,720, and Alice is offering me $5,000, which is less than what I could get, I'll reject her offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 36% less than in the first round, it's now worth $6,400.

Here's my offer:
{""bob_gain"": 4800,
""alice_gain"": 5200}"
