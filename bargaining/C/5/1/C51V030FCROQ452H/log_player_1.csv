"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll start with a generous offer""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000, which is a 80-20 split. I'm being generous, but I'm also hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous, let's take it back a bit 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take a more equal share.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer. I'd like to make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'd like a slightly larger share""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than the previous offer, but still a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share this time 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000

  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'd like to keep some leverage""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which is a bit more favorable to Bob than my previous offer, but still gives me a slight edge."
