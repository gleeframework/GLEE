"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit too low for me. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in your favor.  This accounts for the inflation impact on your end while still giving me a reasonable share. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
