I'm going for a big chunk of the money, but I'm leaving Bob with something to avoid immediate rejection.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is terrible! Even with the inflation, I'm getting a lot less than in the first round. I'm going to reject and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000} 
```

I'm still aiming for a large portion, but I'm reducing my share a bit to account for the inflation. Hopefully, Bob sees this as a better deal than the previous round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

I'm getting significantly less due to inflation, but it's still better than nothing. I need to take what I can get at this point."
