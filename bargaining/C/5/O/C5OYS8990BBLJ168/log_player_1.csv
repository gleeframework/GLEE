"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly less than 50% share, but it's still a decent offer 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer carefully. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll think about the value of the offer in terms of the original $100.

I'll reject the offer for now, hoping to get a better deal. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. I'll make a new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share this time, but I'm not going to give up too much""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share than my previous offer, but I'm still trying to get a better deal for myself."
