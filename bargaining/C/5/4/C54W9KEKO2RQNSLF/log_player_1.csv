Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe a 55/45 split is a more equitable starting point, given the potential for inflation to impact future rounds. Let's work towards a solution that benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{
