"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leave $4,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split in my favor is more fair, considering the potential for inflation! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $4,000 is now worth 95% of its original value, which is $3,800, and Bob's gain of $6,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, which is $5,400.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I think 60-40 is still too skewed towards you, considering the inflation is affecting me more!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain of $3,800 in the previous round is now worth 95% of its original value, which is $3,610, and Bob's gain of $5,400 is now worth 90% of its original value, which is $4,860.

Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering the inflation is affecting us both!""
}
```"
