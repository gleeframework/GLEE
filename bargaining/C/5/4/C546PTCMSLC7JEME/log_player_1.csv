"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 30 dollars, which is a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can wrap things up quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but it's still a decent offer. Think about it! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 40 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, which is a significant decrease. However, I'm not sure if I should accept Bob's offer.

I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to give up 60% of the remaining money just yet. I'll try to do better next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my gain is worth 90.25% of what it was in the first round (95% of 95% = 90.25%). I'll make a new offer, trying to take into account the decreasing value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I'm still not giving up too much.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a risk, but I think I deserve a bigger share. You can't do better than this! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money!

With the new inflation rates, my gain of 20 is worth 85.74% of what it was in the first round (100% - 14.26% = 85.74%). I'm not thrilled about giving up 80% of the remaining money, but I'm not sure if I can do better.

I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to give up that much. I'll try to negotiate further."

  ""message"": ""It's time to split it 50/50. No more negotiations!""
