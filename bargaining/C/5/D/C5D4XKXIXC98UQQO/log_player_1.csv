"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

This is a very aggressive offer, but I believe it is the best way to maximize my share in the first round. Bob will have to consider whether to accept or risk losing even more money in the next round, as his share will decrease significantly with inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is much better than my previous proposal, I am still not satisfied with the division. I am confident that I can negotiate a better deal in the next round, even with the inflation factor."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000} 
```

I'm lowering my demand slightly from the first round, but still aiming for a significant share. Given the inflation, Bob is losing value much faster than I am, making him more likely to accept an offer that seems unfavorable at face value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3600 
# Bob gain: 6400 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While this offer is getting closer to what I would consider acceptable, I'm still not satisfied. Bob's share is still significantly larger than mine, and I believe I can leverage the growing inflation to get a more equitable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split. With the growing inflation, both of us are losing significant value. This offer is fair and will ensure that we both receive a reasonable share before the money becomes worthless."
