"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, it's a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. I think this is a good starting point, and we can adjust as needed in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I'm still being generous! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think Bob is being generous at all! He's trying to take advantage of the situation and get a larger share. I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me only $3,000. I'll reject this offer and hope to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'll compromise and give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not giving up too much!""}

I'm trying to find a middle ground and give Bob a slightly larger share, but still keep a decent amount for myself. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not impressed with Bob's offer again! He's still trying to take advantage of the situation and get a larger share. I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me only $4,000. I think I can do better than that. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate again in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50-50, it's the fairest way!""}

I'm trying to be more aggressive and propose a 50-50 split, which I think is a fair and reasonable offer. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer and we can finally settle on a division!"
