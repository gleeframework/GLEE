"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly, Bob. Accept and we can end this!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, but still willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is already taking a toll!

Considering the new offer, I'll have to think carefully...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I'm not willing to give up 600,000$ (pre-inflation) to Bob. The ratio of 4:1 is too extreme, and I'm hoping for a more balanced split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think this split is fair. Let's end this!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 450,000$ and keeping 550,000$ for myself. I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent amount and not giving up too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm still not giving up too much 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a bite out of my potential earnings!

Considering the new offer, I'll have to think carefully...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I'm not willing to give up 300,000$ (pre-inflation) to Bob. The ratio of 7:3 is still too extreme, and I'm hoping for a more balanced split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
 ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. Let's split the money 50/50.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 500,000$ and keeping 500,000$ for myself. I'm trying to find a fair and balanced split, and a 50/50 ratio seems reasonable."
