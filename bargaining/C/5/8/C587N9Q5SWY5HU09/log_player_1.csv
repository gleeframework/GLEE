I'm going to try one more time to get Bob to accept. I'm willing to give up a bit more, but not too much.  I'm hoping he realizes that inflation is hurting him too, and this might be his best chance."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm getting a bit desperate now. The inflation is really taking a toll. This offer is getting closer to Bob's last offer, but I'm hoping he sees that it's in his best interest to accept, especially considering the inflation rate."
