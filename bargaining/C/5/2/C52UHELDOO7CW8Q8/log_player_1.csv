"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split, which I think is a fair starting point. I'm offering you $2,000, which is 20% of the original $10,000, and I'll take the remaining $8,000 for myself."
