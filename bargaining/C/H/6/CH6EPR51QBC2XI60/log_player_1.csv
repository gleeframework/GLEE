  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $400,000 and keep $600,000 for myself.""

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gain being worth the same and Bob's gain being worth 5% less, I'll have to be careful with my decision.

I'll reject Bob's offer and wait for the next one!"

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share this time, but still keep a decent amount for myself. Consider this a compromise.""
}

Round 4

# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gain being worth the same and Bob's gain being worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I'll have to consider the value of the money more carefully. I'll reject this offer as well.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's previous offer was 550,000, I'll try to counter with an offer that's closer to my original 600,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still think I deserve a slightly larger share. Let's see if you agree.""
