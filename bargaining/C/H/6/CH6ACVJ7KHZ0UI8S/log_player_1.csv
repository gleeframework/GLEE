"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
 
I propose a 9000/1000 split, favoring myself slightly to account for potential inflation.  Let's see what Bob thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is worse than my previous offer, and I know the money is worth less due to inflation. I'll reject and see what he offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8500, ""bob_gain"": 1500}
```

I'm reducing my share slightly to 8500, but I'm still accounting for inflation.  Hopefully, this is a more appealing offer to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

I'm still holding out for a better deal. Even with inflation, Bob's offer is significantly lower than my previous proposals.  I'll reject and see if he's willing to compromise further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm lowering my share again to 8000, hoping to find a compromise.  I'm aware of the inflation, but I need to secure a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is still not good enough. I'm aware of the inflation, but I'm willing to hold out for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7500, ""bob_gain"": 2500}
```

I'm further reducing my share to 7500, hoping Bob will finally accept.  I'm running out of time, but I'm still determined to get a decent share of the money."
