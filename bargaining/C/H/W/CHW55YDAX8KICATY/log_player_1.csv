"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

This is a 50-50 split, a fair and straightforward proposal. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less in this round, the actual values are:

* Alice gain: $4,000 (worth $4,400 in the previous round)
* Bob gain: $6,000 (worth $6,600 in the previous round)

I'll accept Bob's offer.
