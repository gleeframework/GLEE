"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, it's a fair start""
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the original 100$, and Bob gets 40%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60-40 is a fairer split, considering I'm taking the risk of us reaching round 3 where my money is worth less. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to negotiate a better deal for himself, but I'm not going to fall for it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll stick to my original proposal, and we can proceed to the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 0% less for me, but 20% less for Bob, I'll try to take advantage of this to my advantage.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's make it a 50-50 split, but I'll give you a chance to reconsider""
}
```

I'm offering a 50-50 split, which is a fair deal considering the changing value of the money."
