80.0,20.0,I propose we divide the money with an 80/20 split in favor of Alice. This offers a reasonable share for both of us while taking into account the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
40.0,60.0,"I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering the money will be worth less in the next round. This gives us both a decent share, and allows for some flexibility in the future.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,accept
