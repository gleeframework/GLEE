"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""I propose we divide the money with an 80/20 split in favor of Alice. This offers a reasonable share for both of us while taking into account the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering the money will be worth less in the next round. This gives us both a decent share, and allows for some flexibility in the future. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
