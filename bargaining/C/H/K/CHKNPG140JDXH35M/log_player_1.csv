I'm starting with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a quick deal and avoid the potential inflation.  Let's see if he's reasonable!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is much less appealing than my initial proposal, even with inflation. I'll reject this and see if we can reach a more equitable deal in the following rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm reducing my share slightly, but I'm still offering a significant portion to Bob. I believe this is a fair offer, given that I am now bearing the burden of inflation. Hopefully, Bob will see that this is a better option than waiting for further rounds and risk getting nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is becoming increasingly unfavorable, even though it seems more ""fair"" on the surface.  The inflation is drastically reducing my gains, and I'm still willing to take a significant loss to avoid getting nothing at all.  But I can't accept a 50/50 split when I'm losing value with each round.  I'll counter with a better offer for both of us."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering Bob a larger share than his last offer, but I still need a significant amount to make this worthwhile.  With inflation, I can't afford to be too generous anymore. Hopefully, this offer will appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and end this game before the potential for both of us to get nothing becomes a reality."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

While Bob's offer is slightly better than his previous one, the inflation is severely impacting my gains.  I'm still losing a significant portion of the potential money, and I believe I can do better.  I'll continue to try and negotiate a more favorable deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}
```

I'm increasing my offer to Bob, hoping to find a middle ground. I'm still losing a significant amount due to inflation, but I need to secure a deal before the situation worsens even further. This offer is a compromise, and I hope Bob will recognize that it's in our best interest to accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

Although I am losing a significant portion of the money due to inflation, this offer is getting closer to my ideal outcome.  With only 4 rounds left, the risk of getting nothing is becoming increasingly real.  I need to accept this offer to secure at least some gain."
