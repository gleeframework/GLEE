"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a decent amount to keep you interested!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor, giving me the majority of the money, but still leaving Bob with a significant amount to keep him engaged in the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try for a 50/50 split, it's a fair start! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I need to adjust my expectations. A 50/50 split is a more reasonable proposal now, considering the decreased value of the money.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
