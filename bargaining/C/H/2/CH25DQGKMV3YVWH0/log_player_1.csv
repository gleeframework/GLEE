"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle. It's a fair and equal split. No need to risk it all. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I would have preferred a larger share,  a 50/50 split is a good outcome considering the inflation risk. It's better to secure a reasonable amount than risk losing more in the next round."
