"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'm willing to give you a decent amount, but I'm sure we can work out a better deal in the next round if you reject this. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm offering you a sizable portion, but time is money (literally!).  We should settle this now.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your urgency, but I believe this is a more equitable split.  Since we're both losing value with each passing round, let's find a middle ground. Accept this offer and we can both walk away with a significant sum. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
