I'm starting with a pretty aggressive offer, hoping to secure a large portion of the money early on. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer. While I'm getting a smaller cut than in the first round, I'm still confident I can get a better deal if I go to the next round.  The inflation is hurting, but it's not going to make me settle for such a small share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

This offer is a compromise, taking into account the inflation and Bob's previous aggressive offer. I believe it's a fair split and hopefully, Bob will see it that way."
