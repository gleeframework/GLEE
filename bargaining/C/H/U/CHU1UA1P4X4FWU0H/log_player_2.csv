"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split almost evenly, accounting for some minor inflation. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 525000, ""alice_gain"": 475000, ""message"": ""Considering the higher inflation impact on you, I'll take a bit more, but still being somewhat fair.""}\n\n###"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be real. This back and forth is pointless. I'm taking a hit from inflation more than you. A 50/50 split is the only fair outcome at this point. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nSince the money is worth less with each round, and Alice is taking a bigger hit from inflation, I expect a better offer than a 50/50 split. Let's see if I can get a more favorable offer in the next round.\n\n###"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Given the increasing impact of inflation, especially on your end, I believe this split is more reasonable.""}\n\n###"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer. It accounts for the inflation disparity, but I need you to meet me halfway.  If you refuse, we're both losing out. 
# Bob gain: 520000 
# Alice gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on both of us, especially on Alice, this offer seems reasonable. It's better to accept this offer than to risk further losses from inflation in subsequent rounds.\n\n###\n\nThe final answer is: $\boxed{accept}$"
