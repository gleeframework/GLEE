"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still not happy with your offer.  Here's a counter-proposal:  60% for me, 40% for you. Let's come to an agreement. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```
The value of waiting any further is unlikely to result in a better deal for Bob."
