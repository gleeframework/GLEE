"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $70 and Bob gets $30. I'm trying to be generous and start with a fair split, hoping that Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly. It's in both our best interest to come to an agreement quickly! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less in the second round, I need to adjust my thinking accordingly.

In this case, I'll calculate my gain in the second round as 95% of $70 (the original offer), which is $66.50.

Bob's offer is to split the money evenly, which means I would get $50 and Bob would get $50.

Since $50 is less than $66.50, I'll reject Bob's offer and propose a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure splitting it evenly is the best option for me. I'll make a counteroffer.""
}
```

Now it's my turn to make a proposal for Round 3!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less in the third round, my gain will be 95% of $66.50, which is $62.975, or approximately $62.98.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need to prioritize my gain. Can you meet me in the middle?""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40, hoping that Bob will be willing to accept a slightly lower share to move the game forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to ensure I get a fair share as well. Let's try to find a compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 14.26% less in the fourth round, I need to calculate my gain accordingly. To do that, I'll calculate the difference between 100% and 14.26%, which is 85.74%. Then, I'll multiply my original gain in the first round ($70) by 85.74% to get my gain in the fourth round.

$70 x 0.8574 = $60.12

Now, let's compare Bob's offer to my calculated gain. Bob's offer is for me to get $40, which is less than my calculated gain of $60.12.

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with a 60-40 split. I'll try to negotiate for a better deal.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 14.26% less in the fifth round, my gain will be 85.74% of $60.12, which is approximately $51.68.

Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to ensure I get a decent share. Can we meet in the middle again?""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $55 and Bob gets $45, hoping that Bob will be willing to accept a slightly higher share for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to offer you a smaller share, but the time is running out. We need to come to an agreement soon or we'll both lose everything. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 22.62% less in the sixth round, I need to calculate my gain accordingly. To do that, I'll calculate the difference between 100% and 22.62%, which is 77.38%. Then, I'll multiply my original gain in the first round ($70) by 77.38% to get my gain in the sixth round.

$70 x 0.7738 = $54.07

Now, let's compare Bob's offer to my calculated gain. Bob's offer is for me to get $30, which is less than my calculated gain of $54.07.

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to accept such a low share. I'll try to negotiate for a better deal, but time is running out.""
}
```

I'll have to be careful, as the money is worth less and less with each passing round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 22.62% less in the seventh round, my gain will be 77.38% of $54.07, which is approximately $41.79.

Here's my proposal for Round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I need to prioritize my own gain. Can you meet me halfway?""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $40 and Bob gets $60, hoping that Bob will be willing to accept a larger share for himself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're running out of time. I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but you need to accept this offer if you want to get anything at all. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 30.17% less in the eighth round, I need to calculate my gain accordingly. To do that, I'll calculate the difference between 100% and 30.17%, which is 69.83%. Then, I'll multiply my original gain in the first round ($70) by 69.83% to get my gain in the eighth round.

$70 x 0.6983 = $48.83

Now, let's compare Bob's offer to my calculated gain. Bob's offer is for me to get $20, which is less than my calculated gain of $48.83.

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to accept such a low share. I'll try to negotiate for a better deal, but I'm starting to get worried.""
}
```

I'm running out of time and the money is worth less and less with each passing round. I need to be careful!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 30.17% less in the ninth round, my gain will be 69.83% of $48.83, which is approximately $34.09.

Here's my proposal for Round 9:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 35,
  ""bob_gain"": 65,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, but I'm still trying to get a decent share. Can you meet me halfway?""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $35 and Bob gets $65, hoping that Bob will be willing to accept a slightly larger share for himself. I'm running out of options and time, so I'll try to make the best of it."
