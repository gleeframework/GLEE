"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""I'll start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's a fair deal, and we can both walk away satisfied. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to consider the new offer carefully. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I need to be strategic. However, splitting it evenly seems like a reasonable proposal, considering the circumstances.
