"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'll wait for a better offer. Inflation will hurt Alice more than me, so I have some leverage here. Let's see what happens next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\nI'll make a counteroffer that's slightly more favorable to me, but still reasonable. Since inflation will hurt Alice more, I'll try to take advantage of that.

{""bob_gain"": 420000, ""alice_gain"": 580000, ""message"": ""Your turn, Alice! Let's see if we can meet in the middle.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer, Bob. Let's close the deal and avoid further losses from inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI think this is a good time to accept the offer. The inflation is starting to take a significant toll on the value of the money, and Alice's offer is reasonable considering the circumstances. Further rounds will likely lead to even greater losses for both of us, so it's time to cut our losses and accept the deal."
