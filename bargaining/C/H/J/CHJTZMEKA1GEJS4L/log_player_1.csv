"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 400k. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000 and keeping 600,000 for myself. The message is a friendly opening offer, inviting Bob to consider it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous, I'll take more this time 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of my generosity.

I'll reject this offer. The money is worth less due to inflation, so I'd like to aim for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, due to inflation. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""You're trying to take too much. I'll give you 580k, but I'm keeping 420k for myself.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to account for the inflation and trying to regain some ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you in the middle, but I'm not going to give you a free ride 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to find a middle ground.

Considering the inflation, the money is worth significantly less now. I'll think carefully about this offer...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer, as it seems like a reasonable compromise given the current value of the money."
