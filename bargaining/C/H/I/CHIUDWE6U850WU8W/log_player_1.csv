"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose that I take $99 and Bob takes $1. I'm going to be greedy early on, hoping to secure the majority of the money before inflation kicks in too much. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer to get more, 50/50 is a fair deal. I'm not sure how inflation will affect Bob's offers in the future, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all.  Let's take the guaranteed split!"
