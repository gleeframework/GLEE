Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: Considering the value of money decreases with each round, I propose we divide the money as $60 for me and $40 for you. This maintains fairness while accounting for inflation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60
