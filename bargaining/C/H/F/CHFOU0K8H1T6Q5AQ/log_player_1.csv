"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the money and Bob gets 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider the effects of inflation. Since the money is worth 5% less for me now, I need to adjust my thinking accordingly.

In this round, the total amount is $100, but its value is 95% of the original value, so it's equivalent to $95 in the first round.

Bob's offer is 50% of $95, which is $47.50. Since the money is worth 20% less for Bob, this is equivalent to $60 in the first round.

I'm not sure if this is a good deal, but I'll play it safe and accept the offer.
