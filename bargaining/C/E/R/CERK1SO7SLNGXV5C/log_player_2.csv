Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that's slightly more favorable to me, but still reasonable for Alice. Since the money is worth 10% less to Alice in each round, I'll try to take advantage of that.

# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll reject this offer. Although Alice is framing it as a ""fair"" 50/50 split, the reality is that the money is worth 34.39% less to her than it was in the first round, while it's still worth the same to me. This means that, in real terms, I'd be getting a significantly better deal if I wait or make a counteroffer.
