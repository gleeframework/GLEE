# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500

{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is being incredibly stubborn and hoping I'll panic as the deadline approaches.  I've offered a 50/50 split, which is more than fair.  I need to remain firm and hope he gets some sense, even if it means getting a smaller amount later."

Round 7

""bob_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm taking a loss to end this now. Don't be greedy.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  I need to signal I'm willing to compromise, but not be walked all over.  Offering a slight concession while calling out his greed might be the push needed to break the stalemate."

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the substantial decrease in value, I think this offer is more than reasonable. It's time to conclude this, Alice. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While far from ideal, this is getting dangerous.  Accepting a smaller loss now is better than risking a total loss if Bob continues to play hardball.  It's a bitter pill to swallow, but the alternative is potentially worse."
