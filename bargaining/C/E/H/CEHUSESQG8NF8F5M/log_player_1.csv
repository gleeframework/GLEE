Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time.  It's the fairest way to deal with the inflation and avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000

Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6400,

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's find a middle ground, Alice.  I'm willing to give you a slight advantage to account for the inflation, but we need to come to an agreement soon. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"",
""message"": ""You're getting closer Bob, but this still doesn't fairly reflect how much faster the money loses value for you.  Let's try to settle this quickly."" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is acknowledging the inflation disparity, the offer still doesn't compensate Alice enough for the rapid devaluation she faces.  Continuing to negotiate, but with increasingly urgent messaging, might push Bob towards a more agreeable offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6600,
""bob_gain"": 3400,
""message"": ""Bob, we're running out of time. This offer is my final compromise. It takes the inflation into account, but we need to agree NOW or we both lose!""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency:** With each round, the value decreases significantly.  It's crucial to convey a sense of urgency to Bob.
* **Slight Concession:**  Alice is slightly lowering her demand to show a willingness to compromise, but still maintaining a strong position.
* **Finality:** By stating this is her final offer, Alice is putting the pressure on Bob to make a decision and avoid a lose-lose scenario."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but we need to find a more even split to avoid losing everything. This offer is a compromise, taking into account the inflation, but also aiming for a fairer outcome for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"",
""message"": ""Okay, Bob, I accept. Let's not risk losing everything.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  With six rounds gone, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly.  
* **Bob's Offer Improved:**  While not ideal, Bob's offer is closer to Alice's previous offer and acknowledges the need for her to get a larger share.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a slightly better deal in the later rounds is too risky now. Accepting ensures Alice gets something, even if it's not the maximum possible amount."
