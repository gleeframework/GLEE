I'm going for a high-stakes, high-risk strategy. I'm offering Bob a tiny amount, hoping he'll accept it in the first round. If he rejects, I'll adjust my strategy based on his risk aversion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

While it's a significant drop from my initial offer, taking 500,000 is still a lot better than getting nothing. The risk of further inflation and potentially getting even less in the next round is too high. It's time to take the guaranteed win."
