"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I'll take a big chunk but you'll get something too.  Hope you're not too greedy! ðŸ˜‰ 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting this offer as it seems quite unfair to me. Alice is taking the majority of the money, and I believe I can get a better deal in the next rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a more reasonable offer. Since the money is worth 5% less in each round, we should try to reach an agreement quickly. Here's my proposal:

{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and consider the inflation!""}"
