"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor, as I am the first to propose. This gives me the majority of the money while still offering Bob a small share. I believe this is a fair starting point, considering the potential for inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly worse for me than the first round, even with the inflation factored in. I'm not willing to accept such a drastic decrease in my share, especially since I have the opportunity to propose in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I propose a 85/15 split in my favor. While the inflation has affected the value of the money, I'm still willing to offer Bob a reasonable share. This allows me to maintain a majority of the money while ensuring that Bob receives a somewhat substantial amount. I hope this offer is more appealing to him than the previous round's proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While the inflation is starting to take a toll, I'm still not willing to accept a split that gives me less than 80%. I believe I can still negotiate a better deal for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}
```

I'm starting to feel the pressure of inflation, but I'm still trying to get the best deal I can. I'm willing to drop my share a bit more, to 75%, but I won't go lower than that. This offer still gives Bob a significant share, and I believe it's the best we can both do at this point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is more generous than the previous round, the inflation has severely impacted the value of my potential earnings. I'm still holding out for a better deal, especially considering that I have a few more rounds to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35}
```

I'm lowering my share again, but only to 65%. I'm starting to feel the pressure of inflation, but I believe I can still get a decent amount. This offer gives Bob a larger share than before, which might make it more appealing to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money, I'm accepting this offer.  It's a 50/50 split, and with only a few rounds left, I risk getting nothing at all.  It's time to cut my losses and accept what I can get."
