"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate too much""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $10,000 and leaving 40% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but still fair, right? 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money, I'm not as keen on taking 30% of the remaining amount. I'd like to make a counteroffer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not bad, but I'd like a bit more""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will make a new offer that's more to my liking."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the continued inflation, the money is worth even less now. I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's end this""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly larger share to Bob, but still trying to get a decent amount for myself."
