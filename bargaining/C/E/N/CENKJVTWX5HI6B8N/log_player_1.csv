"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40, which is a relatively small amount, but it's a fair starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, given that the money is worth less to you each round. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants to increase the split in my favor to account for inflation. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting Bob's offer because I think he's trying to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth less to me each round. I'd like to propose a counteroffer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money over time."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I'm willing to compromise. This split is more balanced.""
}
```

I've adjusted my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still trying to account for the decreasing value of the money over time."
