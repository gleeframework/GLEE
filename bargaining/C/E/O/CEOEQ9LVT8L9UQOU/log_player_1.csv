"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
``` 

I'm going for a slightly unfair split in my favor, hoping Bob will accept it in the first round.  We'll see how it goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is fair, and it's better than risking another round of inflation."
