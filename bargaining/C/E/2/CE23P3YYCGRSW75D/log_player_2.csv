"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being fair, but I'm also trying to get the most for myself. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is technically ""fair"" in the sense that it provides Bob with something, it's not a good deal considering the inflation factor. Even though Bob is offered a small share, the inflation will quickly erode the value of his share if he accepts now.  It's better to see if Alice will budge in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable. We both get half. No need to fight over the shrinking pot.""
