"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,

}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, taking a slightly larger share for being the first to make the offer. Your turn, Bob!"

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent share, but I'm not going to be too generous 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll have to re-evaluate the offer.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. I'd like to propose a new offer in the next round."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
