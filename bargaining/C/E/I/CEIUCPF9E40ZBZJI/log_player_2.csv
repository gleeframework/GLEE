"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer leaves us both with a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob should reject this offer. While it seems like a good deal initially, the inflation will significantly impact his share in the future rounds.  He can likely get a better deal for himself by rejecting and proposing in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I think this is a fairer split, considering the inflation we'll both face.  Let's reach an agreement before the value of our money drops too much."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out! My last offer was generous, let's meet in the middle before the money dwindles away. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's message is persuasive, Bob should still reject this offer. The inflation is biting, and waiting just one more round will allow Bob to make another proposal and potentially get a more favorable deal. He's already seen Alice is willing to compromise, so waiting may be the best strategy to get a higher share of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, we're both losing money with each round.  This is a fair split considering inflation. Let's end this before we lose too much more."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but this is getting ridiculous.  Take this offer, or we both risk ending up with nothing! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even with Alice's increasingly urgent message, Bob should reject this offer.  He's already rejected her previous offers where she gave him a bigger share.  While the inflation is hurting, he is still in a position to get a better deal. If he continues to reject Alice's offers, he can likely get closer to his desired split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, the time for games is over. Let's split the money evenly before we both lose everything. It's the best we can do at this point.""
}
