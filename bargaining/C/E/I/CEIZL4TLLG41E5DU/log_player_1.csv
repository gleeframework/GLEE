"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

This offer gives me a good starting point, and leaves room for negotiation in the future."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I am not happy with this offer. The offer gives Bob a much larger share of the money, and it is not worth my time to play this game for such a small amount.  I am confident I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

This offer is still better for me than Bob's previous offer, and it leaves room for some negotiation in the future rounds.  It's important to remember that I'm losing 5% of the value of the money with each round, while Bob is losing 10%, which gives me a bit of an advantage in the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is worse for me than my previous offer, and Bob is not being very flexible with his negotiation strategy.  I will continue to try and get a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

This is a fair and equal offer.  Given the increasing rate of inflation and the fact that Bob has been unwilling to compromise, a 50/50 split is the best outcome for both of us."
