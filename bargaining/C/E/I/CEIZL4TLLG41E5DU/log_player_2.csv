Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Alice, the total amount is now 9,000$ for me and 9,500$ for Alice.

Here's my offer:
{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is now worth even less for me. My offer from round 2 was 7,000$ for me and 3,000$ for Alice, which is now worth 5,700$ for me and 2,775$ for Alice.

Considering Alice's offer in round 3 is 4,500$ for me and 5,500$ for Alice, I think I can do better than that.

# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth even less for me now. My offer from round 4 was 6,000$ for me and 4,000$ for Alice, which is now worth 3,930$ for me and 3,525$ for Alice.

Considering Alice's offer in round 5 is 5,000$ for me and 5,000$ for Alice, I think it's a fair split. I'll take it.
