# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation risk, I propose a 50/50 split. This ensures both of us receive an equal amount while minimizing the impact of potential devaluation of our shares. I hope this offer is acceptable. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
