"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than a 70/30 split. Let's try a 50/50 split and see if we can find a more equitable solution. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{
