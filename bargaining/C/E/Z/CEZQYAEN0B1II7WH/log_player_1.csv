"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

This is a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."

# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer for Round 2. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll think about the relative values.

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 2.
