"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 55/45 is a better split, considering the inflation will affect you more than me. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""The inflation is working against us both. Let's meet in the middle -  55/45.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation is affecting you more, I think 58/42 is a fairer split now. 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is taking advantage of my diminishing returns. While he is correct that inflation is affecting me, his offer is getting worse each round. I need to hold firm to encourage a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 52,
""bob_gain"": 48,
""message"": ""This is getting us nowhere. I'm willing to come down slightly, but I need you to meet me closer to the middle.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're losing value every round, I'm willing to take a bit more. 60/40 is my new offer. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  This is getting dangerous. Bob is sticking to his guns, and while I'm losing value, I can't accept an offer this low. I need to signal I'm willing to lose some to get a fair deal.  A rejection now might make him reconsider a more drastic move on my end in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 45,
""bob_gain"": 55,
""message"": ""Okay, Bob, I'm serious now.  This offer hurts, but we're running out of time. I need you to be realistic about the impact on both of us if this falls through.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** It's time for a bolder move. Offering 45 is a significant drop, showing Bob I'm willing to lose to get a deal done. The message emphasizes the shared risk and urgency.  I'm hoping this pushes him towards a more reasonable agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out, but the inflation is on my side. I'll take a bit more. 62/38 is my new offer. 
# Alice gain: 38 
# Bob gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  This is brutal, but I can't accept an offer this low. Bob is clearly trying to exploit the situation, but with only a few rounds left, I need to hold my nerve. Accepting this would leave me with almost nothing after inflation. I'm hoping my previous concession combined with the increasing pressure of time will force him to reconsider in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 42,
""bob_gain"": 58,
""message"": ""Bob, this is ridiculous. We're about to both lose everything! I'm taking a significant hit with this offer, but it's the best I can do. Let's be reasonable and end this.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  I need to make another significant concession to signal my desperation and desire to end this before we both lose everything.  Offering 42 is a big jump from my previous offer, but hopefully, it shows Bob I'm serious about getting a deal done, even at a significant cost to myself. The message reinforces the urgency and emphasizes the disastrous consequences of not reaching an agreement."
