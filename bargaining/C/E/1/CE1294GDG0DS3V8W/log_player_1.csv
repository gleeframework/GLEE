"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and reasonable to start with. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the offer of 45-55, Bob is trying to take a slightly larger share. Considering the inflation effect, the 55 that Bob gains is actually worth 5% less than the 50 I would have gotten in the first round. I'll think about it...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer was 45-55, I'll try to counter with a slightly more favorable offer for myself. Here's my proposal for round 3:

```
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to Bob, considering the inflation effect is still in play!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob's trying to take an even larger share now! With the inflation effect, the 60 that Bob gains is worth a significant 14.26% less than the 50 I would have gotten in the first round. Considering this, I'll think about it...
