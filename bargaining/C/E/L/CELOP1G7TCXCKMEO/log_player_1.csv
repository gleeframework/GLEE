Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a generous offer.  I believe this will secure a quick agreement and we both get a good share of the money.  Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While Bob's offer is worse for me than my initial offer, it's still a significant amount of money, and the risk of getting nothing increases with each round. It's better to accept and secure the $8,000 now."
