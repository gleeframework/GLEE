I'm not going to accept being given only 100,000 dollars. Let's see what Alice proposes next."

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I think we can do better. I'm willing to compromise, but I still think my share should be a bit higher. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000

While I'd prefer more, this is a significant improvement over my last offer. It's time to end this and secure something for myself."
