"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take the lion's share, but you get a decent amount to start.  What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's tempting to accept, but it's too early in the game. I want to see if I can get a better deal!  The inflation risk is too high to accept such a lopsided offer so early on."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly.  It's a fair start and avoids any potential for disagreement.""}
