"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, where we both get $50."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the uneven split, but I'll consider it.
