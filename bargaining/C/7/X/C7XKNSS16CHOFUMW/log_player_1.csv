"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'm open to negotiations""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $60 and Bob getting $40. My message is a friendly opening offer, inviting Bob to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the 20% inflation, my gain of $70 is actually worth 80% of $70, which is $56.

I'm not thrilled with the offer, but it's a compromise. I'll accept it.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
