I'm taking a greedy approach in the first round! Since the money is worth less with each passing round, I want to maximize my share as much as possible right away.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

While I would prefer a larger share, I'm aware that with inflation, my potential gains will continue to decrease. This offer gives me a decent amount, and accepting it ensures I get something rather than risk getting nothing at all."
