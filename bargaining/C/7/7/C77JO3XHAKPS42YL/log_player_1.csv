"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need for further negotiations""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'm willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll evaluate the offer based on the initial value of the money.

In this case, I'll reject Bob's offer since I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not willing to give up 2/3 of the initial amount.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and the previous offer, I'll make a new proposal that takes into account the decreasing value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, considering the decreasing value of money""
}
```

I'm proposing a slightly more favorable split for myself, but still leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I'm still holding out for more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rate increasing, the value of Bob's gain is decreasing rapidly. I'll consider this in my decision.

Since the offer is slightly more favorable to Bob than my previous offer, I'll reject it. I'll try to make a new offer that takes into account the accelerating inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the rapid inflation, I'll make a new proposal that takes into account the decreasing value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""Last chance to make a deal, before the money's almost worthless""
}
```

I'm proposing a slightly more favorable split for myself, but still leaving room for negotiation."
