"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a fair share, let's settle""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the initial $100, which is $70, and Bob gets 30%, which is $30. I'm framing it as a fair share, hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly.  No need to keep playing! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to split it evenly, huh? That's a reasonable proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer, as I'd like to keep playing and try to get a better deal. Remember, the money is worth 10% less now, so the actual amounts are $45 for both of us. I'll wait for Bob's next offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slight edge, but I want more""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the remaining $100, which is $60, and Bob gets 40%, which is $40. I'm framing it as a generous offer, hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try this again. I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need a larger share to make it worth my while. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is pushing for a bigger share. Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer, as the reduced value of the money makes the numbers more appealing. With the 27.1% reduction in value, the actual amounts are $29.40 for me and $40.60 for Bob. I'll take the deal!"
