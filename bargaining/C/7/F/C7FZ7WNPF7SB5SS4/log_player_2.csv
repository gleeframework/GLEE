"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a fair starting point. Let's see what you think. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While this is a tempting offer, the inflation makes waiting potentially beneficial.  By rejecting, Bob gains the opportunity to propose a split that benefits him more."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I think this is a more equitable split, considering the potential for inflation.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a more fair split, considering that we both need to be compensated for the inflation risk. Let's try to come to an agreement. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While the offer is not ideal, the inflation rate is significant. Accepting ensures Bob gets at least some money, while rejecting risks getting nothing at all in the next round."
