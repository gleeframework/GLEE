"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $100 and leaving 40% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer...

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the absolute values of the gains. In this case, Bob is offering me 45 and himself 55.

I think I can do better than that. I'll reject this offer and wait for the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer was 45 for me and 55 for himself, I'll try to do better. I'll offer a slightly higher percentage for myself and a slightly lower percentage for Bob.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48}

I'm offering to take 52% of the remaining $100 and leaving 48% for Bob."
