"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $10,000 and leaving Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script. 60/40 in my favor this time.  What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The tables have turned!

I'll have to think carefully about this new offer. With inflation, my potential gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so the $4,000 I'd get is actually worth $3,600 in real terms.

I'm not sure if I want to accept a worse deal than the one I offered initially. But I also don't want to reject it and risk getting an even worse deal in the next round.

I'll decide to reject this offer.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less again, my potential gain is now worth 81% of what it was in the first round (90% of 90% = 81%).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""A slight adjustment, but still a fair deal!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time to get serious.  70/30 in my favor. Let's end this game. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really biting!

Let's calculate the real value of my potential gain: 70% of the original $10,000 is $7,000, and that's worth 27.1% less than the original $7,000 I'd get from the 70/30 split, so my gain is worth $7,000 x 0.721 = $5,047.

I'm not sure if I want to accept this deal. I'd be giving up a significant amount of value, but I also don't want to risk getting an even worse deal in the next round.

I'll decide to reject this offer.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, so my potential gain is worth 72.9% of what it was in the first round.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3600,
  ""bob_gain"": 6400,
  ""message"": ""Getting closer to a deal, but still not giving up!""
}
