Let's see if we can get a better deal!  I want to see what Alice is willing to do."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: A slight adjustment, but still a fair deal! 
# Bob gain: 5800 
# Alice gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice is still offering a lot, but I'm betting I can get a better deal by letting her make the next offer. With the inflation affecting her more, she might be more willing to concede."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""Time to get serious.  70/30 in my favor. Let's end this game.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting closer to a deal, but still not giving up! 
# Bob gain: 6400 
# Alice gain: 3600 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd love to keep pushing for more, Alice's inflation is taking a big bite out of her potential gains. Accepting this offer secures a solid gain for me, and it seems like the best we can do at this point."
