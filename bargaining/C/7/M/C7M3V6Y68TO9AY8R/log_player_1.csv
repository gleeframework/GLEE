"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
I'm going for a large share in the first round, hoping Bob will be tempted to take the offer. I know the money is worth less for him, but I want to see if he'll settle for a smaller portion early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer guarantees I get something. With inflation, the next round will be even less favorable for me, and there's no guarantee Bob will offer me anything at all."
