"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started, I'll give you a fair share, now it's your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000, which is 20% of the total amount. This way, I'll get $800,000, which is 80% of the total amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly! No need for complicated calculations. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less in the second round, my gain of $800,000 in the first round is now equivalent to $640,000 in the second round.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll get $500,000, which is more than my equivalent gain in the second round. I'll accept this offer.
