"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 7:3, it's a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself. The message is a friendly reminder that we can split the money in a reasonable ratio."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, let's see if you accept! 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting already!

Considering the new offer, I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that this is a good deal for me, especially with the inflation eating away at the value of the money. I'd like to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, let's meet in the middle!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share, hoping that he'll accept this compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more. Let's see if you can do better! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll!

Considering the new offer, I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think this is a good opportunity to accept a fair split, and I don't want to risk going to another round with the value of the money continuing to decrease."
