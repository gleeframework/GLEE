"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and reasonable for the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Not a great start to the negotiations!

I'll consider Bob's offer, but I'm not sure I want to give him a 60% share. I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","In round 3, the money is worth 5% less than in round 2. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}

I'm proposing a slightly better deal for myself, but still a reasonable compromise."
