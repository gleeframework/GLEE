Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split this more evenly, I think this is a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $400,000 is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $320,000.

I'm not sure if Bob's offer is fair, considering the inflation. I'd rather wait for a better offer.
