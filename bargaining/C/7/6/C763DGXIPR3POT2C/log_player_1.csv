"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can do better than that, Alice. I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not going to give you the majority of the money. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is not very generous, considering the inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and hope to do better in the next round. The money is worth 5% less now, so I'm not willing to accept a 30-70 split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think this is a fairer split, considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my proposal to a 45-55 split, which takes into account the decreasing value of the money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to get impatient. I think I'm being generous, considering the inflation. Don't expect me to give you more than this. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is still not very generous, and the inflation is eating away at the value of the money.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer as well. The 40-60 split is still not acceptable to me, especially considering the inflation has reduced the value of the money by 14.26% from the original amount. I'll try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{

  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit worried about the time running out, Bob. This is my best offer so far, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my proposal to a 52-48 split, trying to find a compromise that works for both of us."

# Bob's message: I'm not getting any younger, Alice. I'm not going to back down now. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's getting a bit testy, but I'm not giving in yet.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer as well. The 45-55 split is not acceptable to me, especially considering the inflation has reduced the value of the money by 22.62% from the original amount. I'll try to negotiate further, but I'm starting to get a bit worried about the time running out."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.

```

  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not going to give in to your demands, Bob. I'm willing to take a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to let you walk all over me.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my proposal to a 55-45 split, trying to take a slightly stronger stance and see if Bob will meet me halfway."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to think you're not serious about dividing the money fairly, Alice. This is my last offer before I start getting really aggressive. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's getting more aggressive, but I'm not backing down.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer as well. The 48-52 split is still not acceptable to me, especially considering the inflation has reduced the value of the money by 30.17% from the original amount. I'm starting to get a bit concerned that Bob is trying to bully me into accepting a bad deal. I'll try to hold out for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not going to back down, Bob. I'm willing to take a 60-40 split, but I'm not going to give in to your previous demands.""
}
```

I'm reverting back to my original proposal from round 1, but with a slightly more assertive tone. I'm willing to take a 60-40 split, but I'm not going to accept anything less."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Fine, Alice. I've had enough of your games. I'll meet you at 50-50, but don't think this means I'm going to let you get the better of me. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's finally willing to meet me at 50-50? It's about time!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer. A 50-50 split is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to settle for it. I'm glad we can finally agree on a division of the money."
