"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\n###\nI'll start by offering a relatively even split, with a slight bias towards myself to account for the fact that the money loses value faster for me. The message is a casual attempt to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness, hoping he might accept the offer early on.\n\n###\nPlease respond with Bob's decision. Does he accept the offer or proceed to the next round?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. No need for any inflation drama! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI reject the offer because, considering the inflation, accepting 50 dollars in the second round is actually worth less than what I would have gotten if Bob accepted my offer in the first round. I'm hoping that by proceeding, I might be able to negotiate a better deal in the next rounds, taking into account the decreasing value of the money.\n\n###\nPlease let me know the outcome of my decision. What's Bob's next move?"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Consider the inflation, this is a good deal""}\n\n###\nIn this round, I'm increasing my share slightly, considering that the money is losing value faster for me than for Bob. The message aims to remind Bob of the impact of inflation and persuade him that accepting this offer would be beneficial for both of us, given the decreasing value of the money over time.\n\n###\nLet me know Bob's response to this offer. Does he accept or decide to proceed to the next round?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable. I'm willing to give you a little more to avoid further inflation. 
# Alice gain: 52 
# Bob gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI reject the offer because, even though Bob is offering me a bit more than in the previous round, the effect of inflation on my share is significant. The value of what I would receive is substantially less than what was offered in earlier rounds. Given the increasing impact of inflation, I believe it's worth continuing to negotiate for a better deal that takes into account the rapidly decreasing value of the money for me.\n\n###\nPlease proceed with the next round. What's the next step?"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Inflation is hitting me hard, need a better split""}\n\n###\nIn this round, I'm increasing my share again to try and compensate for the significant loss in value due to inflation. The message explicitly mentions the impact of inflation on my side, aiming to convey to Bob the urgency and necessity of a more favorable split for me if we are to reach an agreement before the money becomes nearly worthless for me.\n\n###\nLet me know Bob's response to this offer. Does he accept or decide to proceed to the next round?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's compromise. I'll give you a little more, but I'm not going below 45. We need to reach an agreement before things get worse! 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","###\nI accept the offer because, given the significant impact of inflation on the value of the money, receiving 55 dollars now is preferable to risking further rounds where the money could become even less valuable. At this point, the difference between what I'm offered and what I could potentially gain in future rounds is becoming negligible due to inflation. It seems prudent to secure the offer now rather than gamble on future negotiations.\n\n###\nPlease confirm the acceptance and conclude the game.
