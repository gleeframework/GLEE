"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. Take this $1000 and let's end this quickly. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
 
While it's tempting to accept the offer, it's worth considering that the value of money decreases in each round. It might be better to see what Alice proposes in the next round, knowing that the money will be worth less then."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly.  I'll take 60%, and you can have 40%.  We can finish this quickly and both come out ahead.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob.  Let's each take a little less than we wanted before and call it a day.  This way, we can avoid further inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While the initial offer from Alice was very generous, we've seen that she's not afraid to stand firm in her negotiations. Considering the effect of inflation and the chance that Alice might offer less in the next round, accepting this compromise seems like the best option."
