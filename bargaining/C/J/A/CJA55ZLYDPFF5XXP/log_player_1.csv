I'm going to try to be as fair as possible, but also secure a good share for myself. I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor, hoping Bob will accept.  We'll see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much less favorable than my initial proposal, and while the money is worth less for both of us, I believe I can still get a better deal if I push for another round.  I'll take the chance and see if I can get a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm taking a more aggressive approach this time, aiming for a 70/30 split in my favor. The value of the money is decreasing, and I'm still confident I can secure a better deal than Bob's last offer. Let's see if he bites."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough decision, but with the significant inflation, I need to consider the decreasing value of the money. Bob's offer is less than what I proposed, but it's still a decent share, especially given the inflation. It's wiser to accept and secure a substantial amount rather than risk getting less in the next round."
