"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, but I'm open to negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for Bob, he's essentially offering me 5000 * 0.8 = 4000 in real value, while I'd be getting 5000.

I'd rather have more, so I'll reject this offer. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. I'll try to increase my share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, but a bit more to me""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take a risk, I'll take less 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is getting intense! Since the money is worth 48.8% less for Bob, he's essentially offering me 3000 * 0.516 (1 / 0.9542) = 1551.2 in real value, while I'd be getting 3000.

I'm not sure if I should take a risk and accept this offer, but I'm not sure if I can do better. I'll take it.
