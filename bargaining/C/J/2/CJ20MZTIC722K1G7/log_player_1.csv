"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer and message to Bob in JSON format:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good starting point""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and give Bob $4,000, with a message suggesting that a 60-40 split is a reasonable starting point for our negotiations. Let me know how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split things a bit more evenly, considering I get to propose in this round and the value decreases with time. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll respond with a JSON object as requested:


{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can get a better deal, and I'm willing to take the risk of going to the next round despite the decreasing value of the money. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer and message to Bob in JSON format:


{
  ""alice_gain"": 5800,
  ""bob_gain"": 4200,

}\n\nI'm offering to take $5,800 and give Bob $4,200, with a message explaining that I'm willing to compromise due to the decreasing value of the money, but I still think I deserve a slightly larger share. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is ticking and the pot is shrinking.  This is a very fair split considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}I'm rejecting Bob's offer again, as I still believe I can negotiate a better deal, despite the decreasing value of the money. The split is getting closer to 50-50, but I'm willing to take the risk and see what happens in the next round."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 5600,
  ""bob_gain"": 4400,
  ""message"": ""We're getting closer, but I still want a bit more. Let's settle this before the money loses more value""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be real.  The value is plummeting. This is the fairest and most logical option - take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}I've decided to accept Bob's offer of a 50-50 split. Given the significant decrease in value due to inflation, I think it's indeed the fairest and most logical option at this point. Continuing to negotiate further might result in even greater losses for both of us, so I'm willing to settle for an equal split."
