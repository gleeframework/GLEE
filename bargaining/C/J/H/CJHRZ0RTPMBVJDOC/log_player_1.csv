I'm proposing to keep 900,000$ and give Bob 100,000$.  Let's see if he'll accept!"

# Bob gain: 900000

I'm still rejecting.  Bob is trying to get a bigger and bigger slice of the pie, and while I'm not getting much right now, I'm hoping to hold out for a better deal.  The inflation hurts, but I'm willing to take the risk."

```

I'm proposing a split of 600,000 for me and 400,000 for Bob.  I'm getting desperate, but I'm still hoping to get a fair share.  I'm aware of the inflation, but I need to try and secure something for myself."

The inflation is really starting to hurt, but I still can't accept this offer. It feels like we're getting closer to a stalemate, and I need to try and hold out for a better deal.  Maybe I can negotiate a better offer in the next round."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split. With the inflation taking a serious toll, I think this is the fairest way to divide the remaining money. This offer is a compromise and hopefully will be accepted by Bob."
