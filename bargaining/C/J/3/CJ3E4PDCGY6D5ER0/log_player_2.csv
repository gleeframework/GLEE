"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair.  I'll take a slightly bigger share, but you get a good amount too. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think we should split it closer to 50/50, considering the inflation, I'll take a bit more.""}\n\n###\n\nNow it's Alice's turn to decide whether to accept or reject my offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable.  We both lose money with each round, so a 50/50 split seems the most fair now. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI think a 50/50 split is fair, considering the inflation. It's better to accept this offer rather than risking further loss of value in the next rounds."
