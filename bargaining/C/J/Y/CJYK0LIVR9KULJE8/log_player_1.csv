"Round 1

I propose that I take $9,000 and Bob takes $1,000.  I'm going for a big chunk right away, hoping Bob will take it to avoid further risk of inflation.  Let's see what he decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. It's still too lopsided in his favor, and while the inflation is a concern, I'm not convinced that the 5% reduction is enough to make his offer worthwhile. I'm hoping to get a more even split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

I'm offering a more balanced split this time.  I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still aiming for a significant share of the money.  We both need to be reasonable to reach an agreement before inflation eats away too much of our potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. While the inflation is starting to make a significant impact on the money, I still think this offer is too uneven in his favor. I'm hoping we can find a more equitable solution before the inflation gets completely out of control."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm increasing my share slightly, but still offering a significant amount to Bob.  I'm hoping that with the increasing inflation, he'll be more motivated to reach an agreement.  Let's see if we can find common ground this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer.  The inflation is getting serious, but I'm not willing to accept a deal that's so heavily in his favor.  I'm holding out for a fairer split.  The stakes are getting higher with each round, and I'm hoping Bob will realize he needs to be more reasonable."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm proposing an even split. Inflation is a real threat now, and we both risk getting nothing if we keep rejecting offers. This is the most fair solution for both of us, considering the circumstances. Let's end this game and share the money equally."
