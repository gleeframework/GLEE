Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'm not thrilled about the reduced value of the money, but I'll consider Bob's offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better. I'll wait for another proposal that gives me a higher value."

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, but I'll still give you a decent chunk, considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing rapidly!

I'll think carefully about Bob's new offer. Considering the inflation, I'll have to be cautious. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. I'll take $3,000, and Bob will take $7,000. It's not the best deal, but it's better than nothing, and I don't want to risk waiting for another proposal that might be even worse."
