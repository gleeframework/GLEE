"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good start""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering Bob 40 dollars, which is a relatively generous offer, considering I'm Alice and I want to get the most out of this deal. The message is a gentle nudge to make Bob think that this is a fair offer, and that we can both walk away with a good amount of money. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a larger share, but that's a bit much for me.  How about a 55/45 split? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'm not happy with Bob's offer, I think I deserve more than 45 dollars. Since the money is worth the same for me, I don't have any pressure to accept this offer. I'll reject it and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round.\n\n###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nLet's see how Bob responds to my rejection!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nIn this round, I'll try to make a slightly more generous offer to Bob, but still not too generous, considering the money is worth the same for me. Since Bob's offer of a 55/45 split was not acceptable to me, I'll try to meet him halfway between my original offer and his offer. Let's see how he responds!\n\n###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 57.5, ""bob_gain"": 42.5, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 57.5/42.5 is a fair compromise""}\n\n###\n\nI'm hoping that this offer will be more to Bob's liking, and that we can conclude the game with this round. Fingers crossed!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is getting ridiculous. It's a 50/50 split or we both lose out. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I think Bob is starting to feel the pressure of inflation, and his offer of a 50/50 split is a clear indication of that. Since the money is still worth the same for me, I'm not too keen on accepting this offer. I think I can still get a better deal, considering Bob's desperation is growing. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round.\n\n###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nLet's see how Bob responds to my rejection!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll try to make an offer that takes into account Bob's growing desperation due to inflation. Since he's already offered a 50/50 split, I'll try to make a slightly more generous offer than my previous one, but still not quite meeting him at 50/50. I want to make him think that I'm willing to compromise, but still get the better end of the deal.\n\n###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 56, ""bob_gain"": 44, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but 50/50 is too much. How about 56/44?""}\n\n###\n\nI'm hoping that this offer will be more to Bob's liking, considering the pressure of inflation is mounting on him. Let's see how he responds!"
