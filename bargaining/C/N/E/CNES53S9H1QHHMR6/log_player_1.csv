"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

I'm going for a very lopsided offer in the first round. My reasoning is:

* **High Stakes:**  This is a high-stakes game with a lot of money on the line. Bob might be more willing to accept a small gain rather than risk getting nothing at all.
* **Setting a Precedent:** By starting with a strong offer, I hope to establish a pattern where Bob feels compelled to make a more ""fair"" offer in the next round.

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I would have preferred more, it's a significantly fairer offer than the previous round and getting $500,000 is better than risking getting nothing at all. This game is about maximizing my chances of getting something, and this offer does that."
