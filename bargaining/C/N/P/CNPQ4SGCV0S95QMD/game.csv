,,,Bob,1,reject
100000.0,900000.0,"I think we can be more fair here. Let's split the money closer to 90/10, with me getting the bigger share. I believe this is a more reasonable starting point.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
950000.0,50000.0,"I'm willing to come down a bit, but I still believe a 95/5 split is fair considering the inflation affecting your share. Let's reach a deal before things get worse for both of us.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
200000.0,800000.0,"Let's find a compromise closer to 80/20. We both know inflation is hurting me, but I'm willing to be flexible if you are too.  It's better to reach an agreement now than risk losing even more.",Bob,4,

900000.0,100000.0,"We're getting close to the end, Bob. I'm willing to go down to 90/10, but I won't go lower.  This is a fair compromise considering the inflation affecting your share.  Let's not let the money slip away.",Alice,5,

300000.0,700000.0,"Alice, we're getting closer to the end of the game. I'm willing to split the money at a 70/30 ratio, with me getting the larger share. This is a more reasonable split considering the inflation hitting my side. Let's work together and find a solution before time runs out!",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
850000.0,150000.0,"Bob, we're running out of time.  I'm willing to go down to 85/15, but that's my final offer.  If we don't agree soon, we both risk getting nothing. Let's be rational and end this game with something.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, we're in a tight spot now. Inflation is really hurting my share. I propose a 60/40 split, which is still a good deal for both of us considering the circumstances.  Let's make a deal before the money is worth even less!",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
800000.0,200000.0,"Bob, we're getting close to the end. I'm willing to go down to 80/20, but I can't go lower.  It's better to take something than nothing at this point. Let's end this game with a deal.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Alice, we're down to the wire. Inflation has taken its toll, but it's time for a fair compromise.  I propose we split the money evenly, 50/50.  It's better than nothing, and it's a fair way to end this game. Let's be reasonable and come to an agreement.",Bob,10,
