"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you 40, you can give me 60""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40, which is 40% of the original $100, and keeping $60 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try again, 50-50 split this time! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 5% reduction in value for me, I'll receive $50, which is worth $50 * 0.95 = $47.50, and Bob will receive $50, which is worth $50 * 0.9 = $45.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
