"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting fair, but we both know the money will depreciate with each round. Let's get this done! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's tempting to accept this early offer, but the inflation will affect Alice much more than me. I'm going to hold out and see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'm offering a more even split, considering the inflation. Let's be reasonable and end this quickly.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not going to accept a deal that gives me less than 60% of the money.  Let's get this done before the value of the money drops even further. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a more even split, the value of the money is declining quickly, and it's not worth risking a deal that gives me a good chunk. Accepting this offer will secure a substantial sum for me."
