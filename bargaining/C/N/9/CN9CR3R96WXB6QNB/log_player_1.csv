Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn, Alice.  This offer is better for me, but time is money, especially for you! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""The tables have turned, Bob. I'm feeling the inflation pinch, so let's make this quick.""

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be realistic. This offer is still good for you, and the clock is ticking. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the faster inflation rate affecting me.  While the offer isn't terrible, I'm confident I can still secure a better deal in the remaining rounds. Bob needs to be reminded that the clock is ticking for him too."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Okay Bob, let's stop playing games. This is a fair deal considering the inflation, and we both need to settle this quickly.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous. Take this offer before inflation eats up all the profit! 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:** The inflation is severely cutting into my potential gains. While this offer isn't ideal, it's becoming increasingly risky to keep rejecting. Bob is likely to continue pushing for a larger share, and the difference between this offer and a potentially worse one in later rounds is no longer worth the risk of getting nothing."
