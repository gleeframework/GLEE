"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start with!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $1,000,000 equally, with each of us getting $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have less, I'll take more 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer...

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'm effectively getting $400,000, which is $100,000 less than my original proposal.

Bob is offering me $400,000, which is a significant reduction from my original ask. I'm not thrilled about it, but I'm also not eager to risk going to the next round and potentially getting even less.

I'll decide to accept Bob's offer for now. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
