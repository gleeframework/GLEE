"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000, leaving Bob with 20%. I'm hoping this is a reasonable starting point!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  It's the fairest way to start. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth 20% less in the second round, I'll have to consider that when evaluating the offer. With the current inflation rate, $5000 is equivalent to $4000 in the first round.

Considering this, I think Bob's offer is a bit too generous, especially since I was already willing to accept an 80% split in the first round. I'd like to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less in the third round, I'll have to adjust my offer accordingly. In this round, $5000 is equivalent to $4000 in the first round.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""You were too generous last round, so I'm taking a bit more this time.""
}
```

I'm hoping this offer is more to Bob's liking!"
