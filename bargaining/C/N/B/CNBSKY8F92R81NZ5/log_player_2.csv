"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, Bob. A little more for me considering the inflation rate against me. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\n### I don't think this is a fair split, considering I'm losing 10% each round and Alice is only losing 5%. I'll take my chances and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","### {""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation rates, I think I deserve a bigger share. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, let's be real.  The inflation is hurting us both. A 50/50 split is the fairest option at this point. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n### {""decision"": ""reject""}
### I still think I deserve a bigger share due to the higher inflation rate affecting me. A 50/50 split doesn't account for the difference in our inflation rates. I'll hold out for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","### {""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""I understand we're both losing value, but my losses are steeper. I'll come down a bit from my previous offer, but I still think I deserve more than half.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer. It acknowledges your faster depreciation, but also ensures I'm not getting a raw deal.  Let's be logical and end this here before we both lose more. 
# Bob gain: 5400 
# Alice gain: 4600 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}
### I think this offer is more reasonable, considering the difference in inflation rates. I've lost a significant amount of value already, and I don't want to risk losing even more. I'll accept this offer and end the game."
