"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly, considering I'm starting""
}
```

I'm proposing that I receive $60 and Bob receives $40, with a message suggesting that since I'm starting, this split is a fair beginning point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering inflation, let's be rational 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because, despite the inflation, I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the next round. The difference in inflation impact between us means I'm losing value faster, so I want to try and maximize my gain sooner rather than later."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 58,
  ""bob_gain"": 42,
  ""message"": ""Countering your offer, factoring in inflation""
}
```

Considering the inflation impact, where my gain is worth 20% less and Bob's gain is worth 10% less than the original, I'm making a counteroffer. I'm trying to find a middle ground that acknowledges Bob's previous offer but also tries to maximize my gain given the decreasing value of the money for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is hitting you harder, I'll take a bit more 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again because, although inflation is indeed hitting me harder, accepting this offer would mean I'm giving in to a worse deal due to the pressure of inflation rather than the fairness of the split. I'll try to push for a better deal, hoping that Bob might still be willing to compromise."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 5:


{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Last push for a fairer split, inflation is killing me""
}


Given the significant impact of inflation on my potential gain, I'm making one last attempt to secure a deal that's closer to my original proposal. I'm hoping that Bob will recognize the value of ending the game now, rather than risking further inflation, and accept this slightly more favorable offer."
