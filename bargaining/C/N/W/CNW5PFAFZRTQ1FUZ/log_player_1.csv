"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $10,000, which is a pretty good deal, if I do say so myself!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Not bad, but I can do better than that. Think about it! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure if Bob's offer is really better than mine, considering the inflation effect. If I accept this offer, I'll be getting 30% of the original $10,000, which is less than my initial offer of 60%. I'll wait for a better offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Time for a new proposal!

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob! Let's make a deal!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This way, I'll get 42% of the original $10,000, and Bob will get 58%. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Getting closer, but I'm still not satisfied. You can do better than that! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

Considering the inflation effect, Bob's offer is actually a good one. He's offering me 45% of the original $10,000, but due to inflation, that's equivalent to 45% of the original amount multiplied by 0.848 (since 100% - 48.8% = 51.2%, or 0.512, and 45% of that is 0.848). That's a bit more than my original offer of 42% of the original amount (which is 0.6). However, I'm still not convinced that this is the best deal I can get. I'll wait for a better offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Time to make another move!

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
 ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle, Bob! No more negotiating!""
}
```

I'm making a bold move by proposing a 50-50 split. This way, we both get an equal share of the original $10,000, and I'll get 50% of the original amount, which is equivalent to 50% of the original amount multiplied by 0.848 (due to inflation). Let's see if Bob will accept this fair offer!"
