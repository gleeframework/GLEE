# Alice's message: I see you're eager to get a bigger share, but I'm not willing to give up that much. How about we meet in the middle?

""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. I'm losing a huge chunk of value with every round. You said 'fair' before, but 60-40 in my favor is more than fair considering the circumstances.""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're getting desperate, but I'm not going to give in that easily. My offer is still more generous than yours was in the first round. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit my disadvantage with the inflation, and she's betting I'll panic. While the offer is tempting,  I still have some rounds to negotiate, and giving in now will only embolden her further. It's a risky move, but I need to show her I'm serious about getting a larger share."

""alice_gain"": 450000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm not buying it. I think you'll take what you can get at this point. My offer is still better than nothing, which is what you'll get if we don't agree soon. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is right, my bluff has been called.  While this is significantly less than I wanted, rejecting this offer would be incredibly risky. The inflation is eating away at my potential gains, and there's no guarantee Alice will offer me anything better in the remaining rounds. It's a bitter pill to swallow, but better to take a reduced share than risk getting nothing at all."
