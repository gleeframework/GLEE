"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you 40% and keep 60%""
}
```

I'm starting with a relatively fair split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you the majority, but I'm not being too generous 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the money is worth less, and Bob is offering me a smaller share. Considering the decreasing value of money, I'll have to be more cautious.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal. My response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not bad, but I'd like a bit more, considering the inflation. I'll wait for a better offer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect and Bob's previous offer, I'll make a new proposal that takes into account the decreasing value of money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'll take a bigger share this time. 80% is a fairer split, don't you think?""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm still trying to hold on to some value 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","With the increased inflation effect, the money is worth even less, and Bob is still trying to hold on to a significant share. Considering the decreasing value of money, I'll have to be more aggressive in my negotiation.

I'll reject this offer and try to get an even better deal. My response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not enough, Bob. I'll need a bigger share to make it worth my while, considering the inflation.""

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: I'm not giving in, Alice. You're going to have to make a better offer if you want to get anything from me 
# Alice gain: 95 
# Bob gain: 5 
Do you accept this offer?","With the extremely high inflation effect, the money is almost worthless. Bob is trying to squeeze the last bit of value out of the deal. Considering the dire situation, I'll have to accept this offer to get any money at all.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Fine, Bob. I'll take the 95%. It's better than walking away with nothing.""
}
```"
