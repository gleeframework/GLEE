"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. It's a good starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. With the inflation, my $300,000 is now worth even less than I initially thought. But I don't want to give up too much to Bob either.

I'll reject this offer.

```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a good share and leaving some room for negotiation."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on my offer, and Bob is trying to take advantage of it. However, I'm not convinced that I should give up that much more to Bob.

I'll reject this offer.

```

Round 5

{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,

}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive and take a bigger share, but I'm also willing to compromise and give Bob a 50/50 split."
