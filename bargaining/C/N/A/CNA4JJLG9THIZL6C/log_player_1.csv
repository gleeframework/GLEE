"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less for Bob, I'll have to reassess the value of the offer.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the offer in terms of the actual amount of money.

Bob's offer is 4000 for me, which is worth 80% of the original 5000 I proposed in the first round. This is a bit less than I initially offered, but it's still a decent compromise.

I'll accept this offer.
