  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or reject the offer!"

# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's trying to negotiate a better deal for himself, but I'm not sure if it's worth it.

```

# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's trying to squeeze out a better deal for himself, but I'm not impressed.

```

  ""message"": ""No way, Bob! I'm not getting 30% of the money. I'll do better than that!""
}
