"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\n###\nI'll start by offering a division of $60 for myself and $40 for Bob. I've attached a message saying ""Let's be fair"" to convey a sense of cooperation and mutual benefit. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want to be fair, but this split accounts for the money losing value over time. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI've decided to reject Bob's offer. Although the money is losing value over time for me, I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the next round. Bob's offer of $45 for me and $55 for himself doesn't seem fair considering the initial proposal I made. I'll take my chances and make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle""}\n\n###\nI'll make a new proposal, taking into account the decreasing value of the money for me. I'll offer $57 for myself and $43 for Bob, which is closer to the middle ground. My message ""Let's meet in the middle"" aims to convey a sense of compromise and willingness to find a mutually acceptable solution. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The value of the money is decreasing rapidly. This is my last offer. 
# Alice gain: 43 
# Bob gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nConsidering the rapidly decreasing value of the money for me, I've decided to accept Bob's offer. With the money losing 27.1% of its value already, I risk losing even more if I reject this offer and the game continues. Bob's offer of $43 for me and $57 for himself seems more reasonable at this point, especially since he claims it's his last offer. I'll accept this deal to secure the remaining value."
