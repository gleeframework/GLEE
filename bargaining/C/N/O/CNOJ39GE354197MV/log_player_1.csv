"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

This is my initial offer: I propose keeping 90 dollars and giving Bob 10 dollars.  Since I'm starting, I think it's reasonable to offer a larger share for myself, knowing that the value of the money will decrease with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

Since Bob rejected my offer and the money is worth less now, I'm offering a slightly lower share for myself, hoping to reach an agreement before the value decreases further."

I reject Bob's offer. Although it's better than getting nothing in the later rounds, I'm still hoping for a better deal for myself.  The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, but I think we can still find a compromise that's more favorable."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

I'm lowering my share again, but I still believe I can get a larger portion of the money.  I'm hoping Bob will recognize that the value of the money is decreasing with each round and that we're both better off reaching an agreement soon."

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. While the value of the money has decreased significantly, I believe we can still find a more equitable split.  The game is nearing its end, and if we don't reach an agreement, we'll both get nothing. I'm hoping Bob will consider a more balanced offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

This is my final offer. The value of the money is rapidly decreasing, and we're running out of time. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, as it's a fair compromise considering the current circumstances."

I accept Bob's offer. The value of the money is now significantly lower for both of us, and it's better to get something than risk getting nothing at all."
