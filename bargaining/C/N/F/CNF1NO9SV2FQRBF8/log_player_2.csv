"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, Bob. A little more than half seems reasonable considering the inflation we're facing.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Your turn to feel the inflation, Alice. I'll take the slightly larger share this time.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be real. The longer this goes on, the less we both gain. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical option. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
