Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split the money 9:1 in my favor.  This gives you a small share while ensuring I get the majority of the value before inflation kicks in. 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{
