"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself, with a message encouraging Bob to accept the offer as it's a relatively fair split. Let me know what Bob decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, but let's be realistic. This offer won't be as good next round. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{

  ""alice_gain"": 5800,
  ""bob_gain"": 4200,
  ""message"": ""Counteroffer, considering inflation""
}

I've taken into account the inflation and Bob's previous offer, so I'm making a counteroffer that's slightly more favorable to myself, but still reasonable. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
