"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you $4,000 and take $6,000 for myself. I'm open to negotiations if you don't like it.""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think a 60/40 split in my favor is more fair, considering the upcoming rounds. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my $6,000 in the first round is now worth $5,400 in the second round, and Bob's $4,000 is still worth $4,000.

Considering Bob's offer, I think he's trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a better deal. I'd rather not accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my $5,400 from the previous round is now worth $4,860 in the third round. I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to give you a slightly higher share this round. Take $5,500 and let's move forward.""
}
```"
