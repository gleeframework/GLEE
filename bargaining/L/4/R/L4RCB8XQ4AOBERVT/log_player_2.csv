Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's offer was 40/60, I'll try to counter with a slightly more favorable ratio for myself. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effects of inflation, my gain of 30$ is worth 9.75% less than my gain of 40$ in the first round, which is 40 * 0.9075 = 36.3$. However, Alice's gain of 70$ is worth 19% less than her gain of 60$ in the first round, which is 60 * 0.81 = 48.6$. This offer is not as favorable to me as Alice's previous offer of 40/60. I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the effects of inflation, I'll make an offer that takes into account the reduced value of money. Since my gain of 36.3$ in the previous round is the maximum I'm willing to accept, I'll aim for a similar ratio. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 35, ""alice_gain"": 65}"
