Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want a larger share. I'm proposing a compromise - 52/48 in my favor. This is a better deal for you than last round considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200
