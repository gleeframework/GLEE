"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering the money depreciates faster for me. Let's end this now. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Let's think about why this is a good move even though it seems like Bob is offering a ""fair"" deal:

* **Future Rounds:** If we reject this offer, we get to propose in the next round. While the money will be worth less, we can likely secure a better deal than 40/60.
* **Bob's Depreciation:**  Remember, Bob's money depreciates faster than ours. Each round he's getting more desperate to make a deal.  

By rejecting, we leverage the time pressure against Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""This is my final offer, Bob. It's a reasonable split considering the depreciation. Let's close this out.""
}
```

**Strategy:**

* **Increased Share:**  We're pushing for a slightly better split than our initial 60/40 offer, taking advantage of Bob's increasingly desperate position.
* **Finality:**  By framing this as our ""final offer,"" we create a sense of urgency and put the pressure on Bob to accept a deal now."
