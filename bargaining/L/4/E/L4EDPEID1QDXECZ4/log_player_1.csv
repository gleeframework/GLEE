Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This is a very aggressive offer, but it's the best way for me to maximize my share while still offering Bob something.  It's unlikely he'll accept, but I need to see how he plays."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still extremely generous to him, and I don't see any reason to accept it. I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but I'm still aiming for a large portion of the money.  Bob's offer in the last round showed he's willing to compromise, so I'm hoping he'll accept this one."
