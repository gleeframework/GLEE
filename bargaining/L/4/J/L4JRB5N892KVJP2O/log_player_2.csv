Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise, but I still believe I deserve a slightly larger share. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the pressure, but I'm not convinced by your last offer. I'll meet you halfway between my last offer and yours. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Reasoning:

* **Time Pressure:**  With only 7 rounds remaining, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. Accepting a less-than-ideal offer now is better than risking getting nothing.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  While Alice's offer isn't perfect, it's closer to my preferred outcome than her previous offers. Continuing to negotiate might yield marginally better results, but the risk of losing everything increases significantly with each passing round.
* **Strategic Compromise:** Accepting this offer demonstrates a willingness to compromise, which could be beneficial in future interactions, should there be any.

While I could hold out for a slightly better deal, the potential gains are outweighed by the very real risk of walking away with nothing.
