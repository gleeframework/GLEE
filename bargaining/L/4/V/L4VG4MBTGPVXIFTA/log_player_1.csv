"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. We can always negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000. I'm framing this as a ""fair"" split, hoping to set a positive tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous with the initial split. I'll take a bigger share this time. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my $600,000 is now worth 95% of its original value, so it's now worth $570,000. Bob's $400,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, so it's now worth $360,000.

I'm not thrilled about Bob's new offer, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than a 70-30 split. I'll wait for his next proposal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my $600,000 from the first round is now worth 95% of its original value, so it's now worth $570,000. I'll aim to get a better share this time.

Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the initial offer. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than Bob's previous offer. I'm framing it as a compromise, hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer to my target, but I'm still not satisfied. I'll take a bit more this time. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my $600,000 from the first round is now worth 85.74% of its original value, so it's now worth $513,440. I'll consider Bob's new offer.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than a 45-55 split. I'll wait for his next proposal and see if he's willing to meet me in the middle or better."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my $600,000 from the first round is now worth 85.74% of its original value, so it's now worth $513,440. I'll aim to get a better share this time.

Here's my new proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
 ""message"": ""I'm willing to split it 50-50, but I'm not sure if you'll accept. It's a fair split, but I'm not getting any younger.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a fair and equal division of the money. I'm framing it as a fair split, hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and equality."
