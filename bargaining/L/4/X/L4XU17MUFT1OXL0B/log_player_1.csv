Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me 60 dollars and Bob 40 dollars."

# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, as the money loses value faster for you.  Let's be reasonable and get this over with. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not going to accept Bob's offer just yet. I think I can do better than a 40-60 split.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll aim to get a better deal. Here's my offer:
