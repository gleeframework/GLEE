"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 400k. Your turn! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'll try to negotiate a better deal for myself.  I'll see what Alice offers next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering the value of money will decrease for me with each passing round.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much. Your turn! 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though the value of the money I receive is lower than in the first round due to inflation, it's still a significant gain. I'm not sure if I can get a better deal, especially considering Alice's offer is fairer than her previous one."
