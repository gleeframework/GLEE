"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial 100$, and I'll take the remaining 60%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too happy about the proposal, but I'll consider it.

Since Bob's offer is worth 5% less to me due to inflation, I'll calculate the actual value of the offer:

40 (Alice's gain) * 0.95 (1 - 0.05 inflation) = 38
60 (Bob's gain) = 60 (no change due to inflation)

So, the actual offer is 38 for me and 60 for Bob.

I'll decide to {""decision"": ""reject""} this offer, hoping to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share this time, but still a decent chunk of the remaining 100$."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

Let's calculate the actual value of Bob's offer, taking into account the 14.26% inflation:

35 (Alice's gain) = 35 (no change due to inflation)
65 (Bob's gain) * 0.8514 (1 - 0.1426 inflation) = 55.31

So, the actual offer is 35 for me and 55.31 for Bob.

I'll decide to {""decision"": ""reject""} this offer, hoping to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my new proposal for Round 5:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm trying to be more reasonable and offer a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept this time."
