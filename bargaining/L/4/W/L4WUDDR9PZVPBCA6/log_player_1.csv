"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small amount, hoping he'll take it and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A decent offer, but I'm holding out for more! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the decreasing value of money due to inflation, I'll have to be more cautious with my decision.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, so I'll aim for a higher share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob! The value of money is slipping away!""
}
```

I'm making a slightly more aggressive offer, hoping Bob will accept it before the value of the money drops further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle, it's a fair deal! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is taking a toll! The value of the money is decreasing rapidly.

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a decent compromise, especially since the value of the money is dropping significantly. Splitting it down the middle might not be the most optimal outcome for me, but it's a fair deal given the circumstances.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer and call it a day."
