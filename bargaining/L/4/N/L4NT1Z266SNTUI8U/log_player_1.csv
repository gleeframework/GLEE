"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 
 
I propose a 90/10 split, with me receiving $900,000 and Bob receiving $100,000. This is a fair starting point considering the inflation factor will impact me more in the later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
``` 

I propose a 60/40 split, with me receiving $600,000 and Bob receiving $400,000. This is a counter-offer to Bob's previous proposal, and I believe it's a fairer split considering the inflation factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}

I propose a 70/30 split, with me receiving $700,000 and Bob receiving $300,000. This is a counter-offer to Bob's previous proposal, and I believe it's a fairer split considering the inflation factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I propose an 80/20 split, with me receiving $800,000 and Bob receiving $200,000.  This is a counter-offer to Bob's previous proposal. While I'm losing more due to inflation, I'm trying to find a compromise to avoid reaching the end with nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While this is a significantly smaller share than I initially hoped for, it's better than getting nothing at all. With each round, the inflation is drastically reducing the value of my share, making it a losing proposition to continue rejecting offers."
