"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'm willing to compromise""
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the original $100, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the decreased value of money due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my thinking.

Considering Bob's offer, I'd rather get a bit more than 60%, but I'm not sure if 70% is enough. I'll think for a moment...

I decide to reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the further decrease in the value of money, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while""
}
```

This way, I'm trying to get a bit more than Bob's previous offer, but still leave some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting desperate, but I'm still holding out for a better deal 
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking its toll!

Considering the significant decrease in the value of money, I'm starting to feel the pinch. However, Bob's offer is still a significant compromise, and I don't want to risk going into further rounds.

I'll accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
