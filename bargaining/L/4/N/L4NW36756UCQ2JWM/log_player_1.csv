"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this and we can split the remaining $100,000 in a separate game if you want""
}
```

This offer gives me a significant majority of the money, but still leaves Bob with a decent amount. The message is an attempt to entice Bob to accept the offer and potentially set up a rematch for the remaining $100,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 50/50 split on this round. Let's aim for fairness. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","A 50/50 split is a fair offer, but I'm not sure I'm ready to give up my chance at a larger share just yet. I'll reject this offer and try to do better next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, I'm not getting any younger""
}
```

This offer still gives Bob a decent amount, but I'm trying to maximize my own gain. The message is a bit more assertive, hoping to put pressure on Bob to accept."
