"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
```

This is my first offer, aiming for a large share.  I'm taking into account the potential for inflation but also want to secure a good amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation risk is significant. Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me a sizable sum, which is better than risking getting nothing in later rounds."
