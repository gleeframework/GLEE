Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to offer Bob a small share, hoping he'll accept it in the first round.  I know the money will be worth less in the next rounds, so I want to secure as much as possible right away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more, the inflation is significant, and accepting Bob's offer guarantees me at least half the money (even though it's worth less due to inflation).  It's a better deal than risking a smaller amount in the next round."
