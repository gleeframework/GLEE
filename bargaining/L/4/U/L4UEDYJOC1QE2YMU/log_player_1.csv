"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, it's a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $1,000,000 equally, with each of us getting $500,000. This is a straightforward and simple proposal, and I hope Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking a bit more this time, but it's still a good deal for both of us. Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too thrilled about Bob taking a larger share, but I'm willing to consider it. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll think about it...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer!

{""alice_gain"": 420000, ""bob_gain"": 580000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of!""}

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share than before, but still keeping a decent amount for myself. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
