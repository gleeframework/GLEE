"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the lead, let's see if you'll accept 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money has decreased by 20%!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have 40 dollars, which is worth 80% of the original amount, and Bob will have 60 dollars, which is worth 120% of the original amount, due to the increased value of his share.

I'm not comfortable with this offer, as it seems unfair. I'd like to make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll make a counteroffer""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 30,
  ""bob_gain"": 70,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bigger share, but I need some too""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a larger share, but I'm still hoping to get a decent amount myself. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, you can't refuse 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money has decreased significantly due to inflation!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have 20 dollars, which is worth only 40% of the original amount, and Bob will have 80 dollars, which is worth 160% of the original amount.

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'm starting to feel the pressure. I don't want to give up too much more. I'll accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
