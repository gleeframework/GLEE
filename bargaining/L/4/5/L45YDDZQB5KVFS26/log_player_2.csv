"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's start with a reasonable offer. I propose I take $60 and you take $40. This gives us both something and avoids us potentially losing money due to inflation.

# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want to meet closer to the middle, but the value of the money decreases faster for me. My offer is still the most fair considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60
