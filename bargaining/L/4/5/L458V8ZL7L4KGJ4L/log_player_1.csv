"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

I'm offering Bob $1,000, and I'll take the remaining $9,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $5,000 is now worth 95% of $9,000, which is $8,550. Bob's gain of $5,000 is still worth $5,000.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
