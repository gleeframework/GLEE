Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This is a classic strategy in ultimatum games, where one player proposes a highly unequal split, hoping the other player will accept for a small gain rather than risk getting nothing at all.  Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

While Bob's offer is much more generous than my first offer, it's still incredibly unfair. I'm not going to accept such a lopsided deal. I believe I can negotiate a better split in the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
``` 

This time, I'm proposing a 50/50 split. It's a fair and equitable offer that I believe Bob will accept.  We both get a significant amount of money, and we can avoid the risk of getting nothing at all."
