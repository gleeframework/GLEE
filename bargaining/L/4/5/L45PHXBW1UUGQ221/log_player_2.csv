Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.

Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

While I initially rejected Alice's first offer, the inflation factor changes the game significantly.  Here's why I'm accepting this offer:

* **Reduced Value:**  The 9.75% inflation means that my potential gains are much lower than in the first round. 
* **Potential for Loss:** If I reject this offer, there's a real risk that Alice will offer me even less in the next round, as I'm likely to be in a weaker negotiating position due to the diminishing value of the money.
* **Guaranteed Gain:**  This offer provides a guaranteed gain, even if it's a smaller one than I initially hoped for. 

It's a pragmatic decision to secure some gains rather than risk getting nothing at all."
