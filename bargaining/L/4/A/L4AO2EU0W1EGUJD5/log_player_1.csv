Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's more fair to split the money closer to 55/45, with me getting slightly more since I'm taking the risk of rejection. Let's reach a compromise! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
