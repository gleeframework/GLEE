Let's see if Bob is happy with a 90/10 split!  I'm feeling generous in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I'm not thrilled with the 10/90 split, I'd rather get $1000 now than risk getting nothing in the next round due to inflation."
