,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"Let's split the money 55/45. Since the money loses value over time, I believe it's better for both of us to agree on a division as soon as possible.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"Bob, time is ticking and the money is losing value. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor this time. It's a compromise considering my previous offer.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
48.0,52.0,"Considering the money's devaluation, I'm willing to make a slight concession. A 52/48 split seems reasonable at this point, as we both need to find a middle ground to secure our gains.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
50.0,50.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  The constant haggling is only hurting both of us.  Let's just split it 50/50 and call it a day.",Alice,5,
