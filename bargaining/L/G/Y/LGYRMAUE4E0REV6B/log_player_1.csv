Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn! Let's be realistic. This offer gives me a slight edge, considering the money loses value over time. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
