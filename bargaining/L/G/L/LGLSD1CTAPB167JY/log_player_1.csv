"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $45, which is a reasonable amount, and I'll take $55. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair offer and accept it, considering we're in the first round and the money is still worth its full value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. No need to complicate things. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nWhile Bob's offer to split the money evenly might seem fair at first glance, I have to consider the impact of inflation on my gain. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less in this round, accepting this offer would mean I'm actually getting less than half of the original value. I'm hoping that by rejecting this offer, I can negotiate a better deal in the next round or get Bob to concede more in a future round, despite the decreasing value of the money for me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll offer Bob a bit more than I did in the first round to try to entice him to accept, considering the inflation is starting to affect my gain more noticeably. I'll also adjust my message to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and the urgency of the situation, given the limited number of rounds we have.

{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's find a middle ground that benefits us both before it's too late""}\n\nI'm hoping that by offering Bob $48 and taking $52 for myself, Bob will see this as a more reasonable offer, especially since I'm framing it as a compromise that considers the impact of inflation on my end. I want to emphasize the urgency of reaching an agreement before the value of the money decreases further for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slight edge, but I think a fair split is still possible. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the increasing impact of inflation on my gain, Bob's offer of $49 for me and $51 for him starts to look more appealing, especially since he's now offering me less than I offered him in the previous round, but still more than the even split from round 2. However, I must weigh the fact that accepting this offer means I'd be getting significantly less value than if we had agreed in the first round due to the accumulated inflation effect. Yet, the risk of continuing and possibly ending up with nothing if we don't reach an agreement within the 12 rounds is a significant concern. Given the current state of the game and the decreasing value of the money for me, I will accept Bob's offer to secure a gain, even though it's less than what I initially hoped for.\n{""decision"": ""accept""}"
