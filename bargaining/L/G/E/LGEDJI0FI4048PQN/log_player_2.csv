"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money 60/40. It's a fair deal for a first offer considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's a good starting point, but I think I can get a better deal.  Let's see what Alice proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a 60/40 split, but I think this is a fair compromise considering the inflation that will affect us both.  Let's get this done."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate the offer, but it's not in my best interest.  I propose a 55/45 split. This feels like a fair compromise considering the time constraint and inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'm willing to accept this offer. While I'd prefer a more even split, the time pressure and the potential for further inflation make this a reasonable compromise."
