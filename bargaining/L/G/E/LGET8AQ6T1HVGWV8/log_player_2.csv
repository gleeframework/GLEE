Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a tough decision, but leaning towards accepting is the less risky strategy here.

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:** The longer the game goes on, the less favorable the outcome for Bob.  
* **Alice's Compromise:** While not a huge shift, Alice has moved slightly in Bob's favor, acknowledging the impact of inflation.
* **Future Uncertainty:** There's no guarantee Alice will offer anything better in future rounds. She might even offer less.

**Risks:**

* Accepting means Bob gets slightly less than half the original amount. 

**Overall:**  While not ideal, accepting now minimizes potential losses from further inflation."
