Let's start with a fair split.  50 dollars for each of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'll offer Bob 40 and keep 60 for myself.  Since he rejected my fair offer, I'll take a little more this time.  Let's see if he'll be more reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
Bob is getting greedy. I'm not going to settle for 30 when I could get more!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm raising my offer slightly, hoping Bob will realize he needs to be more reasonable.  He's been rejecting fair offers, so I'm not going to let him take advantage of me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being unreasonable.  I'm not going to settle for such a small share, especially with inflation eating away at the value of the money!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm going to go all in and propose a very unbalanced offer.  Bob has been rejecting everything, so maybe this will make him realize he needs to negotiate.  It's a risky move, but I'm not going to let him win!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is becoming increasingly unreasonable. I won't settle for such a small share, especially with inflation making the money worth so much less. I'm going to keep fighting for a fairer share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

This is my final stand.  I'm going to propose a very uneven split, hoping Bob will realize he has to give in.  I'm not going to settle for crumbs, and with only a few rounds left, I'm going to risk it all!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 86.58% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is simply unacceptable. It's clear he's only interested in maximizing his own gains, even at the expense of a fair outcome.  I'm not going to give in to his greed, even though the money is worth very little now. I'll continue to fight for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5}
```

I'm doubling down on my last offer. Bob is clearly being unreasonable, so I'm going to push my luck one more time. If he rejects this, we both get nothing, and that's a risk I'm willing to take."
