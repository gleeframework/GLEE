# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n###\nI'll reject this offer again, hoping that in the next round, Alice might be more willing to compromise due to the increasing impact of inflation on both our potential gains.\n###\n\n###"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a compromise. I understand the inflation is hitting you harder, but I need a decent share too. It's time to settle. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n###\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on my potential gain, Alice's offer seems more reasonable at this point. Further rounds would only diminish the value of the money further, so it's prudent to accept this compromise.\n###\n\n###"
