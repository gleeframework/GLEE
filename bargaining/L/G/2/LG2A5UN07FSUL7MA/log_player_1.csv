"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This way, I'll get 80% of the initial amount, and Bob will get 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to adjust my strategy.

I reject Bob's offer. I'd rather wait for a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my revised offer, taking into account the 20% inflation from the previous round:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6400,
  ""bob_gain"": 3600
}
```

This way, I'll get 64% of the current value, and Bob will get 36%."
