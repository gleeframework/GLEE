"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

This offer gives me a significant advantage, but it's also reasonable enough that Bob might accept it in the first round.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly less favorable to me than my initial offer, and I know that the inflation will only continue to work against him. I'm confident that I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm reducing my offer slightly, but I'm still keeping the majority of the money.  Bob is likely feeling the pressure of inflation now, and I want to see if he's willing to compromise."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still keeping the majority of the money. The inflation is starting to impact Bob significantly, and he's likely feeling the pressure to accept a deal soon.  I'm pushing my advantage but keeping it reasonable in case he wants to counter."
