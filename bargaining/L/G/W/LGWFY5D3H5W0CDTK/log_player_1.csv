"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take a slightly larger share to account for my initiative in proposing the split.""}

I'm proposing that I receive 80% of the initial $10,000, which is $8,000, and Bob receives the remaining 20%, which is $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair split is fair, no need to overthink it! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not convinced that a 50/50 split is the best option, considering the initiative I took in proposing the first offer. However, I don't want to risk losing more value due to inflation. I'll accept Bob's offer for now.
