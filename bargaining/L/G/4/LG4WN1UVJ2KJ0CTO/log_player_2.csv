Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my share should be higher. This is a more reasonable offer.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said 50/50 was your final offer, but I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle. This is as low as I'll go. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The longer the game continues, the more I lose due to inflation. While Alice's offer isn't ideal, it's better to accept a less-than-ideal offer than risk getting even less in future rounds. 

Here's why:

* **Time Value of Money:**  Every round I wait, the potential money I receive is worth less. 
* **Alice's Position:** She seems firm in her desire for a larger share and is unlikely to agree to a 50/50 split.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Rejecting this offer risks getting an even lower amount later, which would be a worse outcome than accepting the current offer."
