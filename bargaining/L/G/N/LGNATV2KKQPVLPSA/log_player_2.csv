Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're eager to get a bigger share, but I still think I can offer a better deal for both of us. Consider the inflation, and let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is trying to take advantage of my higher inflation rate, but I need to hold out for a better deal.  The offer is slowly getting better, but it's still not fair."

# Alice gain: 550000

This is getting close, but I need to hold out for a bit longer. Alice knows the pressure is on me, but she's also feeling the heat."
