"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```
I'm proposing that I get $80 and Bob gets $20. This is a relatively fair split, and it's a good starting point for the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I'll have to think carefully about this offer. However, a 50/50 split is a reasonable proposal, and it's a good opportunity to get a fair share of the remaining money. I'll accept this offer.
