"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5, ""message"": ""Let's start fair. I'll take 95, you get 5.  We can negotiate further if you want.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more than your initial offer, but I'm not giving away too much yet. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 60/40. I'm starting to feel the effects of inflation, so we need to find a deal quickly.""}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to give up more than 55, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I would prefer a higher percentage, given the inflation and the fact that Bob is unlikely to budge much further, accepting this offer is the best option to avoid getting even less in the next round."
