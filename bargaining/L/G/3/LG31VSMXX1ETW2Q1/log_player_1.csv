"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, seems fair to me.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a generous offer considering I'm the one making the first move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 80% of what it was in the first round.

Considering the reduced value of the money, I think Bob's offer is quite generous. I'll accept his proposal.
