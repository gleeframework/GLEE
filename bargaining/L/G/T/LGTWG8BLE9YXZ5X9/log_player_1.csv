"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, hoping to set a good tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take more! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of me. Since the money is worth 20% less now, I'll need to adjust my strategy.

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not so fast! I'll give you 450000, but I want 550000""
}
```

I'm trying to maintain a balance and take a slightly larger share, considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth 40% less than in the first round. I'll need to be more aggressive in my proposal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, I'm not going to give you more!""
}
```

I'm taking a slightly more assertive tone, offering a 70/30 split in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, I'll meet you in the middle this time 
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to find a middle ground. Considering the significant reduction in the value of the money due to inflation, I'll think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, let's meet in the middle. I'll take it.""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer, as it seems like a reasonable compromise given the circumstances."
