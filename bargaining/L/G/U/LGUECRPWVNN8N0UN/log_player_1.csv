"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

This way, I get the majority of the money, but still give Bob a decent share. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain is now worth even less, so I need to be more careful. Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, which is a reasonable compromise. I'll accept this offer.
