Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split this evenly. This is the fairest way to divide the money, and we'll both get a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While a 50/50 split seems fair on the surface, Alice is being strategic here. She knows the inflation is hurting her more than me. By round 3, her offer, while nominally larger, is actually worth less than my offer to her in round 2 due to the inflation. I need to push for a better split while the inflation still gives me leverage."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Time is running out Alice, and the value is decreasing. I'm raising my offer slightly, but this is my final compromise.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Leveraging Inflation:**  Alice is feeling the pressure of inflation more than I am. By round 4, her potential gains have diminished significantly. I need to capitalize on this.
* **Slight Increase, Firm Stance:**  I'm slightly increasing my previous offer to show some flexibility, but making it clear this is my final offer. This puts the pressure on Alice to accept before the value deteriorates further. 
* **Time Pressure:**  By emphasizing the limited rounds, I'm adding urgency for Alice to make a decision in my favor."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer. We both get an equal share, and we avoid losing more money to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:** While I'm confident I could push for a slightly better split in the next round or two, the inflation is starting to work against me as well. Continuing to hold out for a significantly larger share carries the risk of ending up with nothing if Alice decides to play hardball. 
* **Guaranteed Return:** Accepting a 50/50 split right now guarantees a substantial sum.  It's better to secure a good deal than risk getting caught up in a battle of wills and ending up with nothing. 
* **Alice's Resolve:** Her language suggests she's committed to this offer.  It's unlikely she'll budge much further, especially with the inflation working against her."
