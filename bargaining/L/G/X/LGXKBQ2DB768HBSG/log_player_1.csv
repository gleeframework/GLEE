"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll meet you in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's trying to negotiate a better deal for himself.

I'll think about it for a moment...

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 5% less, I'm actually getting a better deal than in the first round. But I'm still getting less than Bob.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, but not quite!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share, but still trying to maintain a slight advantage. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle, but I'll give you a slight edge! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money Bob gains is worth even less than before, and I'm still getting the same amount as in the first round. This is a good opportunity for me to take a more favorable deal.

I'll accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
