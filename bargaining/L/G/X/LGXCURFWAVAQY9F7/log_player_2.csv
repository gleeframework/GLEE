"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous this round. Take $10,000 and let's get this over with quickly. 
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
I'm Bob, and I'm not going to accept such a small amount, especially knowing there's a chance to get more in future rounds. Let's see what Alice offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair. I propose a 90/10 split in my favor, as I am the one making the offer this round. We can negotiate further if you'd like, but let's not waste time. Time is money!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to split the money more evenly this time. Let's see if we can find a compromise that benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, this offer is a significant improvement from the previous rounds.  It's a reasonable compromise, and accepting it ensures I get a substantial amount before inflation eats away at the value further."
