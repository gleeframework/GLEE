"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose taking 90 dollars and giving Bob 10 dollars.  This gives me the majority of the money, but it's a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer is the best strategy.  The inflation means my potential gains in future rounds are significantly diminished, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer from Bob.  It's better to take the 40 dollars now."
