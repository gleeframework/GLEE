"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can move on.""
}

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth 10% less for Bob, his offer is actually a 50% share of the remaining value, which is equivalent to a 55.56% share of the original $1,000,000. That's a pretty aggressive offer, considering I was initially offered a 40% share in the first round.

I'll reject this offer and wait for the next round.
