"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, Bob. This accounts for the inflation we'll both face. 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This seems like a fair offer on the surface, but it doesn't fully account for the fact that I'm the one experiencing inflation, not Alice. I need to aim for a slightly better deal to offset the losses from each round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's keep it simple and split it evenly. A fair deal for both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm aiming for a fair deal, Bob. This offer keeps the inflation in mind. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is slightly better than her initial offer, but it's still not enough to offset the inflation I'm facing. I need to hold out for a more significant share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Okay Alice, let's meet in the middle. This factors in the inflation impact a bit more.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Time is running out, Bob.  This offer is a good compromise considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4900 
# Alice gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is cutting it close, but given the time pressure and the fact that her offer is closer to my previous one, I'll accept to avoid the risk of getting nothing."
