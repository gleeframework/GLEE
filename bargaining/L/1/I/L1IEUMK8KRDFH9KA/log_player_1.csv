Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the inflation disparity, but your initial offer was too low. This is a more balanced proposal. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting dangerously close to losing a significant chunk of this money. I'm holding firm at 40 to reflect the inflation difference, but this offer won't be on the table much longer. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 

Bob is unlikely to go much lower, and the longer we wait the less we both get. Accepting now secures a reasonable amount before inflation eats away at it further."
