"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but still a bit more for me 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, my gain of 4000 is now equivalent to 3200 in real value.

I'll have to think about it... Considering Bob's offer is still slightly biased towards him, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60/40 in his favor, I'll try to counter with a slightly more favorable offer for myself. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to be generous!""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, my gain of 3000 is now equivalent to approximately 1600 in real value.

I'm not thrilled with this offer, but I'll have to consider it. Since Bob is still getting a larger share, I'll think carefully before making a decision.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 70/30 in his favor, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal. Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3600,
  ""bob_gain"": 6400,
  ""message"": ""I'm not giving up, let's try to find a better middle ground!""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
