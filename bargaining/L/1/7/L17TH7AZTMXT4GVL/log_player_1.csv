"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering you $400,000, and I'll take $600,000. It's a 60-40 split, which I think is a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to trick me into accepting his original offer, but with a slight twist.

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my calculation.

My gain of $400,000 is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $320,000.
Your gain of $600,000 is now worth 95% of its original value, which is $570,000.

I'll reject this offer, as I'd like to negotiate further.

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm offering you $450,000, and I'll take $550,000."
