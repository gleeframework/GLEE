# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting increasingly aggressive, aiming for a larger share while using the pressure of inflation.  While the offer isn't terrible, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal in the next few rounds. My offers are reasonable, and Alice will feel the pressure soon."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is it. We're down to the wire.  Take this deal â€“ you'll still get a significant amount, and we both avoid losing everything. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** This is a tough one, but time pressure is immense. Accepting guarantees a payout, even if far from ideal. Rejecting at this stage is very risky. Alice knows I'm feeling the pressure, and her next offer might be even worse."
