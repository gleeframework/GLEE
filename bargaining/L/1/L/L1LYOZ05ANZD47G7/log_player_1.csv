# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

""decision"": ""reject""

Let's see if we can get a better deal in the next round. Bob is undervaluing the impact of inflation on his side."

# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob is still heavily favoring himself in this deal, even with the increasing impact of inflation.  I need to hold firm and emphasize the shrinking pot."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  My offer is more than fair, and it's the last one I'm making above 50%. Take it before we both lose out! 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

Bob is getting desperate, but I need to hold strong. His offer is still heavily skewed in his favor, even considering the inflation.  He's bluffing about staying above 50%; he loses much faster than I do as time runs out."
