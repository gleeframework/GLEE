"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! Take the low offer and we can move on.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping to get a better deal in future rounds due to the looming inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Not bad, but I can do better than that. Your turn to think! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Considering that my gain is worth 20% less this round, I'd like to get a better deal. However, Bob's offer is a significant improvement over my initial proposal, and I don't want to risk going lower.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now.
