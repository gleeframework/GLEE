"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I'll take the majority and you get a small share. This is just the beginning, so let's see how it goes. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
It's better to start with a negotiation rather than accepting a small share right away. There are still 11 rounds to go, and the money will lose value for Bob with each round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split the money evenly. We both get a fair share, and we don't have to worry about the inflation eating away at our gains.""}
