I propose to keep $9,000 and give Bob $1,000. I'm taking a big chunk, but I figure I have the upper hand in this game.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. Even though it's worth 5% less due to inflation, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'm willing to risk another round to try and negotiate a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm lowering my demands slightly, but I still think a 60/40 split is fair, considering the inflation.  Let's see if Bob is more willing to compromise this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer.  Even though the inflation is hitting harder, I'm confident I can get a better deal. I'm not going to give in to his pressure this early. I'll take my chances with another round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

Inflation is really taking a bite out of the money now, so I'm going for a 50/50 split.  I think it's fair to meet him in the middle, and hopefully, he'll finally accept.  I'm not sure how much longer I can keep rejecting his offers!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Okay, I'll accept Bob's offer. Inflation is really starting to hurt, and I'm worried that if I keep rejecting, I'll end up with even less.  It's not the ideal outcome, but at least I'm getting something."
