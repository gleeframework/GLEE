"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a small share to get us started.""
}
```

I'm offering to give Bob a relatively small amount to start, while keeping the majority of the money for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is fair. Let's keep it simple. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gains are still worth 8000, but Bob's gains are worth 1800 (10% less than 2000).

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll decide to reject it. I'd like to keep more than 50% of the money, considering the inflation effect. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly higher share than in the previous round, but still keeping the majority of the money for myself."
