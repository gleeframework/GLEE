Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not budging much, but I'm willing to give you a tiny share to end this soon.

# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm accepting this offer. Even though the inflation is hitting me hard, it's better to secure a small gain than risk getting nothing at all in further rounds."
