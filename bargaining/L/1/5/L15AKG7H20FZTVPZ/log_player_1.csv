  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 5% less, so I'll have to adjust my expectations. Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a bit too skewed in his favor. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```

  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""Compromise at 42/58, let's meet in the middle""

# Bob gain: 6000
