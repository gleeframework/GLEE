"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor. I figure I can secure a good portion of the money this early on, and I don't want to risk losing more with inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being more reasonable, but I'm still in a good position to gain more. I'll reject and try for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
``` 

I'll offer a 7000/3000 split.  This should be a good compromise that still benefits me but is more generous than my previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though the money is worth less for both of us, this offer is a good deal for me.  I've lost a significant amount due to inflation, and with a few more rounds, things could get even worse. I'm going to accept this offer before I lose more."
