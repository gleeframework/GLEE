"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 90% and you can have 10%""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small amount to see if he'll accept and end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll consider the effective amount I'll receive in this round.

My gain of $500,000 is worth 80% of its original value due to inflation, so I'll actually receive $400,000 in this round.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
