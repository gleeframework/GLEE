"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects the urgency for you to settle due to the higher inflation you face. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While Alice's offer seems fair on the surface, it's crucial to consider the inflation rates. With each round, my potential gains are significantly reduced, making it unwise to accept such a small portion so early on. I'll risk rejecting this offer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split this evenly, Alice.  While I'm facing higher inflation, we both lose more with each passing round.  This is a fair and quick solution for us both.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate the sentiment of a 50/50 split, but the devaluation rate puts you at a greater disadvantage.  I'm willing to adjust my initial offer to reflect this. Let's be sensible and close this deal. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation rate is working against me heavily. This offer from Alice is significantly better than what I would get if we were to keep rejecting each other. The risk of getting nothing at all is too high at this point, so I'll accept this deal."
