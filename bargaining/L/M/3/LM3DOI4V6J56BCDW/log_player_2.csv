Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is ticking and the value decreases. I'm proposing a slightly better deal for me than last time. Let's seal this before it's too late. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""alice_gain"": 4900,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but the clock is ticking. This is a reasonable offer considering the declining value. Let's agree and get something! 
# Bob gain: 4850 
# Alice gain: 5150 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is steadily decreasing her offer amount, taking advantage of the inflation working against me. While the pressure is on, accepting a deal where I consistently get less than a fair share is a losing strategy.  I need to push for a better split in the next round or two."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Alice, the inflation is working against me. This is a compromise to settle before things get worse for both of us.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Time is becoming a factor, and I need to start pushing back harder. This offer is still generous to Alice, but it's the first where I receive more than half the money.  It reflects the urgency of the situation while attempting to secure a reasonable deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. We're both losing out. I'm making a small concession -  take it before the deal gets even worse! 
# Bob gain: 4900 
# Alice gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision, but with the inflation eating away at my potential gains, I need to be realistic. Alice is unlikely to offer a better deal at this stage, and holding out for a slightly larger share comes with the risk of getting nothing at all if we fail to agree. Accepting this offer secures me a reasonable sum considering the circumstances."
