"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think 2:1 is a fair ratio considering the value of money is decreasing. Let's take the first step towards a compromise. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
