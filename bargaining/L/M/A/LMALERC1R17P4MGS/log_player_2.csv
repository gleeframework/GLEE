"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take the lion's share, but I'm willing to let you have a small piece. Let's get this over with. 
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Even though I only get a small piece, it's better to see what Alice's next offer will be. I might get a slightly better deal in the next round, and the money is worth less to me with each passing round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly. I'll take a bit less now, but I'm hoping we can both get a decent share and avoid further losses from inflation.""}
