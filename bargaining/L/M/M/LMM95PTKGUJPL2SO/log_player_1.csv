"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. I'm not comfortable with such a large imbalance, and with inflation, it's best to secure a fair share now. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{
