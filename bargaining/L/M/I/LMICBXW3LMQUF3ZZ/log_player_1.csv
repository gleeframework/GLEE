"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60, you take 40. No need to negotiate.""
}
```

This is a relatively equal split, so I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle. I'll take 50, you take 50. It's a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round, I need to adjust my valuation of the offer.

In the first round, Bob's offer of 40 was equivalent to 40 dollars. Now, since the money is worth 20% less, Bob's offer of 50 is equivalent to 40 dollars in the first round's value.

Considering this, Bob's offer is actually a reduction from his previous offer, so I'll try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this compromise. I'll wait for a better offer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's now my turn again. I'll try to make a more attractive offer to Bob. Considering that the money is worth 40% less than in the first round (20% less than the previous round), I'll aim for a slightly higher share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more. 55 for me, 45 for you. It's a good compromise, don't you think?""
}
```

This offer is a bit more generous than my initial offer, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a smaller share this time. I think 30 is a good compromise. You can have 70. It's getting harder to make ends meet with the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I need to adjust my valuation of the offer.

In the first round, Bob's offer of 40 was equivalent to 40 dollars. Now, since the money is worth 48.8% less, Bob's offer of 30 is equivalent to approximately 20.71 dollars in the first round's value.

Considering this, Bob's offer is actually a significant reduction from his previous offers, and I'm starting to think that he's getting desperate due to the inflation. I'll try to take advantage of this.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure you're in a strong position, Bob. I'll try to get an even better deal.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was quite weak, I'll try to make a stronger move. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for an even higher share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""I'm feeling confident now. I'll take 80, you can have 20. It's getting clear that I'm in the driver's seat.""
}
```

This offer is quite aggressive, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it to avoid further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting desperate, but I'll give you 90. I just want to hold on to something. Please, Alice, don't crush me completely. 
# Alice gain: 90 
# Bob gain: 10 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on Bob's offers, isn't it? Considering the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round, I need to adjust my valuation of the offer.

In the first round, Bob's offer of 40 was equivalent to 40 dollars. Now, since the money is worth 67.23% less, Bob's offer of 10 is equivalent to approximately 12.86 dollars in the first round's value.

Given that Bob's previous offer was 20, and now he's offering 10, it's clear that he's getting extremely desperate. I'll try to take advantage of this and get as much as I can.

However, I also don't want to completely crush Bob, as he seems to be getting anxious. I'll make a counteroffer that's still quite generous, but not as extreme as my previous offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not going to be cruel, Bob. But I'm not going to be generous either. I'll counter with 85 for me, 15 for you. It's a fair deal, considering the circumstances.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'm going to make a strong move now. Since Bob's offers have been getting progressively weaker, I'll aim for an even higher share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 95,
  ""bob_gain"": 5,
  ""message"": ""I've had enough of your games, Bob. I'm taking what's mine. 95 for me, 5 for you. It's time to end this.""
}
```

This offer is extremely aggressive, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it to avoid further negotiations."
