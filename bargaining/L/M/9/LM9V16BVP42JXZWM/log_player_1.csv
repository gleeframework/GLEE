"Round 1

This is a fair offer for the first round.  I'm offering Bob a smaller amount, knowing that the money will be worth less to him in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

This offer is worse than the previous one. It's better to see if I can get a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I'm increasing my share slightly, but still offering Bob a share.  Inflation is starting to bite for him, and he'll likely be motivated to accept a deal that gives him a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

I am still rejecting this offer. Even with inflation, Bob's offer is not fair. I'm still hoping for a better deal, and I'm aware that inflation is hurting him more than me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but I'm still offering Bob a sizable portion. Inflation is hitting him hard, and I think he might be willing to accept this to avoid getting nothing in the later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

I'll accept this offer. Even with inflation, this is a decent outcome, and it's a fair split for both of us. It's getting risky to keep rejecting offers, and we are both getting hurt by inflation."
