Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit more. Let's go with a 55/45 split in my favor. It's a fair middle ground, and we can avoid losing even more money with each passing round. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, time is becoming a significant factor. Accepting now would mean a significant loss compared to the initial rounds. It's worth risking another counter-offer to see if we can secure a better deal before inflation eats away too much of our potential gain."
