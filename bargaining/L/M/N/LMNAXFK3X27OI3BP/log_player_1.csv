# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offers are slowly increasing, but they're not increasing fast enough.  It's still beneficial for me to hold out for a better offer. The inflation working against him gives me leverage."

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer.  Let's close this deal and both walk away with something. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The game is reaching a critical point. While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer guarantees a significant gain.  Rejecting it carries the risk of getting even less as time pressure increases, and we risk getting nothing at all if we don't reach an agreement."
