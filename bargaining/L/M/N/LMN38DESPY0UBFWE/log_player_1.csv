"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start with. A fair and simple beginning.""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $5,000. This is a reasonable starting point, and it gives us a chance to assess the game and adjust our strategy later on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You got aggressive, now it's my turn to be cautious. I'm offering you a smaller share, but it's still a decent start. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled with the offer, but I'll consider it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better. I'm willing to take a risk and try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

I'm increasing my offer to $4,000 for myself and $6,000 for Bob, hoping that Bob will be willing to take a slightly bigger risk and accept this deal."
