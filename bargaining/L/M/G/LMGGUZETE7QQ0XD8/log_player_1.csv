"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take the majority, but you'll get a decent chunk to start with.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split in my favor, with me taking $8,000 and Bob getting $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly larger share this time, but I'm still not willing to give up too much 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, the effective amounts are:

* My gain: $6,000 / 0.8 = $7,500
* Bob's gain: $4,000 / 0.95 = $4,211.58

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than a 60-40 split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more given the risks and efforts. Meet me in the middle?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor, with me taking $5,500 and Bob getting $4,500."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share given my own contributions 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 48.8% less for me and 14.26% less for Bob, the effective amounts are:

* My gain: $5,000 / 0.5168 = $9,690.32
* Bob's gain: $5,000 / 0.8586 = $5,823.19

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer because we're finally meeting in the middle, and I don't want to risk going into the next round with even less value in the money."
