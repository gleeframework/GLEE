This is getting ridiculous, but I'm still holding strong. Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation, but I need to remain firm. Accepting such a low offer at this stage would set a terrible precedent."

It's painful, but I have to accept.  The inflation is killing me, and it's only going to get worse. If I reject this, I'll likely end up with even less in the subsequent rounds."
