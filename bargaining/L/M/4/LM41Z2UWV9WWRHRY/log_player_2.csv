"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair.  I'll take 60, you take 40.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 20% less in each subsequent round, I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal before the value of the money decreases further."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's try a bit more in my favor, considering the next round will be worth even less.""}\n\nSince the money loses 20% of its value with each round, and we're now in the second round, the total value we're actually negotiating over is $80 (because 100 * 0.8 = 80). However, for simplicity and to stick to the game's apparent rules, I'll frame my offer as if we're still dividing the original $100, aiming for a slightly better deal than Alice's initial offer, considering the decreasing value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's split it down the middle.  We both get $50, and we can be done with this.  Inflation is getting worse, and it's only going to get harder for us both to get a good deal. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll accept this offer. Given the impact of inflation, where the value of money decreases by 20% with each round, and now being in the third round where the money is worth 36% less than initially, accepting a 50/50 split seems reasonable. The actual value we're dividing is significantly less due to inflation, but the principle of the split remains the same. It's better to accept this fair offer now rather than risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nLet's end the game here on a fair note before the value decreases further."
