"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

This seems like a fair starting offer, giving me the majority while still giving Bob something. It leaves room for negotiation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation means my gain is worth less in each round. Accepting this offer guarantees me at least $50, which is better than risking getting nothing in later rounds."
