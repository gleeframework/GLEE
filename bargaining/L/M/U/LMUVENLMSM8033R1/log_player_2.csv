{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering the inflation. It gives you a good share, and it leaves me with a reasonable amount to start with.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. However, the inflation puts me at a real disadvantage. I'm proposing 57/43 -  it's a smaller gap than your offer, and it ensures we both get a decent amount while acknowledging the time pressure. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
