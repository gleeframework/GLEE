"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 70% of the initial $1,000,000 and leave Bob with 30%. I'm starting with a relatively generous offer to see if Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 50/50, no need to negotiate further! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is a straightforward negotiator!

I'll consider his offer, but I'm not ready to settle for a 50/50 split just yet. I'd like to propose a slightly more favorable split for myself.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to propose a 60/40 split in my favor. Let's see if you'll budge, Bob!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 5% less due to inflation, my goal is to get a better deal for myself.

Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more. Will 55/45 work for you, Bob?""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to take 55% of the remaining $950,000 (after the 5% inflation) and leaving Bob with 45%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, but I think 60/40 is a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to squeeze more out of me.

Considering the money is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I need to adjust my expectations. However, I'm not ready to accept a 60/40 split just yet.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with 60/40. I'll propose a 58/42 split in my favor. Let's see if you'll meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 19.56% less than in the first round, I need to be more aggressive in my proposal.

Here's my new offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit desperate, Bob. This is my final offer. Will you meet me at 48/52?""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to take 48% of the remaining $819,200 (after 19.56% inflation) and leaving Bob with 52%. This is my last attempt to get a decent deal before I'm forced to accept a worse offer."
