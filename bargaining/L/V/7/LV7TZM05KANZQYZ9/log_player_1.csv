"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm offering to divide the $10,000 equally between us, with each of us getting $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the unequal split, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll have to think carefully.

After some thought, I've decided to:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll aim to get a better deal this time around. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500}

I'm offering a slightly more unequal split, but still trying to be reasonable given the reduced value of the money."
