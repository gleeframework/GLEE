"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since I rejected the 50/50 split, I'll try to get a better deal. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a higher share.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll think carefully about this offer. Since I rejected the previous offers, I'll try to get a better deal. However, Alice's offer seems reasonable, and I don't want to risk losing even more value in the next round.
