**Reasoning:**

Alice is still clearly trying to take a larger share, even though the value of the money is decreasing rapidly for both of us.  It's getting close to the point where accepting a less favorable offer is better than risking getting nothing if we run out of rounds. However, I think I can still push for a slightly better deal in the next round."
