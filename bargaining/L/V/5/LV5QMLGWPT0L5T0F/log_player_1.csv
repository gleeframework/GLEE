"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the $10,000 and leaving 40% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new offer, Bob is now offering me $4,000, which is worth 90% of the original $4,000, and he's keeping $6,000, which is worth 90% of the original $6,000.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, as it seems like a good deal, but I'd like to negotiate further. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In round 3, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 81% of its original value due to inflation (90% of 90%), I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the decrease in value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

I'm offering to take 70% of the current value of $10,000, which is $7,700, and leaving 30% for Bob, which is $3,300."
