"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, I'm not budging!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself."

# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","A fair offer, but I'm not sure I want to split it evenly. I'd rather take a bigger share. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 0% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll try to take advantage of that. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""You're losing out, Bob, take it or leave it!""
}
```"

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bigger share to make this worthwhile for me. Let's split it 40/60. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","A 40/60 split is still a bit too generous for Bob, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I'd rather have a bigger share. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 0% less for me and 37.1% less for Bob, I'll try to take advantage of that. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""You're running out of time, Bob, take it or leave it!""
}

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a smaller share now to avoid further losses due to inflation. Let's split it 30/70. It's a better deal for both of us than continuing this game. 
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","A 30/70 split is starting to look more appealing, especially considering the effects of inflation. I think I'll take it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
