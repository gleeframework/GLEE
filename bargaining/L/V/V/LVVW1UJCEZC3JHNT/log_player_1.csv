Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take a smaller share this round""}

I'm proposing that I get $40 and Bob gets $60. I'm being generous and giving Bob a larger share to start, hoping he'll accept the offer."
