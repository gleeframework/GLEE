Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, Alice, but it wasn't quite fair. How about this split instead?  Consider that your share is worth less each round we play. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60, ""message"": ""Okay, Bob, I see your point about inflation. Let's try this: I'll take 40, and you take 60.  This way, we both get a decent share and can avoid the continued devaluation of my earnings.""}
