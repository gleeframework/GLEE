**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation is eating profits:**  With each round, the value of the money decreases significantly. Waiting any longer means a smaller prize for both of us, even if we could negotiate a slightly better split.
* **Bob is unlikely to concede much more:** Bob's offer is already a compromise, moving closer to a 50/50 split.  He's likely aware of the inflation factor and won't want to lose more money by dragging this out. 
* **Something is better than nothing:** If I reject this offer, there's a chance Bob might play hardball in the next round, offering an even less favorable split. 

It's better to secure a decent amount now than risk getting a worse deal later and losing more to inflation."
