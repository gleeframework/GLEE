Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair start, let's see if you can do better!""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a relatively fair starting point. Let's see if Bob can come up with a better offer!"

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair - I'm willing to take a slightly larger share this time, but I'm open to negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""You're getting greedy, Bob! I'll give you a slightly better deal this time, but don't think you're getting off that easy!""}

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, trying to find a middle ground that's slightly more favorable to me than Bob's previous offer. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
