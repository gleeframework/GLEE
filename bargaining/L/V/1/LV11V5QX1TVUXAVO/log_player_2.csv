"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I'll take most of it this round, but we can negotiate later. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While Alice's offer is tempting in the first round, it's important to consider the long-term implications. Rejecting allows me to propose in the next round, giving me more control over the negotiation process and potentially a better share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
