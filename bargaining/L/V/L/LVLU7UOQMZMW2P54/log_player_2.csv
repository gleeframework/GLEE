"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer. I believe this split reflects the fact that we both lose money if we wait too long. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""Your offer was tempting, but time is money! Let's close this deal - this offer benefits us both.""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Understanding the urgency:**  The inflation rate heavily favors Bob. Each round significantly diminishes the value of the potential winnings for both players, but especially for Bob. A quick resolution is ideal.
* **Offering a slight improvement:**  While Alice's initial offer wasn't terrible, it leaned in her favor. Bob's counter-offer proposes a more balanced split that still gives Alice a slight advantage, making it more likely she'll accept. 
* **Strong message:** By highlighting the time sensitivity and mutual benefit of his offer, Bob increases the pressure on Alice to accept and avoid further losses due to inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems you overestimate the speed of inflation. I'm willing to compromise, but this has to be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation is taking its toll:**  While Alice's offer is still tilted in her favor, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. Waiting longer will likely result in even worse offers for Bob.
* **Alice is unlikely to budge much:** Her message suggests she's aware of the inflation but is willing to play the long game to some extent. Holding out hope for a significantly better offer in later rounds is risky. 
* **A reasonable compromise:** Given the circumstances, accepting a 44/56 split, while not ideal, secures Bob a decent portion of the money before its value diminishes further."
