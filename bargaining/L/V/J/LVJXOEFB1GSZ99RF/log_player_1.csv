"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you $100,000, it's a fair share!""
}
```

This way, I get 90% of the initial amount, and Bob gets 10%. I'm hoping he'll accept this generous offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take 30% and be happy! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not so generous of Bob, is he?

I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with this offer. I'll wait for a better proposal from Bob!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 850000,
  ""bob_gain"": 150000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you $150,000, but don't expect more!""
}
```

This time, I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share, but still a decent amount. Let's see if he'll accept!"
