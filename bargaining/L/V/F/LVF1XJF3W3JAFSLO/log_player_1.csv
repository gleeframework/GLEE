"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I'm offering you $400,000, and I'll take $600,000. It's a fair split, don't you think?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, I'll consider the actual amounts I'd gain in this round. 

If I accept this offer, I'd get $500,000, which is 80% of the original $600,000 I was offered in the first round. 

I'll accept Bob's offer.
