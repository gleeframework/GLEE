"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's share fairly 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5250, ""alice_gain"": 4750, ""message"": ""My turn.  This accounts for inflation.""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation is Key:** The longer the game goes, the less the money is worth, especially for Alice. It's in Bob's best interest to end the game sooner.
* **Fairness with a Twist:** Alice's initial offer was slightly in her favor. Bob's counter-offer is also slightly in his favor, but crucially, it factors in the inflation losses for both players. This makes the offer more appealing to Alice, as rejecting it means her potential gain diminishes significantly in the next round. 
* **Direct Communication:**  The message is clear and concise, emphasizing that this offer is a more realistic reflection of the game's rules."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, let's meet halfway 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Money:**  The longer this goes on, the less the money is worth to both of us, but especially to Alice. 
* **Favorable Shift:** Alice's offer is now closer to a 50/50 split, acknowledging the impact of inflation. While it's not the 5250 I wanted, getting 4800 now is better than risking further devaluation. 
* **Avoiding a Loss:** If I reject this, there's a chance Alice will lowball me in the next round, and the money will be worth even less. It's better to take a reasonable offer now than gamble on a potentially worse outcome later."
