I'm taking a very aggressive approach in this first round!  I'm assuming Bob is likely to accept a small amount rather than risk getting nothing if we go to another round.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I'd love to continue the game and try to get a better deal, Bob's offer is too good to refuse. A 50/50 split is a fair outcome, and since inflation affects Bob's money more than mine, I'm happy to take this deal and end the game."
