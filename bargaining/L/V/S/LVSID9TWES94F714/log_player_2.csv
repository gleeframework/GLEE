Alice's offer:

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's aim for a 90/10 split. This is still a fair deal, considering the inflation impacting your share. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we need to be realistic.  While I'm willing to concede a bit, a 80/20 split is still fair, considering your decreasing gains. Let's reach an agreement before the time runs out. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the pressure is mounting, accepting 20% now is a terrible deal compared to what we *could* get if Alice starts panicking closer to the deadline. We're being tough to maximize our potential gains.  Alice needs to understand we're serious."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm making a final concession.  Let's split it 75/25.  We're both losing money with each passing round, and I believe this is a fair way to end this. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** 

This is a tough call, as the deadline approaches. However, Alice offering a concession suggests she's feeling the pressure too. Holding out a little longer *could* lead to a much better deal for us, even with inflation."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the only fair way to resolve this. We're both running out of time, and this ensures we both walk away with something substantial.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

The pressure is immense at this stage. We need to be firm but also show a willingness to compromise for a truly fair deal. A 50/50 split sends a clear message: we're serious about getting an equitable share, and we're willing to risk it all for a fair outcome. This offer could be interpreted as both strong and fair, potentially pushing Alice to finally accept."
