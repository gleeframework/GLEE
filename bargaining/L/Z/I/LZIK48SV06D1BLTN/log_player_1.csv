"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do a little better than that. How about this? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### Step 1: Understand the impact of inflation on the value of money in each round.
In each round, the value of the money decreases by 20% due to inflation. This means that the same amount of money is worth less in subsequent rounds.

### Step 2: Consider the previous offers and the decreasing value of money.
In Round 1, Alice offered Bob $45, which he rejected. In Round 2, Bob offered Alice $45, which she rejected as well. Given the decreasing value of money, Alice's initial offer of $55 is now worth less due to inflation.

### Step 3: Calculate the adjusted value of Alice's initial offer considering inflation.
Since the value of money decreases by 20% each round, Alice's initial offer of $55 would be worth $44 in the second round and even less in the third round.

### Step 4: Determine a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of money and the goal of reaching an agreement.
Considering the decreasing value of money and the need to reach an agreement, Alice should make an offer that is more appealing to Bob while still being fair to herself.

### Step 5: Propose a division that reflects the adjusted values and aims for a mutually acceptable agreement.
Alice could propose a division where she receives $50 and Bob receives $50. This offer takes into account the decreasing value of money and aims for a fair and mutually acceptable agreement.

The final answer is: {""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Meet in the middle, considering inflation.""}"
