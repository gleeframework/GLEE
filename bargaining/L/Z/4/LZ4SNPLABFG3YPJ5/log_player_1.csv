Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start, I'll give you a chance to make a better offer next round.""}

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40."

# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share this round, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the inflation.""}

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55/45 is a better split considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm accepting Bob's offer because I think 45/55 is a good compromise considering the inflation. Since my share is worth less due to inflation, I'm willing to accept a smaller share to avoid further rounds and potential worse offers."
