Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my best offer. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

Let's see why this is a good move. Bob's offer is extremely unfair, and waiting might yield a better outcome even with inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 800000,
""bob_gain"": 200000,
""message"": ""I'm willing to negotiate, but this offer is my bottom line. Time is running out for both of us.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** While still favoring Alice, this offer shows a willingness to negotiate from the previous 900,000.
* **Time Pressure:**  The message emphasizes the shrinking pot due to inflation, putting pressure on Bob to accept a less lopsided deal. 
* **Leaving Room for Maneuvering:**  If Bob rejects this offer, there's still space for Alice to make a final, smaller concession in Round 4 if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is fair considering the circumstances. Let's end this. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though the value of the money is decreasing for Alice, accepting Bob's offer at this stage is worse than getting nothing in the final round. 

* **Final Round Calculation:** If Bob maintains this offer in the final round, Alice will gain 300,000 but it'll be worth 30% less due to inflation (a total loss of 90,000).  This leaves Alice with an effective gain of 210,000.
* **Holding Out:** Rejecting forces Bob to make one final offer.  While he might not budge much, there's a chance of getting a slightly better deal than 210,000 (inflation-adjusted). 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  It's a gamble, but the potential loss is small compared to the potential gain of a slightly improved offer from Bob."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""This is my final offer. It's a fair deal considering the time pressure. Let's end this.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Round Pressure:** This is the final round, Bob knows if he rejects this, he gets $0. 
* **Significant Concession:** Alice has dropped significantly from her initial offers, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Appealing to Self-Interest:** The offer, while favoring Alice, still gives Bob a significant sum, making it more likely he'll choose a sure gain over nothing. 

This strategy aims to capitalize on the final round pressure to secure a deal that, while not ideal, still provides Alice with a substantial portion of the initial sum."
