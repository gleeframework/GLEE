"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, considering the initial value of the money.""}

I'm proposing that I receive $6,000 and Bob receives $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  It's the fairest option, and avoids the potential of losing value in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not convinced by Bob's proposal. I think I can do better.

I'm proposing that I receive $5,500 and Bob receives $4,500."
