Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a quick agreement.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is incredibly unfair. While the money I gain is the same, his gain is worth less due to inflation. I'm not going to settle for such a lopsided deal. Let's see if he'll budge in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm reducing my offer slightly, but still keeping it significantly higher than Bob's last offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not desperate to accept his unfair terms."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  He's taking advantage of the fact that the money I gain is worth the same, but his gain is significantly discounted due to inflation.  I'll keep negotiating to get a fairer share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm reducing my offer again, but I'm still holding firm on a significant share for myself. The inflation is starting to hit Bob harder, so I'm hoping he'll start to see the value of a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than the previous rounds, it's still not acceptable. The inflation is hitting him hard, and it's only going to get worse. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't be taken advantage of.  Let's see what he offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm continuing to reduce my offer, but I'm still taking a majority of the money. The inflation is really starting to bite Bob now, and I believe he'll be forced to accept something reasonable soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still not acceptable. While his offer is getting closer, he's still trying to take a larger share even though his money is worth significantly less due to inflation. I'm holding out for a fairer deal.  Let's see if he finally makes a reasonable offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

We're getting close to the end, and the inflation is really starting to hurt Bob.  I'm offering a 50/50 split, which is fair considering the current situation. I'm hoping he'll finally accept."
