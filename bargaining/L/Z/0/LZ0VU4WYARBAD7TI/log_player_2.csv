Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:**  The money is worth less now, but it's not clear how much less for Alice. This makes it risky to keep rejecting.
* **Alice's Offer:** While I'd prefer more, this is a significant improvement on the previous round. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:** By accepting this offer, I can potentially influence Alice's next proposal in future rounds if there are more.

This strategy aims to secure a reasonable share of the money while acknowledging the risk of further inflation and potential for better deals in the future."
