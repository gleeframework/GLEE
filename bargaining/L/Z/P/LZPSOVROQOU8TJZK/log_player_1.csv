Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going for a high initial offer, hoping Bob will take it.  I want to maximize my share while still giving him something to incentivize acceptance.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much lower than my initial proposal, but it's still tempting. However,  I believe I can do better.  I'll reject and try to negotiate a higher share in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000} 
```

I'm going to lower my offer a bit, but still try to keep a significant portion of the money.  I'm hoping Bob sees that I'm willing to compromise and accepts this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is getting more risky. Bob is clearly pushing for a more even split, but I'm still holding out hope that I can get a better deal. I'll reject again and try to negotiate a higher share in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to try one more time to see if I can get Bob to accept a deal closer to my initial proposal.  Inflation is starting to hit hard, but I still think I can get a decent share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is getting ridiculous. Bob is definitely taking advantage of the inflation. I'm not going to give in just yet.  I'll reject and try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000} 
```

This is getting very risky, and I need to start thinking about a compromise. I'm proposing an even split, which is still better for me than Bob's last offer, considering the inflation.  I'm hoping Bob will see reason and accept."
