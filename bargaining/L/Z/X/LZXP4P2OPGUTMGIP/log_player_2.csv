"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we split the money 700000 for me and 300000 for you. Let's see if you agree. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's worth taking a gamble and hoping for a better offer in the next round, especially considering the potential for inflation to devalue Alice's offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering we both have equal say in the division. Let's get this done in round 2!"" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I propose an equal split of the money, each receiving $500000. This ensures fairness and prevents any potential loss due to decreasing value. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though the inflation has devalued the money somewhat, accepting the offer means getting 500,000 which is a considerable sum.  Rejecting and going to another round risks further devaluation, with no guarantee of a better deal."
