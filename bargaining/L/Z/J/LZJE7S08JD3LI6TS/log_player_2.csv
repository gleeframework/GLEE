"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal, Bob. This offer is a good deal for you now, and it will only get worse with time. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 20% less for me with each passing round, I'd like to try to get a better deal before the value decreases further."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it more fairly, considering the inflation I'm facing.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to negotiate, but this is my final offer. Consider the shrinking pot! 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlthough Alice says this is her final offer, I'm not convinced that she won't negotiate further. Given that the money is worth 36% less for me now, I'm willing to take a risk and try to get a better deal in the next round. If I accept this offer, I'll get $35, which is worth less due to inflation. I'd like to try to get a larger share to offset the decrease in value."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm taking a risk due to inflation, can we meet in the middle?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Take this offer before the inflation eats away at your share even more! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant decrease in value due to inflation (59.04% less than the initial round), I think it's time to accept Alice's offer. While I was hoping to get a better deal, the risk of further decreasing the value of my share is too high. Accepting $40 now might be the best option, even if it's not the most favorable split. Continuing to negotiate may lead to an even smaller share due to inflation."
