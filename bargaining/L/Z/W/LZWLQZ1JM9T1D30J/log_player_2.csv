"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This proposal divides the money equally after accounting for inflation. Please consider it. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While this offer seems fair on the surface, I'm not going to accept it in the first round. My goal is to maximize my gain, and I know the money will be worth less in subsequent rounds. By rejecting, I have the chance to get a better deal for myself later on."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I propose a 60/40 split in my favor, reflecting the potential for inflation in future rounds. This is a fair compromise, considering I'm taking the risk of the money losing value.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose an equal division of the remaining funds. This ensures fairness and prevents any potential loss due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer to get more, the inflation is starting to hurt.  Accepting a 50/50 split now is better than risking getting less in future rounds."
