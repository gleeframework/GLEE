I'm going to be greedy and try to take the vast majority of the money.  Let's see if Bob is happy with just a measly $1000!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I'd love to get more, with inflation, the next round will mean a significant loss for me. 500,000 is still a good amount, and I'm not sure I can do better with the risk of inflation."
