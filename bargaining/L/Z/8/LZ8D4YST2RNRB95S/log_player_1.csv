"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. We can always negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm offering to take $600,000 and leaving $400,000 for Bob. This is a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. No need for complications. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to keep it simple, I like that!

I'll accept his offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

It's a 50-50 split, which is fair. I'll take $500,000 and Bob will take $500,000."
