"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my share is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, so I'm looking at a gain of $640,000 (80% of $800,000).

Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, which is a pretty good compromise considering the situation. I'll accept this offer.
