"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer gives us both a good deal. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm Bob, and I'm looking to maximize my share of the money. While Alice's offer is decent, I'm going to reject and see if I can get a better deal in the next round.  The value of the money is decreasing, but I think I can get more."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm looking to get a slightly larger share, but I still want a fair split.  Let's work together to make this happen.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this offer considers the inflation we both face. It's a good deal for both of us in the long run. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is making the money worth less with each round. This offer is better than what I proposed and ensures I get something before the value drops even further."
