"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm offering to take $8,000 and give Bob $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to think carefully about this offer. Since Bob is offering me $4,000, which is now worth 95% of its original value, that's equivalent to $4,000 / 0.95 = $4,210.53 in the original amount.

I'll accept this offer.
