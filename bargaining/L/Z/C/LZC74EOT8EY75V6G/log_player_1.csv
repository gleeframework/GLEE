"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $400,000 and take $600,000. We can discuss further if you want.""
}
```

This way, I'm taking a bit more, but still leaving Bob with a significant amount. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can find a more balanced split. I'll take $550000 and leave you with $450000.  Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the $450,000 I'd gain is now worth 90% of its original value, which is $405,000.

I'm not too thrilled about this offer, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to propose a counteroffer, as I think I can do better than this."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 81% of its original value now (90% of 90%), I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take $540,000 and leave you with $460,000. This is a slightly better split for me, but I'm still willing to compromise.""
}
```"
