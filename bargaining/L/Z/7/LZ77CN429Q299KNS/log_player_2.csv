Round 3

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, the inflation is working against us both. I propose we each take a slightly larger cut than our previous offers, ensuring a fairer deal in the face of diminishing returns. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000
