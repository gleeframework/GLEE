Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the money in a 70-30 ratio, with me receiving $7000 and you receiving $3000. Let me know if this works for you.

I'm going to reject this offer.  While it's a decent starting point, I want to see if I can get a better deal, especially considering the inflation factor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60-40 split is fairer. Let's see if we can agree on this.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I propose an equal division of the money, with both of us receiving $5000. This maintains fairness while accounting for the decrease in value of the currency. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I would prefer a higher share, the inflation is a major factor. Accepting an equal split is the best option to ensure I get something in this situation."
