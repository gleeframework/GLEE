"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a fair but generous offer.  I'll take 9000, leaving 1000 for Bob.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to accept the offer quickly, before inflation kicks in!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is a risky game! Bob is taking advantage of the inflation. I'll reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}

I'm going to lower my offer slightly, but still leave Bob with a decent amount. I'm hoping that with inflation, this will be a more attractive offer for him."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob is taking advantage of the inflation. I still believe I can get a better deal, so I'll reject this offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer again, but I'm still being generous.  The inflation is starting to hurt Bob, and I think he'll be more willing to compromise."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob is getting increasingly greedy, taking advantage of the inflation.  I'm still holding out for a better deal."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm lowering my offer once more, but I'm still offering a significant portion to Bob. I think the inflation will have a big enough impact on him to make this deal worthwhile."

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is getting more and more unreasonable. I'm not going to cave in to his demands just because of the inflation. I'm confident I can still get a better deal in the next few rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm going to make a bold move and offer a 50/50 split. The inflation has been significant, and I believe it's time to compromise.  Hopefully, this offer will appeal to Bob's sense of fairness."
