Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This offer is a starting point. I'm taking a slightly larger share, recognizing that the money will be worth less for Bob in subsequent rounds. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6400 
# Bob gain: 3600 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob's offer is better for me than what I proposed in round 1, even with the inflation factored in. I'm happy to accept and end the game."
