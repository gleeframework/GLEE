**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting this offer makes the most sense given the rapidly increasing inflation for both of us, especially Alice.  Here's why:

* **My Decreasing Gains:** Each round, my potential gains shrink significantly. Waiting any longer will likely result in even less favorable offers.
* **Alice's Desperation:**  Alice's offer, while still favoring her, shows a willingness to accept a smaller share due to the inflation heavily impacting her potential gains. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Rejecting this offer carries a significant risk that Alice will further lower her offer in a future round, leaving me with potentially much less than $45. 

It's a tough decision, but in a rapidly devaluing situation, taking the sure bet now seems like the most logical choice."
