"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle, no need to negotiate too hard!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a slightly more even split is fairer, given the potential for inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob, the proposal is:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not convinced that a 45-55 split is fair, especially considering the inflation rate is higher for you. I'd like to see a more substantial adjustment to account for that.""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer and will make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise on a 50-50 split, but I think this is the fairest way to split the remaining value of the money, considering the inflation rates.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, with me getting $5,000 and Bob getting $5,000."
