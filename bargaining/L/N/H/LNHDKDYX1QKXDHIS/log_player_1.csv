"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1} 
``` 
 
I propose to keep 99 dollars for myself, and give Bob 1 dollar.  This ensures a quick resolution, and I still get the majority of the money. Since inflation is a factor, I want to secure my portion as quickly as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though I'm losing a lot of money, it's better to accept this offer than risk losing everything. The inflation rate is clearly high for Bob, and he's likely to make increasingly unfavorable offers in the future."
