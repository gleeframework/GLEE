I'm going to be greedy and take almost everything. I figure Bob will accept since he's getting something, and I'm taking almost everything."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to have more, the inflation will make the money worth less in subsequent rounds. Taking 500,000 is better than risking getting less later."
