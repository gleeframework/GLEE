Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose to take $900,000 and give Bob $100,000. 

This is a good starting point as it's a significant amount for Bob, but still leaves me with the majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 this round.  Since we're both losing money with each round, I'm willing to give him a bit more, but I need to keep the majority share to make this worthwhile."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, with the continued inflation and Bob's consistent offer, this seems like the best I can get. It's better than getting nothing!"
