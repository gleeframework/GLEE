Round 5

# Alice's message: Urgent to settle due to inflation 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Even though Alice is getting increasingly desperate, her offer is still not in my favor. The longer the game goes on, the less her share is worth to her due to the 20% inflation. I believe I can push for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""Alice, we need to settle this now. This is my final offer.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The longer this goes on, the more desperate Alice will become.  This offer is strongly in my favor, but I need to convey a sense of urgency to get her to accept before the value of her potential gain diminishes further."
