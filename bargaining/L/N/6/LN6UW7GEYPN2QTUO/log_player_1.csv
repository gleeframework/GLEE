"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I propose that I receive $6000 and Bob receives $4000. I've included a message suggesting a fair division, hoping Bob will see the reasonableness of the offer and accept it, thus ending the game in the first round. This approach aims to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and potentially avoid further rounds where the value of the money decreases for me due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is more fair considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI've decided to reject Bob's offer because, despite the inflation, I believe I can negotiate a better deal. Accepting this offer would mean I lose a significant portion of the original amount due to inflation and the uneven split proposed by Bob. By rejecting and moving to the next round, I aim to make a counteroffer that might be more favorable to me, even considering the increasing impact of inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nIn this round, considering the inflation has reduced the value of my potential gain, I'll propose a slightly different division, aiming to maximize my share while still presenting an offer that might appeal to Bob. This time, I've decided to offer a division that slightly favors me, hoping that the threat of further inflation and the potential for Bob to lose out if we continue will encourage him to accept this offer.\n### {""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's find a middle ground""}\n\n###\n\nThis offer includes a message emphasizing the need to find a middle ground, taking into account the impact of inflation on my potential gains. By framing it as a compromise, I aim to appeal to Bob's reasonableness and increase the likelihood of him accepting this proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This offer accounts for the increasing impact of inflation on your share. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nDespite the significant impact of inflation on my potential gain, I've decided to reject Bob's offer. The proposed division still seems too skewed in Bob's favor, especially considering that he is not affected by inflation. By rejecting this offer and moving to the next round, I aim to either negotiate a better deal or, if the game continues long enough, potentially make the inflation impact so severe that accepting any offer becomes more favorable than continuing.\n###\n\nIt's also worth noting that, at this stage, the psychological aspect of the game becomes increasingly important. By rejecting Bob's seemingly generous offer, I'm also sending a message that I'm willing to endure further rounds and their associated risks rather than accept what I perceive as an unfair division. This might prompt Bob to reconsider his strategy in the next round."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, the impact of inflation on my potential gain is substantial, reducing its value by nearly half compared to the first round. Given this significant decrease, my strategy shifts towards attempting to secure an agreement as soon as possible to minimize further loss. However, I still aim to maximize my share within the constraints of the game.\n### {""alice_gain"": 5600, ""bob_gain"": 4400, ""message"": ""Urgent to settle due to inflation""}\n\n###\n\nThis offer includes a message that highlights the urgency of reaching an agreement due to the severe impact of inflation on my potential gains. By emphasizing this aspect, I hope to convey to Bob that it's in both our interests to conclude the game at this stage, as further rounds would only diminish the value of the money I receive, potentially making it less worthwhile for both of us to continue negotiating.\n###\n\nThe proposed division still slightly favors me, but it's framed within the context of the urgent need to settle, aiming to appeal to Bob's pragmatic side and the mutual benefit of ending the game before the inflation worsens."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we need to settle this now. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nAt this stage, considering the severe impact of inflation on my potential gain and Bob's assertion that this is his final offer, I've decided to accept the proposed division. Continuing the game would likely result in further significant losses due to inflation, making any potential future offer even less favorable. By accepting this offer, I secure a share of the money, albeit reduced, rather than risking further diminishment of its value.\n###\n\nMoreover, Bob's message suggests a firm stance, indicating that he might not be willing to negotiate further. Given the game's dynamics and the substantial decrease in the value of my potential gain, accepting this offer seems to be the most pragmatic decision to make at this point."
