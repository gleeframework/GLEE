"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a clean slate""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $500,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and it allows us to start fresh without either of us feeling like we're getting the short end of the stick."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll take a smaller share this round 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 40/60 split, but I'm willing to negotiate. Since Bob's message suggests he's willing to take a smaller share this round, I'll try to get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a 40/60 split, I'll try to get a better deal by offering a slightly more favorable split. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 420000, ""bob_gain"": 580000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve a bit more""}

I'm offering a 42/58 split, which is a slightly more favorable split for me than Bob's previous offer. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're still being too greedy, meet me in the middle 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is taking a toll on my share! With the money worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I'm getting a bit desperate. Bob's offer is still a 45/55 split, but it's getting closer to my ideal share.
