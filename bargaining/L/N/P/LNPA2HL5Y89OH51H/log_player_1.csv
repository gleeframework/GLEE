"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'm starting with a pretty generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure the deal in the first round.  Since the money loses value more quickly for Bob, it's in his best interest to accept this, rather than risk getting a smaller share later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly less favorable to me than my initial offer.  Even though the money is losing value, I'm going to reject and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm increasing my share slightly, but still offering a decent amount to Bob.  The inflation is hitting him harder, so he might be more inclined to accept something closer to my desired split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While this isn't my ideal split, the inflation is hitting Bob much harder than me.  The money I'd be getting now is worth significantly less than my initial offer. It's in my best interest to accept this offer to avoid getting a smaller share later."
