Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're both losing money with each passing round. Let's split it evenly and be done with this. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, especially for Bob. Waiting longer means we both get significantly less. 
* **Time Pressure:** With only 8 rounds left, the risk of walking away with nothing increases significantly if I keep rejecting offers.  

A guaranteed $5,000 is better than the risk of getting nothing if we fail to agree."
