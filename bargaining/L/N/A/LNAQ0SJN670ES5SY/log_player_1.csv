Let's see if Bob is generous!  I'm starting with a bold proposal, but I'm willing to negotiate if needed. ðŸ˜‰"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It's better to take what I can get than risk getting nothing at all.  I'll accept Bob's offer."
