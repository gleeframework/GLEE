Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This is my first offer, I'm going for a large share as I believe I have the advantage of knowing about the inflation. I'll see how Bob reacts to this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though this is a huge drop from my initial offer, I'm better off accepting this offer. The money I would earn if we go to another round would be worth even less than this, and I risk losing everything if we reach the end without an agreement."
