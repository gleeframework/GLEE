"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be friends""}\n\n###\n\nI hope that my offer is acceptable to Bob. I have tried to divide the money fairly, with me getting a bit more than half since I made the first offer. I hope that the friendly message will also help persuade Bob to accept my offer.\n\nNow it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept my offer or to make a counteroffer. Please let me know what Bob decides."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. We'll both be happier in the long run. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI will reject Bob's offer. Although the offer seems fair at first glance, with the money being worth 20% less than in the first round, I believe I can get a better deal. Let's see what happens in the next round.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nNow it's my turn again. I will make a new offer to Bob.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""I am willing to take a risk""}\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know what Bob decides. I have increased my share in this offer, but the message is intended to make Bob think that I am willing to take a risk and that it might be better for him to accept this offer rather than risking getting an even worse deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since we have already established the pattern, I will directly send my offer for round 3.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""I am willing to take a risk""}\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know what Bob decides. I am sticking with the same offer as before, hoping that Bob will realize that the decreasing value of the money will only make things worse for him if he continues to reject my offers. The message is intended to reinforce this idea and make Bob think twice about rejecting my offer again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable. I'm willing to give you a bit more, but we need to settle this. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","I will accept Bob's offer. Although I was initially hoping to get a better deal, the decreasing value of the money due to inflation is becoming a significant factor. With the money being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I think it's time to settle and accept Bob's offer. The message from Bob also seems reasonable, and I don't want to risk getting an even worse deal in the next round.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI hope that accepting Bob's offer is the right decision, considering the circumstances. Let's conclude the game here."
