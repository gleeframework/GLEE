While Bob's offer is better than his previous one, it's still significantly less than what I offered him in the last round. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to accept an offer that gives me such a small share. I need to keep the pressure on Bob to ensure I get a fair deal before the inflation hits us both too hard."
