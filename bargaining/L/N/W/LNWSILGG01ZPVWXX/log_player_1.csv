{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. How about 55-45?""}

I'm proposing a slightly more favorable split, hoping Bob will be willing to meet me halfway."

# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not going to accept Bob's offer again. I think he's trying to take advantage of the inflation and squeeze me out. I'll try to make one more counteroffer.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""I'm willing to split it down the middle, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the value I bring. Let's meet at 50-50 and call it a day.""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will be willing to compromise and end the game on a relatively equal note."
