"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}

This is a relatively fair split, but I'm hoping Bob will accept to get the game over with!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'd like to make a counteroffer that takes this into account. Here's my response:

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of money. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}

This time, I'm offering a slightly higher share to Bob, hoping he'll accept."
