"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5}
```

I'm starting with a seemingly generous offer, giving Bob a small share. This is to gauge his response and see if he's willing to negotiate or if he'll be more aggressive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 25 
# Bob gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse for me than my initial offer, and the inflation only makes it worse. I'm going to reject this and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm increasing my share a bit from the initial offer. I'm hoping to get a better outcome for myself while still leaving some room for negotiation.  The inflation is starting to hurt, and I need to secure a better share before it becomes too drastic."
