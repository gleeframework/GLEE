"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'm willing to give you a good chunk, but I'm not going to give it all away!""
}
```

This way, I'll get 90% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob will get 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair.  I think a 60/40 split is reasonable, given the potential for inflation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less in the second round, the actual values are:

* Alice gain: 400000 * 0.8 = 320000
* Bob gain: 600000 * 0.8 = 480000

I don't think a 60/40 split is fair, considering I'm getting less value out of the money. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 40% of its original value in the third round (80% of 80% = 64%), I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 640000,
  ""bob_gain"": 360000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think I deserve a bigger share this round. Let's see if you agree!""
}
