"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $1,000,000 evenly, with each of us getting $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted an even split, I'll give you a bit less, but still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with the 60-40 split. I was hoping for a more even split, especially since I was willing to start with a 50-50 split. I think I can do better than this. I'll reject this offer and make a new one in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""You gave me a bit less last time, I'll give you a bit more this time!""}

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, which is a bit more favorable to Bob than my initial 50-50 split, but still a decent offer. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
