"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}

I'm offering Bob $3,000 and keeping $7,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","My gain of $6,000 is worth 20% less than my initial gain of $7,000, so it's equivalent to $5,600. Bob's gain of $4,000 is worth 5% less than his initial gain of $3,000, so it's equivalent to $3,300.

I accept this offer.
