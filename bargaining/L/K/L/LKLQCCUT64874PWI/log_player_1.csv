"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor. It's a generous offer considering I'm the one making the proposal, but I want to see if Bob is willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer. It's still unfair, and I believe I can do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000} 
```

This is a 55/45 split in my favor, which is a significant drop from my previous offer.  I'm willing to compromise, but I still need to get a fair share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still not happy with this offer. While I'm aware of the decreasing value of money, I believe I can do better than a 30/70 split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000}
```

I'm going to propose a 40/60 split. This is a considerable decrease from my previous offer, but it's a compromise I'm willing to make. The value of the money is quickly decreasing, and I don't want to risk getting nothing in the end."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While this offer isn't ideal, with each passing round, the value of the money is significantly decreasing. It's better to secure a 45/55 split than risk getting nothing at all. I'm accepting Bob's offer."
