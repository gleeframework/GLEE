"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, with a message to Bob suggesting that this is a fair division. Since the money is worth 10% less to me with each passing round, I'm incentivized to reach an agreement quickly. By offering Bob 40% of the initial amount, I'm hoping he'll accept and we can conclude the game in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe a more equitable split is in order. This offer accounts for future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, although the money is worth 10% less to me in this round, I believe I can negotiate a better deal. Bob's offer gives him 55% of the initial amount, which I think is too high. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to find a more favorable division."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\nIn this round, I'm taking into account that the money is worth 20% less to me than in the initial round, due to the 10% decrease in value per round. Considering this, I'm offering a slightly more favorable split to Bob compared to my first offer, but still aiming for a higher share for myself to compensate for the loss in value. By suggesting we ""meet in the middle,"" I'm hoping Bob will see this as a compromise and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. Let's close the deal and avoid further losses for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the money is now worth 27.1% less to me than in the first round, and taking into account Bob's message that this is his final offer, I believe accepting this deal is the best option to avoid further losses. The split is relatively close to being even, and the difference in what we gain is minimal. Given the decreasing value of the money to me with each round, it's prudent to accept this offer and conclude the game rather than risking further devaluation."
