"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split and see how it goes!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair split, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so I need to adjust my thinking accordingly.

I'm not thrilled about the 50-50 split, but I think it's a reasonable compromise. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
