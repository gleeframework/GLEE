Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer was heavily skewed in your favor. I'm proposing a more balanced split this time. Consider the declining value of the money - a deal now benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
