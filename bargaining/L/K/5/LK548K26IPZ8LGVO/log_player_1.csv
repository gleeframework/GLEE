"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself, which is a 60-40 split. I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I think we can both do better.  Let's split the money more evenly this time. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to flip the script!

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 40-60 split, especially since the money is worth 20% less for me now. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more for myself to make it worth my while. Consider this offer.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to a 42-58 split, which is a bit more favorable to me, but still a relatively even split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still willing to negotiate, but I need a slightly larger share to make it worth my while.  Let's find a middle ground. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is still trying to negotiate!

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 4:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

Considering the money is worth 48.8% less for me now, I'm not willing to accept a 35-65 split. I need a better offer to make it worth my while, especially since the money is worth significantly less for me than it was in the first round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 490000,
  ""bob_gain"": 510000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit desperate, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. This is my best offer so far.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to a 49-51 split, which is a relatively even split, considering the decreasing value of the money for me."
