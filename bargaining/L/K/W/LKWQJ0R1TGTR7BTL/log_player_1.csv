"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair and reasonable start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60 dollars and Bob gets 40 dollars. I think this is a good starting point, and it's a fair and reasonable split."

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about the 50/50 split, as I was hoping to get a slightly better deal. I'll reject this offer and wait for Bob to make another proposal."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. How about 55/45?""}

I'm adjusting my offer to try to get a slightly better deal, while still being somewhat reasonable."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy about the 55/45 split, and Bob's new offer of 53/47 is still a bit too skewed in his favor. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further."

I'm trying to find a compromise that's closer to my original target of 60/40, but still being somewhat reasonable."
