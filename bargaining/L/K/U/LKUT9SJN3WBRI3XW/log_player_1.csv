"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

This way, I'll get 60% of the original $100, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less now, I'll need to adjust my thinking. If I accept this offer, I'll get 50% of the current value of the money, which is 20% less than the original $100. So, I'll get 0.8 * $100 * 0.5 = $40.

Since I'm getting $40, and the money is worth 20% less than before, I'll consider this a good offer. I'll accept it.
