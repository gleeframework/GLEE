"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to try and get the most money possible in the first round.  I'm assuming Bob will be greedy too, so I'm offering him a small amount, but enough to maybe make him consider accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though the offer is significantly less than what I proposed, it's still better than waiting another round and facing another 20% reduction in the value of my share."
