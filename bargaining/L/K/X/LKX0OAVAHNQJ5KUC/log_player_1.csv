"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to start the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a decent offer 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so I need to be careful with my decisions.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to negotiate further and see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a slightly smaller share, but I'm willing to compromise.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a good deal and not being too greedy, considering the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm still trying to get a good deal 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking its toll, and my gain is worth significantly less than it was initially. Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to keep negotiating and try to get a better deal, but I need to be mindful of the decreasing value of my potential gain."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really taking a bite out of my potential gain now. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit desperate, but I'm still willing to negotiate.""
}
```

I'm trying to be realistic about the decreasing value of the money and accepting a smaller share to try to get a deal done."
