I'm offering Bob a small amount to ensure he accepts, as the money is worth more to me in the first round.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. While 500,000 is a significant amount, I know that I can likely get more than that in the future rounds.  The money is worth the same to me, and the money is worth less to Bob in the subsequent rounds.  I will be able to offer a better deal to Bob in the future and still get a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. While 250,000 is not insignificant, it's a far cry from the 500,000 I was offered last round.  Bob is losing value faster than I am, and I believe I can still get a better deal in the future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer.  Even though the amount I'm being offered is decreasing, it's still a decent sum.  I believe that I can get a much better deal in the future rounds. The money is worth less and less to Bob with each passing round, and I'm confident that he will eventually accept a more favorable offer for me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.

Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. While 375,000 is a decent amount, I'm still confident I can secure a better deal. Bob's money is worth less and less, and he will be more desperate for an agreement as we move into the later rounds.  I'm in a strong position to get a larger share."

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. While 416,667 is a reasonable amount, I'm confident I can do better. With each round, the value of the money is decreasing for Bob at a rapid pace.  I believe I can negotiate a more favorable deal for myself in the remaining rounds."
