Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer in Round 3 seems worse at first glance, it's important to consider the inflation:

* **Bob:** His offer is worth 36% less than the original $1000, meaning he gets roughly $640. 
* **Alice:** Her offer is worth 9.75% less, meaning she gets roughly $5450.

Since Bob is losing a significant amount of money with each round due to inflation, accepting this offer is the better choice in the long run. The longer the game goes on, the less valuable the money becomes."
