"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to negotiate if you want more.""
}
```

I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor, but I'm open to negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I want a fair share too. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, but I'm not getting a great deal from Bob's offer. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's still a bit too generous for you, I think. I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I want a bigger cut. How about 45 for me and 55 for you?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, the money is worth even less now, so I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to give you a 50/50 split. It's a fair deal, and we can both walk away happy.""
}
```"
