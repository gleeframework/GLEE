"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

This way, I'll get 90% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob will get 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new offer, I'll get $100,000, which is worth 10% less than the $900,000 I proposed in the first round, and Bob will get $900,000, which is worth 5% less than the $1,000,000 he proposed in the first round.

I'll reject this offer since it's not a good deal for me. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In round 3, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round (10% less in round 2 and another 10% less now), I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the decrease in value.

Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

This way, I'll get a larger share, but still leave some room for Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new offer, I'll get $300,000, which is worth 70.1% less than the $900,000 I proposed in the first round, and Bob will get $700,000, which is worth 30.74% less than the $1,000,000 he proposed in the first round.

I'll accept this offer since it's the best deal I can get at this point.
