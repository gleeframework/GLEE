Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

Let's see if Alice will take a more balanced deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get more, considering the inflation and limited rounds, a 50/50 split is a fair outcome."
