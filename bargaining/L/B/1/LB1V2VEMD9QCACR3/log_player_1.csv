Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

While I would have preferred a slightly larger share, accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The money is losing value rapidly. Waiting any longer significantly diminishes the returns for both of us.
* **Fair Offer:** A 50/50 split is inherently fair. While I was aiming for a bit more, accepting this prevents further losses due to inflation. 
* **Uncertainty:** There's no guarantee that I can secure a better offer from Bob in subsequent rounds. He might become even more insistent on a 50/50 split."
