"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the $10,000 and leave 20% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","My gain is worth 10% less, so I'll get $7,000 * 0.9 = $6,300.
Bob's gain is worth 5% less, so he'll get $3,000 * 0.95 = $2,850.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
