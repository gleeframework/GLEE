"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is a generous offer, but I'm trying to be realistic and consider the fact that I don't know how the inflation will affect Bob's perception of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 500,000 is now worth 400,000 in real value, and Bob's gain of 500,000 is worth 450,000. I'll take it!
