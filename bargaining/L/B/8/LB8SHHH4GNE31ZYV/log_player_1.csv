I propose a 90/10 split, keeping $900,000 for myself and giving Bob $100,000."

I'm willing to reduce my share further to $700,000, giving Bob $300,000. We are approaching the point where we'll both lose significantly due to inflation, so let's come to an agreement."

{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's keep going.  The inflation is hurting us both, but I'm still hoping for a better outcome.  I'll make a counter-proposal in the next round."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I'm making a final attempt to reach an agreement. I'll take $600,000 and give Bob $400,000.  If we keep rejecting each other, the money we can both get will shrink to nearly nothing."
