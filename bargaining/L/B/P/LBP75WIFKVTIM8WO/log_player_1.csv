"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I don't think I should accept an offer that gives him a larger share of the money. I'll try to make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, my offer for Round 3 is:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800
}

I'm adjusting my share to account for the inflation, but I'm still trying to maintain a slight advantage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze Bob's offer for Round 4:

{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}

Considering the inflation, my share of $4500 is actually a decent deal, and I think it's better than continuing the negotiation. I'll accept this offer and end the game."
