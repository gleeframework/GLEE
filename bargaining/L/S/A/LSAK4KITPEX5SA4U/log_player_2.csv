Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm willing to make one more deal. 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a tough situation, but it's clear Alice is playing hardball. While accepting this offer means losing a significant chunk of the initial value, it's better than risking another round. If I reject, there's a good chance the money will be worth even less to me in the next round, and Alice might not offer me anything at all."
