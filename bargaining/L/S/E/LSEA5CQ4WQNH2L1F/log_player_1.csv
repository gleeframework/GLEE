Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to offer Bob $1 and keep the rest for myself. He's likely to reject this offer, but I'm hoping he'll be tempted by the prospect of getting anything at all. Since we're playing with inflation, I want to secure as much of the money as possible in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, this offer is fair and secures a significant portion of the money.  Since Bob is getting a larger share, I'm sure he'll accept this in the next round.  I don't want to risk losing everything by waiting for a better offer."
