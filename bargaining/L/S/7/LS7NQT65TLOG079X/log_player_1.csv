"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This way, we both get a significant amount, and I'm willing to compromise to get the game started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to adjust my expectations. Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, which is a good compromise considering the circumstances. I'll accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
