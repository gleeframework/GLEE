"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal quickly, Bob. This offer is highly favorable to me, but it still gives you a significant sum. Consider the impact of inflation - it only gets worse with time.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle, Alice.  We both get a fair share, and we avoid the risk of inflation eroding our gains.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want this money. I'm proposing a more realistic split that reflects the time pressure. This is your last chance for a decent sum before inflation eats away at your potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
