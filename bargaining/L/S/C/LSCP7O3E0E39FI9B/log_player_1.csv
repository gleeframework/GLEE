"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good start""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, Alice proposes to take 60% of the money ($600,000) and leave 40% ($400,000) for Bob. She attaches a message suggesting that this division is a fair starting point. Now, it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept this offer or proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer. Remember, with each round, the value of the money decreases by 5% due to inflation, adding an element of urgency to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script, I think 60-40 is fair, but for me this time! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nIn this response, Alice rejects Bob's counteroffer of flipping the original proposal to favor him. By rejecting, Alice decides to proceed to the next round, where she will make a new proposal, keeping in mind the decreasing value of the money due to inflation. The game continues with Alice aiming to find a more favorable or acceptable division."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 55-45 is a compromise""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, Alice proposes a new division, offering to take 55% of the money ($550,000) and giving Bob 45% ($450,000). She suggests this as a compromise, aiming to meet Bob halfway between their previous offers. The message conveys Alice's willingness to negotiate and find a mutually acceptable agreement as the game progresses and the value of the money continues to decrease due to inflation."
