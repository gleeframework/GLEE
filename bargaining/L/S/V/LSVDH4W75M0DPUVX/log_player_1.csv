"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### Alice: Round 1\n\nI'll propose a division that slightly favors me to start, considering the inflation factor that affects me but not Bob. I aim to negotiate a balance that accounts for the decreasing value of money for me in subsequent rounds.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a 60-40 split. It's a good compromise, and we both get a substantial amount without dragging this out, considering inflation will eat into my share over time.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think a 60-40 split in my favor is fairer, considering the inflation affects you more than me. Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","### Alice: Round 2\n\nConsidering the impact of inflation, the offer now values the money 20% less for me. This means that the $4000 offered is actually worth $3200 in real terms for me. Given this, accepting the offer now might not be the best strategy, as it sets a low precedent and significantly undervalues my share, especially considering the initial proposal I made.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nPlease proceed with my rejection to Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### Alice: Round 3\n\nGiven that we're now in the third round and the money's value continues to decrease for me due to inflation, it's crucial to propose a division that acknowledges this factor while remaining attractive to Bob. Since my previous offer was rejected and Bob's counteroffer didn't meet my expectations, I'll adjust my strategy slightly, aiming for a more balanced split that considers the devaluation of money for me over the rounds.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering the ongoing inflation and the need for a mutually beneficial agreement, I propose a 58-42 split. This adjustment shows my willingness to find a middle ground, acknowledging the decreasing value of money for me while ensuring we both benefit.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know Bob's response."
