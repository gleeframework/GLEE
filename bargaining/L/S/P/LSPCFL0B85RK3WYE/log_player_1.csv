Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do a bit better. I'll take $5,500, and you can have $4,500. It's a fair deal, and we can avoid further rounds of negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500
