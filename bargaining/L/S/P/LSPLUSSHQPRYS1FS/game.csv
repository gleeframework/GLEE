,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"I think we can do better than your initial offer, Alice! How about I take $55 and you get $45? It's a more even split, and we can both walk away happy.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
58.0,42.0,"Okay, Bob, let's find a middle ground. I'll come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $58 for me and $42 for you?  Remember, the value decreases with each round, so let's make a deal!",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
43.0,57.0,"I see we're getting closer, Alice! Considering the inflation is affecting your share more than mine, I'll try to meet you halfway. How about I take $57 and you get $43? It's a fair deal, given the circumstances.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
56.0,44.0,"Bob, it's important we settle this soon.  Time is literally money for me in this game! I'm willing to come down to $56, leaving you with $44.  Let's wrap this up.",Alice,5,

,,,Bob,7,reject
41.0,59.0,"I know you said that was your final offer, Alice, but I'm not convinced. Given the significant impact of inflation on your share, I think it's only fair that I take $59 and you get $41. It's getting late in the game, and I'm willing to wait it out.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
53.0,47.0,"Bob, I'm serious! This inflation is no joke.  We're running out of time, and I need to get something out of this deal. $53 for me, $47 for you. Take it or leave it!",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
40.0,60.0,"I'm not budging, Alice. With the inflation eating away at your share, I think it's time for me to take the larger slice. I'll take $60, and you can have $40. If you don't accept, I'm happy to wait and see what the next rounds bring.",Bob,10,
