"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept.  Since I get to propose first, I want to secure a good chunk of the money early on before inflation kicks in."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, inflation is already a factor and I don't want to risk getting nothing. 50/50 is a fair split, and I don't want to push my luck."
