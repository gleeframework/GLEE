I'm starting with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping to get the game over quickly and avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer. Even though the inflation hurts me more, I can still get a better deal by playing the game out. I'm hoping Bob will get more reasonable in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer slightly, but still try to maintain a significant advantage for myself. The inflation is starting to be a concern, so I need to strike a balance between getting a good deal and avoiding a stalemate."
