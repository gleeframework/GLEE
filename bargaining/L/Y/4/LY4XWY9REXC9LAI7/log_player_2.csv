{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Alice, your offer was kind, but doesn't make sense with the inflation.  Let's be realistic: I'll take 70% and you take 30%.""}

# Alice's message: Okay, I'm willing to budge a bit, but I need more than 30%. How about 45 for me and 55 for you? Let's try to find a compromise.
