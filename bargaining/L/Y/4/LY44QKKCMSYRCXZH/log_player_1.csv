"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I believe a more even split is in order. Let's try 60/40 for me this time. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, my gain of 40 in this round is actually worth $32 (40 * 0.8).

I'll reject this offer since I'm not getting a fair share.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my offer will be worth 64% of the initial $100, which is $64 (100 * 0.8^2).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 64,
  ""bob_gain"": 36,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think this is a fair split.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, Alice. I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to go. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, so my gain of 50 in this round is actually worth $5.12 (50 * 0.516).

I'll accept this offer, as it's a 50/50 split and I'm not getting a better offer.
