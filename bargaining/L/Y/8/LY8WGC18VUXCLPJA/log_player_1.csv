Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous. Accept this offer before inflation eats away at the value even more. It's a win-win! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most logical choice given the circumstances of inflation. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  The longer the game goes on, the less the money is worth to both of us. However, the inflation rate is significantly higher for Bob. This means he's feeling the pressure more with each passing round.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Rejecting this offer means gambling on Bob offering an even better deal in the next round. However, there's no guarantee of that, and the value will decrease further. 
* **Current Offer:** While not great, getting $4,500 now is better than potentially getting a slightly better offer in Round 5 that's been significantly devalued by inflation.

In essence, it's better to take a decent deal now than risk getting a worse deal later in a rapidly depreciating situation."
