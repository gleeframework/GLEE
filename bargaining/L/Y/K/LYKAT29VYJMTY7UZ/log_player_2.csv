"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. Let's split it 90/10, and we can both walk away with something.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, I'm willing to compromise a bit. Let's split it 65/35. That's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time!  I'm coming down to 55/45.  Let's settle this before inflation eats away at the value.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous!  I'm offering you 48% and keeping 52% for myself. This is my final offer before we both lose out on any money. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Reason: Although not ideal, accepting Alice's offer guarantees Bob a reasonable share of the money before inflation further erodes its value. With time running out, the risk of walking away with nothing significantly outweighs the potential for a slightly better deal in later rounds.
