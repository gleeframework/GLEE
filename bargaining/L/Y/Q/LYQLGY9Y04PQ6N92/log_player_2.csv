Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but your offer doesn't reflect the fact that the value of your potential gain decreases with each round. I propose 55/45. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
