"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40 to start, we can reassess later.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $60 and Bob getting $40. My message to Bob is that we can reassess the split later if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve more for my patience. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 5% inflation, my $60 gain from the previous round is now worth $57.20, and the total amount is now $95.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about the 30-70 split, but I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the total amount is now worth $90.90 ($100 x 0.9091).

I'll make a new offer, trying to get a better deal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve more for my patience too.""
}
```

My offer is a 45-55 split in my favor, with me getting $45.49 and Bob getting $54.41. My message to Bob is similar to his message in round 2."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting impatient, but I'll give you a very low offer this time. Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is really catching up!

In the first round, the money was worth $100. With 14.26% inflation, the money I gain is now worth 100 x 0.8554 = $85.54, which is the original $60 gain. The total amount is now $85.54.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about the 20-80 split, but I'll think about it...
