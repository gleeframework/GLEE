"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make the first offer. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}

I'm offering Bob 30 dollars, which is a generous offer considering the game is just starting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Considering the inflation, the actual amounts I'd gain are 48 dollars and Bob would gain 32 dollars. It's still a decent offer, but I'm not sure if I want to settle for less than 50% of the total. I'll reject this offer for now.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","With the inflation in mind, I'll make a new offer. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}

I'm aiming for a slightly higher share this time, considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to make a fair split now. Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, the actual amounts I'd gain are 25.5 dollars and Bob would gain 25.5 dollars. It's a 50-50 split, which is a reasonable offer considering the circumstances. I'll accept this offer.
