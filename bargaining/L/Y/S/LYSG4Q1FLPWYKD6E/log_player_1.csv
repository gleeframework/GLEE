"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the money and leaving 40% for Bob. This is a relatively fair split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll match your fair split, but let's see if we can do better next round. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, and Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, I'll actually get $50, which is the same as Bob's gain. This is a good opportunity to take the deal and avoid further inflation.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
