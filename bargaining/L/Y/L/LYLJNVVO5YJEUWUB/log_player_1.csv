"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly considering the inflation impact""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering $55 for myself and $45 for Bob, emphasizing the fairness of the split while considering the impact of inflation. It's crucial to start with a reasonable offer that acknowledges the devaluation of money over rounds but still aims for a mutually acceptable division. This initial offer sets the tone for negotiations, encouraging Bob to consider the effects of inflation on both our parts. By starting with a slightly higher amount for myself, I'm also positioning for potential adjustments in subsequent rounds while remaining open to finding a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn to propose a fair split considering the inflation. Let's close the deal! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, despite the inflation adjustment, his proposal doesn't adequately reflect the disproportionate impact of inflation on my potential gain. By accepting this offer, I would be at a disadvantage compared to if we had settled in the first round. Given that the money is worth 10% less to me now, I need a proposal that better compensates for this loss in value. Rejecting this offer gives me the opportunity to propose a new division in the next round that more fairly accounts for the differing rates of inflation affecting our gains."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Considering the increased impact of inflation, let's adjust the split to find a middle ground.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I've adjusted my offer to reflect the ongoing impact of inflation on both our parts, while also considering Bob's previous offer. By slightly decreasing my proposed gain and increasing Bob's share compared to my initial offer, I'm attempting to find a more acceptable middle ground that acknowledges the devaluation of money for both of us. This approach aims to be more palatable to Bob, as it shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise, while still protecting my interests in light of the inflationary pressure."
