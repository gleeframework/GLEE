"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5} 
```

I propose to keep $95 and give Bob $5. This leaves room for negotiation in the next round, while still ensuring I secure the majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher share, accepting this offer is the best option. Inflation is already impacting the value of my potential earnings, and rejecting this offer means the next round will likely be even less favorable due to further inflation. It's better to secure a good portion of the money now than risk getting nothing at all."
