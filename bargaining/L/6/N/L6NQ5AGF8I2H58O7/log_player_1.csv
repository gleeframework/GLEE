Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a 55/45 split. It's a better deal for me, considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the increasing inflation, I need a bigger share. 58/42 is my new offer. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While the effects of inflation are becoming more significant, accepting 4200 is a poor outcome for me.  The longer this goes on, the more desperate Bob will become as his potential gains shrink.  I need to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5700,
""bob_gain"": 4300,
""message"": ""Bob, the inflation is hurting both of us.  Let's be realistic. I'm willing to come down slightly from my previous offer:  57/43""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation. My offer is a concession, designed to look appealing, but still keeps a significant portion of the money for myself.  The clock is ticking."
