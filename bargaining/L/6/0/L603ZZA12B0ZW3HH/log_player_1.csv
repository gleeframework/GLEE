"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate too much""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. This is a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable given that we're both starting with an equal amount of information and no particular reason to favor one side over the other."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $3,000 is now worth $2,700.

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a bit too skewed in his favor. I'd like to get a bit more. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but not that much""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42-58 split, which is a bit more generous than my initial offer, but still not too extreme."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to my goal, but I'm still willing to negotiate 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $3,500 is now worth $2,545.15.

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's still a bit too skewed in his favor. I'd like to get a bit more. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting closer to my goal, let's meet in the middle""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, which is a bit more balanced than my previous offers."
