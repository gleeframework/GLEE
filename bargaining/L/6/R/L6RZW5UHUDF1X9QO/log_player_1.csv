"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate, it's fair!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a straightforward and fair division of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a good deal, but I want a bit more for myself. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth 90% of its original value, so the total amount of money is now 90 dollars.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about giving him 60 dollars, but it's still a decent offer. I'll have to think carefully about it...

```

```

I'll reject this offer and see if I can do better in the next round."

  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I still want a fair share!""

```

I'll accept this offer, hoping it's the best I can get."
