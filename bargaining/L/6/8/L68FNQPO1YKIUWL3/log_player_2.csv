Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's make a deal. I propose I take $70 and you get $30. This way we both win something and avoid the risk of inflation eating away at our potential gains.

# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is fairer. It's still a good deal for both of us, and we can avoid the risk of inflation eating away at the money further.""}

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems like we both want to leave with a decent share. I'm willing to compromise. How about a 55/45 split in my favor? We are running out of time before inflation makes this whole thing pointless. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
