It's worth a shot to see if I can get a better deal!  Let's see what Alice proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  Since I rejected Alice's offer, I'm hoping she'll be more willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though the money is worth less, I'm accepting this offer.  It's better than the 60/40 split I proposed, and I'm not sure I can do any better with the inflation rate. It's important to make sure we both get something."
