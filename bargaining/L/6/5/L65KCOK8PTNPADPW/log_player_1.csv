"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, then negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself. This is a relatively equal split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, now it's your turn to negotiate 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, the new amounts are:

* My gain: 630,000 (70% of 900,000)
* Bob's gain: 450,000 (50% of 900,000)

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
