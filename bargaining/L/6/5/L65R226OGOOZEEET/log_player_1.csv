"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can finalize the deal.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split, with me getting $8,000 and Bob getting $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal this time. Consider it! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the values are:

Alice's gain: $4,000 (down 50% from $8,000)
Bob's gain: $4,800 (down 76% from $6,000, but still a 60-40 split)

I'll reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping for a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
