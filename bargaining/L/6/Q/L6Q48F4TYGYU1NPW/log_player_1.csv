"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This offer gives Bob a small amount, but it's likely he will accept as he knows you can offer him less in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000} 
``` 

I'm offering Bob a larger share this time, but still a smaller amount overall. It's a risk, but the inflation is starting to hurt me, and I need to find a way to end the game sooner."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

The inflation is hitting hard, and Bob's offer is getting closer to what I would have offered myself. I'm taking this offer to stop the losses from inflation."
