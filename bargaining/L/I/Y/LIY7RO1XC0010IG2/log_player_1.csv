"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take less""
}
```

This way, I'm offering to take 60% of the original 100$, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept this offer because I think I can do better than 70% of the remaining 100$. The money is worth 20% less now, so I'm looking for a higher percentage to account for the inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a bit more, but I'm willing to compromise""
}
```

This way, I'm offering to take 80% of the remaining 100$, which is a bit more than my previous offer, but I'm still leaving some room for Bob to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you most of it, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of again! 
# Alice gain: 85 
# Bob gain: 15 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob's offer is quite generous! Considering the inflation, I'll think carefully about it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer. With the money being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, 85% of the remaining 100$ is still a decent amount, and I don't want to risk going into further rounds and potentially getting less."
