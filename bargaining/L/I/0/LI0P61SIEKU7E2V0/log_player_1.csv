"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

I'm offering to take 70 dollars, leaving 30 dollars for Bob. This way, I'll get a decent chunk of the money, and Bob will still get a reasonable amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my expectations. Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a reasonable one, given the current circumstances.
