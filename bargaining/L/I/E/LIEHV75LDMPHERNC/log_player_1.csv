Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 43 
# Bob gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is offering a slight compromise, it's still heavily skewed in his favor.  The longer this goes on, the more inflation eats into my potential gains. I need to push for a more equitable split soon, or I risk getting a very bad deal."
