It's a good offer, but I'm hoping for more.  I'll see if I can do better in the next round."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  Let's see if she takes it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

With the inflation, I'm not sure I can get a better deal.  I'll take the 50/50 split."
