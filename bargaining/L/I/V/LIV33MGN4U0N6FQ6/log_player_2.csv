"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me, I'll make a proposal that takes that into account. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 4200,
""alice_gain"": 5800}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll decide based on the relative values. Since my gain is 4500 and Alice's gain is 5500, it seems like Alice is getting a slightly better deal, but not significantly so. I'll decide to reject this offer as well.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the further reduction in the value of the money due to inflation, I'll make a new proposal. Since the money is worth 19% less for me and 9.75% less for Alice compared to the first round, I'll aim for a slightly higher share to compensate for the reduced value.

{""bob_gain"": 4600,
""alice_gain"": 5400}"
