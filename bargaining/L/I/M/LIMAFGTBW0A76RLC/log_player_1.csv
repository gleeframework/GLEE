"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide it fairly""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I'm proposing to take 60% of the money ($600,000) and give Bob 40% ($400,000). I've included a message suggesting that this is a fair division, in the hopes that Bob will accept and we can end the game here.\n\nYour turn! What does Bob say?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This offer accounts for the time-value of money and ensures we both benefit from a swift resolution. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, even considering the effects of inflation, I believe I can get a better deal in the next round or that my next proposal will be more favorable to me. The difference in the devaluation rate between us (20% for me vs 10% for Bob) might give me leverage in future rounds.\n\nLet's proceed to Round 3.\n\n###\n\nYour turn! Please let me know the outcome of my decision."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is more than fair""}\n\nIn this offer, I've slightly adjusted the proportions from my initial proposal to account for the effects of inflation. I'm taking into account that with each passing round, the money is worth less to both of us, but more significantly less to me. I'm hoping that by acknowledging this in my message, Bob will see the reasonableness of the offer and accept it, ending the game.\n\nYour turn! What does Bob say?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out! Let's settle this now and avoid further losses from inflation. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on the value of the money for me (a reduction of 48.8% from the original value), I believe accepting this offer is the best course of action. The difference in the offers is getting smaller, and the risk of losing more value to inflation outweighs the potential gain from holding out for another round. Bob's message also hints at a sense of urgency, suggesting that he might not be willing to compromise much further. Accepting now secures a significant amount, even after accounting for inflation, and ends the game before the money loses even more value."
