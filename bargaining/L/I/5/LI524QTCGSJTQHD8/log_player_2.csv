"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know when it's my turn to propose."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's try a 55/45 split in my favor. The money is losing value!""}\n\n###\n\nPlease relay this offer to Alice. I'm looking forward to her response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable and split the remaining value equally. This way, we both get something. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI'll take the 50/50 split. With inflation, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly, so I think it's best to accept this offer and end the game before the value drops further."
