"Round 1

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, but that's not agreeable.  This is a more balanced offer for us both.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle of our previous offers 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, it's still beneficial for me to hold out a little longer. The inflation factor means she'll be more motivated to make a better offer soon."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Time is running out, and the money is shrinking.  This is a fair offer that prevents further losses for both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's compromise before it's too late 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  While not ideal, Alice is getting closer to a more reasonable split. Given the increasing inflation rate and the fact that half the rounds are gone, accepting now guarantees me something. Holding out further carries a significant risk that we both end up with nothing."
