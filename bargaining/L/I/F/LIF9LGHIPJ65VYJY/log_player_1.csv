}"

# Bob's message: I'll give you most of it, but I still want a small share 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With Bob's offer, I'd gain $70, which is worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain of $30 would be worth 20% less than in the first round.

I'm not sure if I want to give Bob a larger share, considering the inflation factor. I'd rather negotiate further.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer in round 2 was 70/30, I'll try to counter with a more balanced offer. Here it is:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's split it 60/40!""
}"

# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","With Bob's offer, I'd gain $75, which is worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain of $25 would be worth 48.8% less than in the first round. Considering the inflation factor, Bob is getting a relatively better deal this round.

I'm not sure if I want to give Bob a larger share, but I'm also not sure if I can do better than this offer. I'll think carefully before deciding.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to counter Bob's previous 75/25 offer. Since the money is worth less for Bob with each round, I'll aim for a higher share for myself. Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""You're getting a good deal, but I need more. 80/20, take it or leave it!""
}"

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you most of it, but I'm not giving up yet 
# Alice gain: 85 
# Bob gain: 15 
Do you accept this offer?","With Bob's offer, I'd gain $85, which is worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain of $15 would be worth 67.23% less than in the first round. Considering the inflation factor, Bob is getting an even worse deal this round.

I'm not sure if I want to give Bob a larger share, but I'm starting to think that I might be able to get a better deal if I push a bit harder. On the other hand, Bob's offer is getting more and more unfavorable for him, so I might want to consider accepting to avoid a worse deal later on.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer, taking into account that Bob's offer in round 6 was 85/15. I'll aim for an even higher share for myself. Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""You're running out of time, Bob! 90/10, take it or leave it!""
}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you almost all of it, but I'm not giving up completely 
# Alice gain: 95 
# Bob gain: 5 
Do you accept this offer?","With Bob's offer, I'd gain $95, which is worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain of $5 would be worth 79.03% less than in the first round. Considering the inflation factor, Bob is getting an extremely unfavorable deal this round.

I'm starting to think that I should take this offer, as it's likely that Bob will only get a worse deal in the next round. Plus, I'm getting a very favorable deal myself.
