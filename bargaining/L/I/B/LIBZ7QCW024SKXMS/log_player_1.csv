"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take 3/10, leave me with most of the pie 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting move by Bob! Since the money is worth 5% less for Bob, he's effectively proposing a 60/40 split, which is a bit lopsided. However, it's still a significant amount of money, and I don't want to risk losing more in future rounds.

I'll accept this offer.
