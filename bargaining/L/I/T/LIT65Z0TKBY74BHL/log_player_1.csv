I'm going to start with a pretty aggressive offer, hoping to secure a large share of the money early on.  Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer to keep more, the inflation is a significant factor.  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me at least $50, and it's better than risking getting less in the next round."
