"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share. I'll give you a small portion, but I'm hoping we can work together to get a better deal in future rounds.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $100, and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve more. This is my opening offer. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $16 (40% of $40) is worth 90% of the $16 I would have gotten in the first round, which is $14.40.

I'm not sure if this is a good deal, but I'll consider it. I'd rather not proceed to the next round if I can get a better deal now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
