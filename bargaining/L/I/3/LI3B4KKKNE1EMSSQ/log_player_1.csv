"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you a small share to keep you interested!""
}
```

I'm offering you $2,000, and I'll take the remaining $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve more since I'm the one making the offer. How about we split it 60/40? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more careful with the inflation.

In this round, the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the previous round, so I'll have to adjust my decision accordingly.

I'll reject this offer. The money I would gain ($4,000) is worth less than the money I could have gained in the previous round ($8,000), so I'm not interested in this proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55/45 is a fair split considering the inflation. Let's meet in the middle!""
}
```

I'm offering you $4,500, and I'll take the remaining $5,500."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think I deserve more considering the current value of money. How about we split it 70/30? 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on me!

In this round, the money I gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, which means I'm getting less than half of what I could have gained initially.

Considering this, I'll have to be very careful with my decision. However, I think $3,000 is a relatively small amount, and I'm not sure if I'll get a better offer in the next round.

I'll accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
