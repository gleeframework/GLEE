I propose to keep 900,000 dollars for myself, and give Bob 100,000 dollars.  This is a very generous offer, considering the inflation rates, and I'm confident he'll accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 855000, ""bob_gain"": 145000}
```

I'm offering Bob 145,000 dollars.  While this is a significant decrease from my initial offer, it's still a decent amount considering the inflation.  I believe this is a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Bob's offer is getting increasingly unfair due to the inflation. I'll reject it and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again to 750,000 for myself, and giving Bob 250,000. This is a significant sacrifice for me due to the inflation, but I believe it's still the best way to secure a deal."
