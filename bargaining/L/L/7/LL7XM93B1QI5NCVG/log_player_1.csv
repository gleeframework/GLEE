"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself.  This is a generous starting offer, but I want to see if he's willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly less favorable to me than my initial proposal. I'll reject this offer and see if he's willing to budge in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself. I'm lowering my offer slightly, but still believe it's a fair compromise given the inflation affecting Bob's gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is significantly impacting Bob's gains. Accepting this offer is the best way to secure some money and avoid the risk of getting even less in future rounds."
