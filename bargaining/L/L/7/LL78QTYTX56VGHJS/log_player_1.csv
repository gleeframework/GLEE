I'm going for a 90/10 split in my favor.  I figure Bob will be tempted to accept, especially since he doesn't know about the inflation.  Let's see how it goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

While I'd prefer more, a 50/50 split is still a good outcome considering the inflation. It's better than getting nothing if we keep rejecting each other's offers!"
