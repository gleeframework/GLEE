I'm going to reject this offer.  While it's a decent starting point, I want to see if I can get a better deal, especially considering the inflation factor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to propose a 60/40 split in my favor. Since I'm the one proposing now, I'll aim for a slightly better deal than Alice offered. Let's see if she accepts!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money.  Accepting a 50/50 split is the best option to ensure I don't lose out further."
