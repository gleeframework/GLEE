Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous. This is a better deal than you'll get next round! 
# Alice gain: 510000 
# Bob gain: 490000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\n### I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. The 5% decrease in value for me isn't as bad as the 10% decrease for Bob, so I have more room to negotiate. Let's see what Bob thinks of my next proposal.\n\n###\n\n### Next round, I'll propose: {""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I think 58% for me and 42% for you is a fair deal now.""}\n\n###\n\n### Your turn, Bob!"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n### As planned, I'll send my offer as previously determined.\n\n###\n\n### {""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I think 58% for me and 42% for you is a fair deal now.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is money, Alice! Let's settle this now. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\n### I'll accept this offer because, considering the decreasing value of the money due to inflation, waiting further doesn't seem beneficial for either of us. The difference in the loss of value between us is significant, but Bob's offer is reasonable given the circumstances, especially since he claims it's his final offer. Continuing might lead to further loss for both of us, making this a sensible point to conclude the negotiations."
