  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. We can always negotiate from here.""

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob wants to go back to the original 60-40 split, but with the new values due to inflation. Here's my response:

I'd like to propose a new offer that takes into account the inflation difference."

  ""alice_gain"": 490000,

# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is still pushing for a 60-40 split, but is willing to compromise with a 55-45 split. Considering the inflation and the fact that the money is worth less for me than for Bob, I'll think carefully about this offer. Here's my response:
