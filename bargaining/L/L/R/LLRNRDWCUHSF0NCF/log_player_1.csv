"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly less than fair split, but I think it's a good compromise 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less for me due to inflation, I'll consider the effective gain as follows:
My gain: 40 / 0.95 = 42.11 (approximately)
Bob's gain: 60 / 0.9 = 66.67 (approximately)

I'm not sure if this is a good compromise, but I'll accept the offer to move on to the next round.
