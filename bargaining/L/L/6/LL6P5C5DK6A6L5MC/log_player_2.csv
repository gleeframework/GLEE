Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing a waiting game, knowing that inflation works in her favor. However, accepting an offer below 50% is a bad deal for Bob, even considering inflation. It's time to push back harder and show Alice that Bob is serious about getting a fair share."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm not buying it 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting a 44/56 split is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Severe Inflation:** With each round, Bob loses a significant chunk of his potential earnings. Accepting now mitigates further losses.
* **Alice's Strategy:**  Alice is clearly playing a waiting game, banking on Bob's desperation as inflation eats into his share. Accepting now cuts her strategy short.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing carries the risk of Alice offering even less in future rounds, potentially leading to a worse outcome than the current offer.

It's a tough decision, but accepting now secures a reasonable sum for Bob, even if it means Alice gets the larger share."
