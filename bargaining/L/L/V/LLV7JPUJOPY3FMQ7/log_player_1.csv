"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

I'm offering Bob a small share, but I'm keeping the majority of the money for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, I'm not as eager to give up as much as I was in the first round. However, Bob's offer is a bit more generous than mine was, so I'll consider it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","In Round 3, the money is worth 20% less than in the first round. I'll make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm keeping a larger share, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is getting less valuable by the round, and Bob's offer is still a bit more generous than mine was in Round 3. I'll consider it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the offer and get $55. It's not the best deal, but it's better than nothing at this point."
