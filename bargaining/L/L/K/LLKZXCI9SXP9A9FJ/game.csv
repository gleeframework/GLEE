,,,Bob,1,reject
55.0,45.0,Your offer was a bit imbalanced. Let's be fairer and consider the rapid inflation working against you. I propose a 55/45 split in your favor.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
60.0,40.0,"Bob, let's be realistic. The inflation hurts me more, but your offer still heavily favors you in the long run. I'm sticking with 60/40.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
52.0,48.0,"Alice, I understand the inflation is hitting you harder, but I'm trying to find a middle ground. This offer is a slight improvement for you while still being reasonable for me.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
58.0,42.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm willing to compromise slightly, but 52 is still too low considering the inflation difference.  I propose 58/42.",Alice,5,
