  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 40/60 is a fairer split considering the inflation risk. Your turn! 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{
