Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a pretty aggressive offer, hoping to secure most of the money in the first round.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is a huge swing in his favor, and even though the money is worth less to me, I'm not going to accept such a drastic change. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground here.  My offer is still favorable to me, but it's a significant concession from my initial proposal. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise."
