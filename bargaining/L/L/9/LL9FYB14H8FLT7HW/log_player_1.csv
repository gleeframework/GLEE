"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a small share to get us started.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but still be generous to you. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation, my gain of $6,000 is worth 80% of $8,000, which is $6,400.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
