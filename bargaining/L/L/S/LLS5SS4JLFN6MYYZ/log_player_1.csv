Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start with, and see how it goes from here!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer."

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, let's see if you'll take it! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not too thrilled about Bob's offer. I was hoping for a better split, especially considering the money is worth less now due to inflation. I'll reject this offer and hope to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the value of the money is decreasing. Let's see if you'll take this offer!""}

I'm trying to make a more competitive offer, taking into account the decreasing value of the money. I'm hoping Bob will consider this a fair compromise."

# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm not giving up yet! Let's see if you'll take this one! 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not impressed with Bob's offer again. The money is decreasing in value rapidly, and I'm not willing to accept a split that's still heavily skewed in his favor. I'll reject this offer and hope to do better in the next round."
