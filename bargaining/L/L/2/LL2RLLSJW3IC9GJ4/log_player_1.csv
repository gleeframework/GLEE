"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable""}\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, which I think is a reasonable starting point for negotiations. The message ""Let's be reasonable"" is a gentle nudge to Bob to consider the offer seriously and avoid unnecessary back-and-forth, which would lead to a loss of value due to inflation. By framing the offer in this way, I'm attempting to set a tone for the negotiation that prioritizes finding a mutually acceptable agreement quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, but let's wrap this up. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, despite the inflation, I believe I can negotiate a better deal. Considering the original amount and the impact of inflation, I still value the money significantly, and a 55-45 split doesn't seem generous enough given my initial offer was only slightly more favorable to me. By rejecting, I aim to push Bob to consider an even split or something closer to it, especially since he's also losing value due to inflation, albeit at a slower rate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 520000, ""bob_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""Meeting in the middle""}\n\nConsidering the effects of inflation and Bob's last offer, I'm now proposing a 52-48 split in my favor. This offer shows that I'm willing to compromise and move closer to an even split, acknowledging the loss of value over the rounds. The message ""Meeting in the middle"" conveys my intent to find a mutually acceptable midpoint between our previous offers, encouraging Bob to consider this as a fair and reasonable conclusion to our negotiation."
