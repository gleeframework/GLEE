"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair deal, Bob. I'll take the lion's share, but you get something too. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not satisfied with getting only 10% of the total amount. I think I can get a better deal if I propose a different split. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll try to make a more balanced offer and see how Alice reacts. Since the money is worth 20% less to her in each subsequent round, I might have some leverage to negotiate a better deal.

{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, Alice. This way, we both get a decent share.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 60/40 this time. I'm not sure how much longer we can keep going with this inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlthough Alice has increased her offer, I still think I can negotiate for a larger share. Given that the money is worth less to her with each passing round, I'm hoping she'll be more willing to compromise in the next round to avoid further losses due to inflation. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","With the inflation affecting Alice's gains, I'm going to try and make an offer that takes that into account. Since the money is worth less to her, she might be more inclined to accept a deal that gives me a larger share.

{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a fair offer. You're still getting a decent amount, and we can both walk away with something.""}"
