Since the money is worth less with each passing round, I'm adjusting my offer to reflect this. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a more reasonable proposal and accept it.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know if Bob accepts or makes a counteroffer. I'm ready for the next step."

As the rounds progress, the value of the money continues to decrease, and I'm hoping Bob will see the urgency in reaching an agreement soon. This offer still gives me a slightly larger share, but I'm trying to find a middle ground that Bob might find acceptable.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know if Bob accepts or makes a counteroffer.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the fairest option.  Inflation is hurting us both - let's settle this now. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI'll accept Bob's offer of a 50/50 split. Given the significant impact of inflation on the value of the money, I believe this is a fair and reasonable offer. At this point, the difference in the value of our gains due to inflation is substantial, and continuing to negotiate may not yield a better outcome. It's time to settle and secure the remaining value.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know the final outcome. I'm ready to conclude the game."
