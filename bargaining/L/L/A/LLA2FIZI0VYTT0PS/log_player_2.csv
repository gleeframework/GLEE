Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting us nowhere. I'm willing to compromise, but 60/40 in your favor is just not fair considering the inflation difference. How about we meet in the middle? 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
