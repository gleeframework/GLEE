"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly, considering the inflation risk""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, Alice proposes to take 60% of the money ($600,000) and leave 40% ($400,000) for Bob. The message suggests that the division is fair, taking into account the inflation risk that affects Alice but not Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this split is more fair, considering the inflation risk.  Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not accepting this offer because I think I can get a better deal in the next round. Although the inflation risk is a concern, I'm willing to take the risk to try to get a larger share of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a reasonable compromise.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I propose to take 55% of the money ($550,000) and leave 45% ($450,000) for Bob. The message suggests that this division is a reasonable compromise, given the inflation risk that I'm facing. Since the money is worth 10% less to me with each passing round, I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share than I initially proposed in Round 1."
