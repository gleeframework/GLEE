"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, it's a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to split the $100 equally between us, with each of us getting $50. This is a straightforward and fair proposal to begin with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, but I want a better deal next time 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so I'll consider the offer in terms of the reduced value.

Since Bob is offering me $40, which is worth 90% of $44.44 (40/0.9), I'll accept this offer.
