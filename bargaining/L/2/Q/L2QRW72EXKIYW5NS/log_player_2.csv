"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","```json

While $1000 is something, it's a very small share of the total.  I'm going to see if I can get a better deal.  Let's see what Alice proposes next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 50/50 split.  This seems fair and ensures we both get a decent amount of the money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2800 
# Alice gain: 7200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still pretty bad, even with the inflation factor.  I'm going to see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000}
```

I'm still aiming for a reasonably fair split.  I'll offer 4000 for me, and 6000 for Alice.  This should be a decent deal for both of us."
