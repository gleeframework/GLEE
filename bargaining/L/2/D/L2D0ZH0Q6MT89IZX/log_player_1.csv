"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, it's a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets the remaining 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bigger share, but I want to get a bit more myself too 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my expectations. Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not satisfied with the 30% share for myself, especially since the money is worth less than it was in the first round. I'll wait for Bob's next offer, hoping to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20, ""message"": ""I'll give you a smaller share, but I think it's a fair compromise""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the remaining $100, which is $80, and Bob gets the remaining 20%, which is $20."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I'm not willing to give up too much 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is taking a toll!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll re-evaluate Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I'll have to be more cautious with my decision. However, 75% is a decent share, and I'm willing to take it. I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept Bob's offer, hoping that this is the best I can get in this game."
