"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a moderate offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""bob_gain"": 6000
}
```

This way, we both get a significant amount, and I get a slight edge. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's proposal. With the money being worth 10% less, I'd rather get a higher share now to make up for the decrease in value.

I'll reject Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With the money being worth 10% less again, I'll try to get a better deal. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

This way, I'll get a slightly larger share, but still leave room for Bob to accept."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth significantly less now! With the reduced value, I'll try to get as much as I can. Bob's offer is still a bit too skewed towards him, but I'll consider it.

I'll reject Bob's offer.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
