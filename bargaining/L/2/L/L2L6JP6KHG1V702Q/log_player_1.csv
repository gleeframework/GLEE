# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent share, but I want more for myself! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the uneven split, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.
