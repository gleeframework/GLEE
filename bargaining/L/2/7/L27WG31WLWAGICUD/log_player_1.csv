I propose taking 90% of the money, leaving Bob with 10%. This should be a fair starting point, considering the potential inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  While the inflation rate is hurting us both, I believe this is a reasonable offer, given Bob's aggressive 70/30 split in the previous round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is starting to really hurt. A 45/55 split is better than losing more money to inflation in future rounds."
