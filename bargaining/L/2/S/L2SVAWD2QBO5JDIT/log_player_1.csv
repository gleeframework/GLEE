"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. The message is a bit aggressive, but I'm trying to get a good deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, Alice! Let's split it more fairly! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is a bit more generous, but I'm not sure I want to give up that much.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and try to do better in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth 20% less now, so I need to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 720000,
  ""bob_gain"": 280000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $280,000 and keeping $720,000 for myself. Let's see if he'll accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Getting closer, but I still think I deserve more! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value rapidly! I need to be careful.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. $450,000 is better than nothing, and I don't want to risk going into negative value territory. Time to cut my losses!"
