Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You should've taken my first offer 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000

Round 4

""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, the effects of inflation are severe. While ideally, I'd want a more equitable split, taking the offer gives me $300,000. Rejecting it means I risk getting even less in the next round, with the value of my potential gains significantly diminished.  It's a gamble I don't think is worth taking at this stage.
