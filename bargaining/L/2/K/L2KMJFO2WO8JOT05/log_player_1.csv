"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

I'm starting with a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can avoid the inflation that's coming our way!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already biting!

I'll think carefully... With Bob's offer, I'd be getting $40, which is worth 5% less than my original 50, but Bob's $60 is worth 20% less than his original 50. This means I'm losing more value than Bob is.

I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the inflation.

Since the money is worth less now, I'll aim for a higher percentage for myself to compensate. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```"

Round 4

Bob's offer:

# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll!

Let's calculate the actual values Bob is offering:

My gain: $30, which is worth 30% of the original $100, considering the 14.26% decrease.
Bob's gain: $70, which is worth 70% of the original $100, considering the 48.8% decrease.

Considering the significant decrease in value, I'll think carefully... I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal. I'll reject this offer.
