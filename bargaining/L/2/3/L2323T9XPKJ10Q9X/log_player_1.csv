"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you 40% of the total.""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game on a good note."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fairer, considering we both lose value with each round. Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the value of money decreasing, I need to be more cautious. Bob's offer is a bit more favorable to him, but it's still a decent split. I'll consider it. 

I'll reject the offer for now, hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In the next round, the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the previous round, so I need to adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5400,
  ""bob_gain"": 4600,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. This split is a bit more in your favor, but I think it's fair given the circumstances.""
}
```"
