Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're feeling the inflation more than I am. How about a 55/45 split? It's a fair deal considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
