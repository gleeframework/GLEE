Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take 60 and you get 40""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."

# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take a bit more. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's proposal, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to be more cautious with my decision.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a bit aggressive, I'll try to counter with a more balanced proposal. Here's my offer:

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, trying to find a more reasonable compromise."
