This is my first offer. I am taking the lion's share, but leaving a little bit for Bob. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1900 
# Bob gain: 8100 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm not satisfied with this offer. It's a significant drop from my initial proposal, and I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm lowering my initial offer slightly to make it more appealing to Bob, but I'm still taking the majority. I'm hoping he'll accept this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3439 
# Bob gain: 6561 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While this offer is significantly better than the previous round, I'm still hoping to get a larger share.  I'll keep pushing for a better deal."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm further lowering my offer to try and incentivize Bob to accept, but I'm still taking a large share. We're running out of rounds, so I'm hoping this will be enough."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4686 
# Bob gain: 5314 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Although this offer is considerably less than my initial goal, the inflation has drastically reduced the value of the money, and with only 6 rounds remaining, I need to secure some funds. This is the best deal I'm likely to get at this point."
