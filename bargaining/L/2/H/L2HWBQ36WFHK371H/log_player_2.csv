Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want a good deal. Let's stop wasting time with the back and forth. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both benefit before inflation eats away at the value. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000
