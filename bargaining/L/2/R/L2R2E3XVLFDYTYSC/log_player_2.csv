Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but you're losing money rapidly!  This is my last offer above 70%. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage. While the offer is better than the previous one, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. I need to show her I'm serious about getting a reasonable share, even if it means getting closer to the deadline."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 400000,
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer. 40/60 split. It's a fair deal considering the time constraint and the inflation working against me. Take it or leave it.""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Resolve:**  Alice needs to see that I'm serious about getting a reasonable share. By presenting this as my ""final offer,"" I'm increasing the pressure.
* **Balance:**  The 40/60 split, while not ideal, is a significant jump from my previous 50/50 offer.  It shows a willingness to negotiate but also sets a firm boundary.
* **Time Sensitivity:**  With only six rounds left, the inflation is becoming a major factor. I need to push for a resolution before my bargaining power erodes further."
