I'm proposing a division of 999,000$ for me and 1,000$ for Bob. This is a very high offer in my favor, but I want to see if he's willing to accept it in the first round.  Let's see if he's greedy or wants to play the long game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, considering inflation and the possibility of getting nothing if we reach the 12th round, accepting a 50/50 split is the best option for me right now."
