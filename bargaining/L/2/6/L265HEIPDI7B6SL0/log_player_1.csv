"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 evenly, with each of us getting $5,000. This is a straightforward and fair proposal, and I hope Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but still a bit more for me 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth 5% less for me this round, I'll have to think carefully about it.

For now, I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60/40, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's closer to 50/50. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""A slight adjustment to get closer to 50/50, let's see if you'll accept this one!""}

I'm willing to give Bob a slightly larger share, hoping he'll meet me in the middle."
