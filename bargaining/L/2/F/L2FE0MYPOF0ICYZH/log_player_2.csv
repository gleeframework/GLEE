"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, but I'm also aware of the inflation. Let's split it 90/10. I'll take the bigger share, but I'll let you keep a decent amount. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see if I can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering the inflation that will affect both of us in the next round.  Let's be reasonable and end this game.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be pragmatic.  The inflation is biting both of us now. This 70/30 split ensures we both get a decent amount before it gets much worse. Let's end this game. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While a 70/30 split isn't ideal, the inflation is getting out of hand. It's better to accept and secure something now before it gets worse."
