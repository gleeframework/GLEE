Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better.  I'm offering you $400,000, which is still a good deal considering the inflation we'll face in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000
