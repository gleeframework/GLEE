"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. I'll take 80% and leave you with 20%. You can do better than this?""
}
```

I'm starting with a relatively generous offer, but I'm sure Bob will try to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit less than 30%, can you accept this offer? 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but the money Bob gains is worth 20% less, I need to adjust my valuation of the offer.

With inflation, Bob's offer is equivalent to:

Alice gain: 300000 / 0.8 = 375000
Bob gain: 700000

I can do better than this, but it's a decent offer. I'll reject it and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit less than 40%, can you accept this offer?""
}
```

My counteroffer is to take 40% of the original 1,000,000, which is equivalent to 400000."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give away the farm. Take it or leave it?""
}
```

I've increased my offer to 42% of the original 1,000,000, which is a bit more generous than my previous counteroffer."
