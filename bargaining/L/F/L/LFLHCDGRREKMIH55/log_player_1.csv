I'm going to propose a very uneven split. I want to maximize my share in the first round to take advantage of the inflation. This way, even if Bob rejects my offer, I'll still have a higher share in the next round due to the devaluation of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While it's a painful outcome to get such a small share, accepting this offer is the best strategy. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  My share is already drastically reduced due to inflation. If I reject and make a counter-offer, the money will be worth even less in the next round, potentially making it impossible to get a decent share.
* **Bob's Leverage:** Bob has demonstrated he's willing to take a large share, and he's likely to continue this pattern. Rejecting him risks another unfavorable offer or even worse, a potential scenario where he takes almost everything in the final round.

It's better to take a small amount now than risk getting nothing in the future."
