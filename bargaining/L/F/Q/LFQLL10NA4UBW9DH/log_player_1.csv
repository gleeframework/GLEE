"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to offer Bob a very small amount. I want to see if he's willing to accept a tiny share, or if he'll try to negotiate for more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is fair, and the potential for more gains in the future is outweighed by the risk of inflation. It's best to accept the 50/50 split."
