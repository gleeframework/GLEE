Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Alice's offer was 70/30, I'll try to counter with a similar ratio. However, I'll take a slightly larger share to account for the inflation.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is affecting me more than Alice! Given the reduced value of the money, I'll take a smaller share to maximize my gain in real terms. However, I notice that Alice is proposing a 50/50 split, which is a significant change from her previous offer. I'll accept this offer.
