"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer aims to secure a large portion of the money while leaving Bob with a small amount. I am hoping that Bob will accept, as even a small amount is better than nothing.  However, I'm also considering the potential impact of inflation.  If Bob rejects the offer, I will have to account for the reduced value of the money in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While this offer is significantly less favorable than my initial proposal, it's still better than nothing.  The inflation factor is a major consideration, and accepting this offer ensures I receive at least some of the money.  It's a gamble, but it's the best strategy given the circumstances."
