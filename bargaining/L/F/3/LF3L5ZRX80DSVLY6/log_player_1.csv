"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm proposing that I get $70 and Bob gets $30."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth 20% less for me, I'll have to adjust my valuation of the offer accordingly. If I accept this offer, I'll be getting 45 dollars, but its value is actually 45 / 0.8 = 56.25 dollars in the original terms.

I'll decide to reject this offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","With the money worth 20% less again, my proposal for Round 3 is:

```
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping to get a fair deal and move closer to dividing the money."
