"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'm offering Bob 40% of the money, which I think is a generous offer considering the money is worth less to him with each passing round. I'm hoping he'll accept this offer and we can end the game quickly.\n\nYour turn! What does Bob say?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we should split it evenly, let's be fair. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting this offer because I think I can get a better deal. Since the money is worth 5% less to Bob with each passing round, I can try to negotiate for a larger share. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round.\n\nLet's proceed to the next round! What's the updated situation?"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\nI'm offering Bob 42% of the money, which is a slight decrease from my previous offer. Since the money is worth less to Bob with each passing round, I'm hoping he'll be more willing to accept this offer. I'm framing it as a compromise, suggesting that we ""meet in the middle"" between our previous offers.\n\nYour turn! What does Bob say?"
