"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start off strong. I take $70, you take $30.  It's in your best interest to settle early, as the money loses value quickly for you. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
It's too early to accept such a lopsided offer. I'll see what Alice offers next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think 60/40 is a fairer split, considering the value of the money decreases faster for me. Let's settle this now.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the situation is disadvantageous for you, but 60/40 is too low for me. How about $75 for me and $25 for you? This is your last chance for a decent payout. 
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While the offer is better than the first round, it's still a very unequal split. I'll try to negotiate a fairer deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""We are both losing money with each passing round. Let's split it evenly and avoid further losses. 50/50 is the only fair solution at this point.""}
```"
