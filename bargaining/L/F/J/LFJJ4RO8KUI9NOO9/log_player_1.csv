"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving us both $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share this round, but still willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with the 75/25 split, and I think Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a bigger share. I'll reject this offer and hope to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4000, ""bob_gain"": 6000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly bigger share this round, but I still want to keep some buffer for myself""}

I'm proposing a 40/60 split, giving Bob a slightly bigger share than before, but still keeping a decent amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise further, but I think this is a fairer split considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I think Bob's offer is a reasonable compromise considering the inflation. The 45/55 split is closer to a 50/50 split than before, and I'm willing to accept it to avoid further negotiations."
