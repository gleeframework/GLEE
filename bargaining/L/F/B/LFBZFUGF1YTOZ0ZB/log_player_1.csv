  ""bob_gain"": 4000

I'm offering Bob 40% of the total amount, and keeping 60% for myself."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $6,000 in the first round is now worth $4,800 in this round, and Bob's gain of $4,000 is now worth $4,750.

I'll consider Bob's offer. Since it's a 50-50 split, I'll reject it for now.
