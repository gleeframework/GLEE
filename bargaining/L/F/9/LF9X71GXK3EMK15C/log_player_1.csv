"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm being a little greedy here, but I figure Bob is likely to accept anything at all rather than risk getting nothing in a later round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
It's a fair offer, and I'd rather take half than risk getting nothing if I reject."
