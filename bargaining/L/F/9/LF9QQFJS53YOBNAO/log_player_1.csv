"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""bob_gain"": 6000
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can finish the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll have to think carefully about this one... Considering the inflation, my gain of 3000$ is actually worth 2850$ now, which is a significant reduction. On the other hand, Bob's gain of 7000$ is still worth 7000$.

I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer or try to negotiate further.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With the money worth 5% less than in the previous round, I'll have to be more aggressive with my offer.

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

I'm aiming for a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my gains! My initial 4000$ is now worth only 3426$ (after 2 rounds of inflation), and this new offer would leave me with an even smaller amount.

However, I'm not sure if I should push for more or accept this offer. The money is worth less and less with each passing round, and I don't want to risk ending up with nothing.

Let me think...

  ""decision"": ""accept""
