Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'm offering you $300,000, leaving me with $700,000. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small amount to start, hoping to negotiate a better deal later on."

# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but still a good deal. Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll have to be more cautious with my decisions.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better. I'll wait for his next offer to see if he'll give me a better deal."

  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You're being a bit stingy, Bob! I'll give you a slightly smaller share this time. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm trying to make a slightly more aggressive offer, but still leaving room for negotiation."

# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value rapidly! With the money being worth 48.8% less for me and 27.1% less for Bob, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better. Meeting halfway might be a good deal for Bob, but I'm hoping to get a better split. I'll wait for his next offer to see if he'll give me a better deal."

  ""message"": ""I'm not afraid to take a risk! I'll give you the majority of the money this time. Will you take it?""
}
```

I'm making a bold move, offering Bob the majority of the money. I'm hoping he'll take it, but I'm also prepared for him to reject it and make a counteroffer."
