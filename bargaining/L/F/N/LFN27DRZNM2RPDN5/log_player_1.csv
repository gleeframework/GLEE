"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted a fair split, but I think I'm worth more! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of the situation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think I'm worth 70% of what I was worth in the first round, so I'll reject this offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

  ""message"": ""You're overestimating your worth, Bob! Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to try to meet Bob in the middle, while still getting a slightly better deal for myself."

# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is still trying to get the better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
