"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, I'll give you a fair share""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40, which is a fair share, and I'll take the remaining $60."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than 40-60. Let's split it 60-40, with me getting the bigger share this time. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 40 * 0.8 = 32
* Bob gain: 60 * 0.8 = 48

I don't think this offer is fair, considering the inflation. I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50-50, we can both get an equal share""
}
```

I'm offering a 50-50 split, which seems fair considering the decreasing value of money due to inflation."
