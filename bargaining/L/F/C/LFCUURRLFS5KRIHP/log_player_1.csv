"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}
```

This offer is a risky gamble. I am taking a large chunk of the money, but it's important to remember that if Bob rejects, I risk losing a lot of money due to inflation. However, I am confident that Bob will accept, as even a small amount of money is better than nothing for him in the later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer to have more, accepting this offer is the most logical choice.  Considering the inflation, my share would decrease significantly if I were to reject and propose a new offer in the next round. This offer guarantees me a substantial amount, and it's unlikely Bob would offer me more in the future rounds."
