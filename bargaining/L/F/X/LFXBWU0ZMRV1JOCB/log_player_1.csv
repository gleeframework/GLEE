This offer gives me a slightly larger share of the money, but I'm willing to compromise. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is worse for me than my original offer, and I'm confident I can get a better deal. I'll reject and see what he offers next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

I'm going to stick with a similar split as my first offer, but slightly adjust it to account for the inflation. Let's see if Bob will accept this time."
