{""bob_gain"": 75, ""alice_gain"": 25, ""message"": ""I propose a 75/25 split in my favor.  Since you rejected my previous offer, I'm confident in my position this round.  Remember, the value of your money decreases by 10% each round, so you're better off accepting this deal.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the decreasing value of money, I propose a 60/40 split in our favor. This is a fair compromise given the inflationary context. Remember, each round the value of your money decreases by 10%. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
