"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can adjust in future rounds""
}
```

I'm proposing that I receive $8,000 and Bob receives $2,000. This is a relatively even split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a 50/50 split, no need to overthink it 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob, the actual amounts are:

My gain: 5000 / 0.8 = 6250 (due to 20% less value)
Bob's gain: 5000 / 0.9 = 5555.56 (due to 10% less value)

I'll accept Bob's offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
