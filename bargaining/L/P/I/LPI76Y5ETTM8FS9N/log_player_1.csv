"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you 400k and keep 600k. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm starting with a 60/40 split in my favor, but I'm open to negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but you're still getting less than half. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is biting!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since Bob is offering me $300,000, but it's worth 10% less than the $400,000 I was initially offered, I'm actually getting $360,000 in real terms.

However, Bob is getting $700,000, which is worth 5% less than the $735,000 he would have gotten in the first round, so he's actually getting $697,500 in real terms.

I'm not thrilled about this deal, but I don't want to keep playing if I can get a better offer. I'll decide to accept this offer for now.
