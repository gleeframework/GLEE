Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger share to compensate for the inflation hitting me harder. Let's call it 70/30. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is taking advantage of the situation, but her offer isn't drastically better than my last one, considering her losses to inflation. I need to push for a more significant change in the next round."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're both losing money with each round.  Let's meet in the middle at 65/35. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

Alice is holding firm, and while it's not the 55/45 I wanted, accepting now is better than risking getting a worse deal or nothing at all in later rounds."
