"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI am offering Bob 40% of the money and keeping 60% for myself. Since I am the first to make an offer, I am trying to be generous while still keeping a larger share for myself. I hope Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest way, and we can both avoid any future disagreements. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nWhile Bob's offer seems fair at first glance, considering the inflation, the actual value of the money has decreased. Since I initially offered Bob 40% and he rejected it, I believe I can negotiate for a better deal. I'll reject this offer and try to get a more favorable outcome in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I will make an offer that is slightly more favorable to Bob than my initial offer, but still takes into account the decreased value of the money due to inflation. I'll offer Bob 450,000, which is 45% of the original amount, and keep 550,000 for myself.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's compromise""}\n\nI hope this offer is more acceptable to Bob, and we can conclude the game with this proposal."
