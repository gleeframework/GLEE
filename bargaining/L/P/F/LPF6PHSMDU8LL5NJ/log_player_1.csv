"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}

Let's see how fair Bob thinks this offer is.  I'll propose a 90/10 split in my favor, leaving him with a smaller share.  Let's see if he's willing to accept it in the first round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, with the inflation factor and the risk of getting nothing, accepting this offer seems like the best choice. It's a significant gain for me, and the risk of getting nothing in future rounds is too high."
