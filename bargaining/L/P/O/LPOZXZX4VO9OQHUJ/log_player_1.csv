Let's see if Bob is greedy or reasonable!  I'm offering him a small share to start, but I want to keep the lion's share for myself.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

# Bob gain: 810000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a terrible deal! Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I'm not going to let him get away with it. I'll counter with a better offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}

I'm still aiming for a large share, but I'm willing to compromise a bit to avoid getting nothing. I'm offering Bob a decent share, but I'm keeping the majority for myself.  Let's see if he accepts!"

Bob is still being greedy!  He's trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I'm not going to let him get away with it. I'll try to offer a fair deal in the next round, but I'm not going to give up the majority of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm still trying to keep the majority of the money, but I'm adjusting my offer to make it more reasonable.  I'm offering Bob a larger share this time, but I'm still holding out for the lion's share.  I need to find a balance between securing a decent share for myself and avoiding another rejection."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 468559 
# Bob gain: 531441

{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a tough one. The inflation is really starting to hurt, and I don't want to risk getting nothing.  Even though Bob is still getting a bigger share than I would prefer, at least I'm getting something. I'll accept his offer."
