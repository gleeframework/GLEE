"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}

I'm going to start with a very aggressive offer. This is risky, but I want to see if I can get a quick win. Since there's inflation, getting even a small amount of money early is better than waiting for later rounds and risking losing more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get more, it's better to accept this offer than risk getting less in the future rounds due to inflation."
