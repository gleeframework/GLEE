Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

Although not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most logical decision at this point. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  The longer the game goes on, the less Bob's share is worth to him due to the 20% inflation.  This weakens his bargaining position. However, it doesn't benefit me to drag it out as my amount stays the same.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Rejecting this offer and hoping for a better deal in Round 5 is very risky. Bob's share will be worth even less, making it less likely he'll offer anything close to what I want. There's a real chance the negotiations could completely break down, leaving us both with nothing. 

A 50/50 split isn't ideal for me considering the inflation disadvantage Bob faces, but it guarantees a reasonable payout."
