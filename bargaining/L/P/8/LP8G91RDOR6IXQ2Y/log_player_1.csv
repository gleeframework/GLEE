"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, 60% for me and 40% for you.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting 6,000 and Bob getting 4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly.  This way, we both get a good amount, and we don't have to worry about inflation eating away at our gains. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not sure I want to accept an even split, as I was hoping to get a slightly better deal. But Bob's message does make sense, and 5,000 is a decent amount.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now.
