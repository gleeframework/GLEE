"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 51/49 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering the potential for inflation, and allows us both to receive a significant share of the money. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","{
