  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 90-10, I'll get the lion's share, but you'll get a decent chunk too. What do you say?""

# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's proposal.

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is getting more aggressive!

```

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to pressure me into accepting!
