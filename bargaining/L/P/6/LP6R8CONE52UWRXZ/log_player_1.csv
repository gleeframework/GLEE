"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you $100,000 and take the rest. We can negotiate further if you'd like.""
}
```

This offer gives me a significant majority of the money, but still leaves Bob with a decent amount to start with. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good starting point. Let's see if we can improve it from here. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $200,000 is now worth $190,000, and Bob's gain of $800,000 is worth $720,000. This is a good offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 5% less than in the previous round, my offer is now:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 180000,
  ""bob_gain"": 820000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm still willing to compromise. Let's see if we can find a better deal.""
}
```

This offer reflects the reduced value of the money due to inflation, and I'm hoping Bob will be willing to accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think I deserve more. Let's see if you're willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $100,000 is now worth $86,000. I'm not sure if I'm willing to accept this offer, as I'm not getting a very significant share of the money.

However, I'm not sure if I can do better, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with even lower value money. I'll accept this offer.
