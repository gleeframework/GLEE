"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm starting with a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a fair initial offer, considering the inflation factors."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though I'm getting less than my initial proposal, it's still better to accept this offer. Inflation would significantly decrease the value of the money if we keep rejecting offers and going to the next round."
