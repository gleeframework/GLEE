"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering you $40, and I'll take $60."

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 47.5 
# Bob gain: 52.5 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less for Bob, he's trying to get a bigger share. I'll consider his offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer was 52.5 for him and 47.5 for me, I'll try to adjust my offer to get a better deal. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm offering a 50-50 split, hoping to get a better deal than the previous offers."
