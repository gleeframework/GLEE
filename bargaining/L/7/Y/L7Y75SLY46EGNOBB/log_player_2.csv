Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting closer, but I still want a bit more 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the faster inflation on my end. While the gap is closing, accepting now would still give her a significantly larger share. I need to show I'm serious about getting a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Look, this is getting ridiculous.  A 50/50 split is the only fair option at this point. Take it or leave it.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The longer this goes on, the more we both lose. By round 6, the inflation is significantly impacting both sides.  A 50/50 split, while not ideal at this point, prevents further losses and demonstrates seriousness about reaching an agreement.  It's a firm but fair offer under the circumstances."
