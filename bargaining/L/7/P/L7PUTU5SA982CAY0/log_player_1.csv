"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, it's a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, hoping to set a good tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but still a fair offer 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to be more cautious. Bob's offer is a bit more aggressive, but I'll consider it. I'll accept this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
