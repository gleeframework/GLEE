"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $800,000 and Bob gets $200,000. I'm starting with a fair split, and I'm hoping Bob will be reasonable and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm not going to give away too much 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't want to give Bob the majority of the money, but I also don't want to wait for another round and lose more value to inflation. I'll accept this offer.
