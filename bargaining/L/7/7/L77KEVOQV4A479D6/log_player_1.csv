Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise with a 70/30 split, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share considering the decreasing value of money. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
