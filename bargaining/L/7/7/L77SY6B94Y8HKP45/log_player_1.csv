  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need for further negotiation""

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round. Considering Bob's offer, I'd rather not take the smaller share. I'll reject the offer and make a counter-proposal.
