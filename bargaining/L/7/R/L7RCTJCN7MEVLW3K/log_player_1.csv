"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a proposal that favors me slightly.  I want to see if Bob is willing to accept a small share.  We can then adjust the offer in the next round if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Even with the 5% inflation, taking 400,000 is better than waiting for another round and risking getting even less."
