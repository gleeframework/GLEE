Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5250,
""alice_gain"": 4750,
""message"": ""Your turn, Alice. I think a 50/50 split would be the fairest, but given the inflation, I need a bit extra this round to make it worthwhile. This offer is fair and lets us both leave with something substantial.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my offer is more generous than before. Take it before the money loses more value for you. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 
 
While Alice's offer is framed as generous, it's important to remember that the value of the money is decreasing significantly for me with each round. Holding out for a better offer in the next round is still the better strategy, even if it means accepting slightly less than 4200 then."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. The value for me is dropping fast. This is my final offer where I get a slight majority to offset the inflation. If you decline, I'm likely to accept any future offer where I get more than 4000, regardless of how much the total has shrunk.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said you'd accept anything above 4000. This is my final offer, and it's more than fair considering the inflation has only affected your share. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice is right. I did say I'd accept anything above 4000.  While I'd prefer more, my bargaining power has significantly weakened. Accepting now is the best way to guarantee I receive something reasonable before the value diminishes further."
