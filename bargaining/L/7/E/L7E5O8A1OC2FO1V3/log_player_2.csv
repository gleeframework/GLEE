"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Alice, the total value of the money is now 90% of the original value.

I'll make an offer to divide the money as follows:
{""bob_gain"": 40, ""alice_gain"": 60}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 39 
# Alice gain: 61 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the decreasing value of the money, I'll think carefully about Alice's offer.
