"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a good base""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a fair starting point. Let's see if Bob agrees!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, no more negotiations! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about the 50-50 split, especially since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation. I think I can do better than that. I'll reject this offer and hope to get a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Compromise on a slightly better split, but still fair""}

I'm adjusting my proposal to give myself a slightly larger share, but still leaving some room for Bob to negotiate. Let's see if he's willing to meet me halfway!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give a bit more, but don't want to give up too much 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Considering the effects of inflation, I'm not thrilled about the decreasing value of the money, but Bob's offer is still a decent one. I think I can live with a 52-48 split, especially since Bob is willing to give a bit more. I'll accept this offer and wrap up the game!"
