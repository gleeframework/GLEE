"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is a generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it quickly so we can avoid the effects of inflation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the previous round, I'll think about it carefully...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not quite ready to accept this offer yet!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the 10% total decrease in value due to inflation so far.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000
}
```

This offer is a bit more aggressive, but I'm hoping Bob will be willing to accept it before the value of the money continues to erode!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of my potential gain!

I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth significantly less than in the first round, I'm inclined to accept this offer to avoid further losses.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the offer and hope it's the best decision given the circumstances!"
