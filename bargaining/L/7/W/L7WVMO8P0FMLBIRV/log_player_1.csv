Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you starting us off, Alice. How about a 60/40 split? It benefits us both to agree sooner rather than later due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
