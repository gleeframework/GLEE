"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This offer is a starting point. I propose a 60/40 split, favoring me slightly. I believe it's fair given that the money is worth more to me in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting a 50/50 split in round 2 is a good outcome. The inflation rate would make any further negotiation risky, and it's likely Bob will propose an even less favorable split in the next round."
