"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money equally. It's fair and simple. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm going to reject the offer.  While it's a fair split, there's no incentive for me to accept in the first round.  I want to see if I can get a better deal for myself.  Since I don't know how inflation affects Alice, I want to see if I can use that to my advantage."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I propose we split the money 60/40 in my favor. This allows for a bit more room for negotiation in future rounds, and gives us both a good start.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I believe a 60/40 split would be more equitable considering the inflation factor. Let's aim for a balanced distribution. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice's offer is a good compromise.  While I prefer the 60/40 split in my favor, I don't want to risk losing everything by continuing to play.  Accepting this offer guarantees me a significant portion of the money and avoids the risk of inflation."
