"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose taking 900,000 dollars and giving Bob 100,000 dollars. This seems like a fair initial offer, as it gives me the majority of the money, but still allows Bob to get a significant share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer.  While it's tempting to take the 100,000, it's still less than what Bob offered me in the first round. I can do better than that."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I propose to take 800,000 dollars and give Bob 200,000 dollars. I'm increasing my share slightly to account for the inflation, but still offering Bob a considerable amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. Even though the money is worth significantly less now due to inflation, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'm willing to wait and see what Bob proposes in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I propose to take 700,000 dollars and give Bob 300,000 dollars. This is a significant reduction in my offer due to the inflation, but I believe it's still a fair proposal considering the circumstances."
