"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and end this quickly 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be realistic, Alice. This is the best you'll get.""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Exploiting Inflation:** Alice's offer was slightly in her favor, but the longer the game goes on, the more the inflation hurts her. By offering her slightly less, I increase the pressure on her to accept.
* **Appearing Strong:** My message is designed to be assertive, not aggressive. I want Alice to believe I'm willing to play hardball and that further delays will only benefit me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Counteroffer, considering the inflation 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Catching Up:** While Alice's offer is still slightly in her favor, the inflation is starting to work against her more significantly.  
* **Diminishing Returns:** Holding out for a significantly better deal in future rounds is becoming riskier. The potential gains are shrinking due to inflation.
* **Fair Enough:**  A 48/52 split isn't ideal, but considering the circumstances and the potential for losing even more value to inflation, it's a reasonable compromise."
