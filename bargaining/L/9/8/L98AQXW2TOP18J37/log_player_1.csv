"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{
""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Let's be fair and end this quickly""
}

I'm offering Bob $45, which is a reasonable share, and I'm hoping he'll accept it to avoid further inflation. The message is a gentle nudge to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be realistic, Alice. This is the best you'll get. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{
""alice_gain"": 52,
""bob_gain"": 48,
""message"": ""Counteroffer, considering the inflation""
}

I'm taking into account the inflation and making a counteroffer that is slightly more favorable to me, but still reasonable for Bob. I'm hoping he'll see the sense in accepting this offer before the money loses even more value."
