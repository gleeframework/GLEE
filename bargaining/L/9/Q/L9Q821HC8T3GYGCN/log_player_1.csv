"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 

This is a classic game theory problem! I'm going to start by offering Bob a small amount, hoping to get the game over quickly and avoid the effects of inflation.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being a little greedy! I'm going to reject this offer.  Even though the money is worth less now, I'm hoping that by rejecting, I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly, hoping to incentivize Bob to accept.  Let's see if this is enough!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still being too greedy!  Even though the money is worth less now, I'm still hoping to get a better deal. I'll reject his offer and try to make a more favorable proposal next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}
```

I'm going to increase my offer again, but not by much. I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent amount of money and avoiding further rounds where the inflation will significantly impact the value of my gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While I'm starting to feel the effects of inflation, I'm still not ready to accept such a low offer. I believe I can still get a better deal, especially considering the inflation is affecting Bob less than me.  I'll reject and try to get a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm going to increase my offer again, hoping to reach a compromise.  The inflation is starting to hurt, but I think I can still get a decent deal if I play my cards right."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I've been rejecting Bob's offers for a while now, but inflation is really starting to hurt.  We're down to the wire, and there's a chance we might get nothing if we keep rejecting each other. It's time to cut my losses and accept a 50/50 split. At least I'll get something!"
