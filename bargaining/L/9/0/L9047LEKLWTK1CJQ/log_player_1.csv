"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose a 900,000 to 100,000 split in my favor.  I figure this is a good starting point, as it leaves a significant amount for Bob while still giving me a substantial portion.  Let's see what he thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject this offer. While I understand the effects of inflation, a 100,000 to 900,000 split is simply unacceptable. I'm willing to negotiate, but a 10% share is too low."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 720000, ""bob_gain"": 280000}
```

I propose a 720,000 to 280,000 split. While the inflation has impacted my share, I'm still willing to offer a good portion to Bob.  This split reflects the ongoing inflation but still offers a decent amount to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. Although the inflation has significantly reduced my share, a 200,000 to 800,000 split is simply too unfair. I'm still willing to negotiate, but a 20% share is too low."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 576000, ""bob_gain"": 424000}
```

I propose a 576,000 to 424,000 split. This offer acknowledges the significant impact of inflation, but I believe it's still a fair compromise.  I'm willing to take a smaller share to end this game, but a 40% share for Bob is the most I can offer at this point."
