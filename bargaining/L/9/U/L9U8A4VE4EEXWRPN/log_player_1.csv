"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering a 70-30 split in my favor, which is a relatively generous offer considering we're starting from a clean slate. Let's see if Bob accepts or rejects!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in Round 1. So, if I accept Bob's offer, I'll be getting $45 (50 * 0.9).

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
