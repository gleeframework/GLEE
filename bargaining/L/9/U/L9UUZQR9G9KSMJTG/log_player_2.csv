Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a larger share. Accept this, or risk losing more in the next round. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000

{""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. I'm offering a very generous 60/40 split.  The clock is ticking, and the pot is shrinking. Don't be greedy!""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer. I'm willing to take a smaller share to avoid further risk. Accept, or we both get nothing! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, the deal is getting significantly worse with each round. Accepting 400,000 is better than risking getting nothing, or even a worse deal in the later rounds.
