"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where I would get $500,000 and Bob would get $500,000."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the lead, but still a fair offer 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'm now considering a gain of $400,000 to be equivalent to a gain of $444,444.44 in the first round.

Bob's offer is still quite generous, and I'm tempted to accept. However, I'm not sure if I should give up the potential for a better offer in future rounds.

I'll decide to...

I'm proposing a slightly more generous offer, where I would get $420,000 and Bob would get $580,000. I'm trying to find a compromise that's closer to the 50/50 split we started with, while still giving Bob a slightly larger share."

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the effects of inflation are starting to bite!

Since the money I gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'm now considering a gain of $300,000 to be equivalent to a gain of $411,765.38 in the first round.

Bob's offer is getting more aggressive, and I'm not thrilled about giving up so much more. However, I'm not sure if I can do better in future rounds, and this offer is still a significant amount.

# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are really starting to hurt!

Since the money I gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round, I'm now considering a gain of $200,000 to be equivalent to a gain of $334,285.71 in the first round.

Bob's offer is getting more aggressive, and I'm really struggling to accept this. I'm not sure if I can survive on $200,000, especially considering the value of money is decreasing rapidly.

However, I'm not sure if I can do better in future rounds, and this offer is still a significant amount.
