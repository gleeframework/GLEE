"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $10,000 and Bob can take 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split in my favor is more fair, considering the inflation difference. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, I'll have to be more cautious. I don't want to accept an offer that's still biased towards Bob.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my offer will be worth less in terms of real value. I'll aim for a more balanced split this time. Here's my offer:

  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Let's aim for a 55-45 split, considering the inflation. It's a fair compromise.""
