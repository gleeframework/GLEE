"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly, considering my patience wears thin with inflation.""}\n\n###\n\nI'll offer Bob $45 and take $55 for myself, considering the impact of inflation on both of us. I'm hoping Bob will see the fairness in this division, given that his money loses value faster.\n\n###\n\nPlease respond with Bob's decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to split it more evenly, taking into account the inflation. Let's be fair. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Although he's trying to be fair, considering the inflation, I believe I can negotiate a better deal, especially since the money is losing value at different rates for us. Let's see what the next round brings.\n\n###\n\nPlease let Bob know my decision."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Considering the increasing loss from inflation, let's meet closer to the middle.""}\n\n###\n\nGiven the impact of inflation on both of our potential gains, I'm adjusting my offer to be more favorable to Bob while still considering my own loss. Hopefully, this division will be more appealing to him, as the money continues to lose value with each round.\n\n###\n\nPlease respond with Bob's decision."
