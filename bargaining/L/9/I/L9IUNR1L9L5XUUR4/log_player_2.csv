"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share, but you get a good chunk to start with. Accept and we're done, or we can go through more rounds and see how much that inflation hurts. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While the offer is tempting, it's best to see how much inflation will hurt Alice's offers in the next round.  Even if the offer doesn't increase, a rejection will give Bob control over the next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Let's split it more evenly.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bigger share than the last offer. Accept this and we're done.  Otherwise, we'll see how much inflation hurts you in the next round.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I need a larger share than your last offer. We both need to be strategic with this inflation, and this is the best deal I can offer right now.  Let's end this before it gets any worse for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While it would be nice to hold out for a bigger share, it's important to consider the inflation.  Accepting Alice's offer means I'll get a good chunk of the money, and the inflation will make it much less attractive in the next round.  It's time to take the sure thing."
