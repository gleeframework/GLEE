"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is 10% of the original amount, and keeping $900,000 for myself. The message is a bit of a challenge to Bob, hoping he'll accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $400,000 is now worth $360,000 (90% of $400,000).

I'm not sure if meeting halfway is the best strategy, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to propose a new offer, hoping to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less again, my potential gain of $400,000 is now worth $360,000 (90% of $400,000).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting closer, but I'm still the boss!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, which is 30% of the original amount, and keeping $700,000 for myself. The message is a bit of a jab to keep the pressure on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I'm still not done yet! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $300,000 is now worth $220,500 (72.9% of $300,000).

I'm not sure if Bob's offer is a good deal, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer, as it's a decent split and I don't want to risk going to the next round with even less value in my potential gain."
