Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a compromise - slightly more for you than your last offer, but still acknowledges the time pressure we both face. 
# Bob gain: 4250 
# Alice gain: 5750

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm meeting you halfway between our previous offers.  Let's settle this now and avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a tough one, and depends on your risk tolerance.  Here's why I'm leaning towards accepting:

* **Diminishing Returns:** The longer the game goes on, the less your potential gains are worth. While Alice is offering the same amount as Round 2, the inflation means it's actually less valuable to you now.
* **Time Pressure:** We're over halfway through the rounds.  Holding out hope for a significantly better deal is risky.
* **Splitting the Difference:** Alice is showing willingness to compromise, even if it's a small one.

**However, rejecting is still a valid option if:**

* **You believe Alice might crack under pressure** and offer you a better deal in later rounds. 

Ultimately, the choice is yours!"
