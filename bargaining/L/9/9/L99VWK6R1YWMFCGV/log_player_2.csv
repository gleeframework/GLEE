"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, Bob. Accept this and we can move on. 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While a 2000$ gain is tempting, it's better to see what Alice's later offers might be.  I'll reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it evenly.  This way, we both get a decent amount.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a decent chunk, but I need to prioritize my gain. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While 3000$ is something, it's still significantly less than what I could potentially get with a few more rounds. I'm holding out for a better deal, even with the inflation factor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a fair share. Let's try 6000 for me, 4000 for you. It's a good deal for both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I need to take the lead. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

With each round, the value of the money I'm gaining is decreasing significantly.  At this point, accepting 4000$ is better than risking getting nothing at all in the later rounds."
