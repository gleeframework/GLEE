"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a decent amount""
}
```

I'm proposing that we divide the $1,000,000 70/30 in my favor, which is a relatively generous offer considering the game's inflation mechanics."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fair, considering the money is worth less with each round. Let's find a compromise. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'm in a relatively stronger position.

Considering Bob's message and the numbers, I think this is a fair compromise. I accept the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
