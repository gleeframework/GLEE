"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

This is a classic negotiation game, and I'm going to try to maximize my gains while also being aware of Bob's decreasing value of money. I'm starting with a very lopsided offer, hoping to get a quick agreement, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if Bob rejects it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still very lopsided, but it's closer to a fair division than my first offer. However, I'm still confident I can get a better deal. I'll reject this offer and see what Bob proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I'm increasing my offer to Alice by 5%, hoping to find a middle ground. I'm still aiming for a good deal, but I'm also recognizing that time is running out, and each round further diminishes the value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to 50/50, and the value of the money is decreasing significantly for both of us. It's time to accept and secure something before the value of the money drops even further."
