**Reasoning:**

Even though Alice is moving closer to a 50/50 split, the inflation is working significantly in my favor. I can afford to hold out a bit longer and aim for a slightly better deal.  Alice is feeling the pressure of the decreasing value, making her more likely to concede in later rounds."
