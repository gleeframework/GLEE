"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. 60/40 seems fair. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. 60/40 is a pretty lopsided split, and I'm confident I can get a better deal. Plus, I know Alice is facing a much steeper inflation rate, so she might be more willing to compromise in later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to split it 60/40 in your favor, Alice. Let's get this done quickly before the inflation hits too hard.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your generosity is appreciated, but let's be realistic. This is a negotiation, after all. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd still like a bit more, the inflation is hitting us both hard. This offer is closer to what I was aiming for, and I don't want to risk losing more money.  Let's end this before the situation worsens."
