"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal! I take $70, you take $30.  This gives us a good starting point for negotiations. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While the offer is tempting, it's worth seeing if Alice is willing to give up more, especially since the money loses value for her more quickly.  Let's see what she proposes in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a fair share, but I need to secure more for myself to make this worthwhile. Let's split it 60/40, with me taking the larger portion. What do you think?""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your offer was tempting, but it doesn't account for the rapid inflation we're facing.  I'm willing to compromise - let's go with $65 for me and $35 for you.  This is a fair deal considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, the inflation is hurting Alice more than me.  Accepting this offer secures a decent amount for me, and it's better than risking getting nothing."
