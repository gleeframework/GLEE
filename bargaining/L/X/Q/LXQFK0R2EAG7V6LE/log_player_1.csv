Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a fair share, but I need to secure more for myself to make this worthwhile. Let's split it 60/40, with me taking the larger portion. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60
