"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nIn this offer, I, Alice, propose to take $55, which is a bit more than half, but still leaves Bob with a substantial amount, considering the value of money will decrease over rounds. The message aims to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness while also setting a starting point that is slightly in my favor, anticipating the depreciation of the money's value over time. This strategy aims to find a balance between being fair and maximizing my gain, considering the rules of the game.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you wanting a larger share, but this split seems more equitable to me. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject Bob's offer because, considering the inflation, accepting $45 in the second round means I would actually be getting less value than if I had accepted a similar offer in the first round. Additionally, given that the money's value decreases more significantly for me (20% less each round) compared to Bob (5% less each round), I feel pressured to try and secure a better deal in the subsequent rounds before the value drops even further. Rejecting this offer gives me the opportunity to propose a new division in the next round that might be more favorable to me.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know the outcome of my decision."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I need a bit more to make it worthwhile""}\n\nIn this offer, I, Alice, propose to take $58, increasing my share from the previous rounds. Given that the value of money decreases by 20% for me with each passing round, I feel compelled to compensate for this loss by aiming for a higher amount. The message to Bob explains my reasoning, emphasizing the impact of inflation on my decision-making. By framing it as a necessity due to the game's mechanics rather than mere greed, I hope to make the offer more palatable to Bob, while still prioritizing maximizing my gain.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The value is dropping quickly for both of us. This offer is my compromise to end this quickly and fairly. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject Bob's offer because, despite the rapidly decreasing value of the money for both of us, his proposed division doesn't sufficiently account for the significantly higher rate of depreciation I'm experiencing. Accepting $48 now would represent a value substantially lower than what I could have accepted in earlier rounds, and given the game's progression, I believe there's still room for negotiation that could result in a more favorable outcome for me. Furthermore, Bob's message, while emphasizing the need for a quick resolution, doesn't fully acknowledge the disproportionate impact of inflation on my potential earnings, suggesting there might be more flexibility in his position than he's letting on.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know the outcome of my decision."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Inflation is hitting me hard, need a better split to compensate""}\n\nIn this offer, I, Alice, propose to take $60, further increasing my share. Given that the value of money has decreased by nearly 50% for me compared to the first round, I feel it's necessary to push for a larger portion to make up for the loss. The message to Bob reiterates the impact of inflation on my position, aiming to convey that my increasing demands are not merely aggressive negotiation tactics but a response to the game's mechanics. By framing my offer in this context, I aim to persuade Bob that accepting this division is reasonable under the circumstances, as it acknowledges the disproportionate effect of inflation on my potential earnings.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be realistic. The value is plummeting each round. A 50/50 split is the fairest option at this point. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI accept Bob's offer because, at this point in the game, the value of the money has decreased significantly for both of us, but especially for me, having lost over 67% of its original value. Given the rapid depreciation and the fact that we are already halfway through the game, I believe that securing a 50/50 split now is a better option than risking further rounds where the value could drop even more drastically. Bob's message emphasizes the need for realism in our negotiations, and given the current state of the game, I agree that a 50/50 split is a fair and reasonable outcome. Accepting this offer ensures that I receive a known quantity rather than gambling on potentially worse outcomes in future rounds.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know the outcome of my decision."
