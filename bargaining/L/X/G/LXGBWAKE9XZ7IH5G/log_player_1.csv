"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm starting with a fair and simple proposal, hoping Bob will accept it!"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'll give you a small share. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's trying to take the majority, eh?

I'll think carefully...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting this offer, as I think I can do better than 20% of the remaining value. The inflation is already starting to bite, and I want to keep my options open for future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Time for my next move!

```

# Alice gain: 10

Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is biting hard!

Bob's trying to take the majority again, but this time with an even more lopsided offer. I'm not impressed.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and hope that Bob will make a more reasonable proposal in the next round. 10% of the remaining value is too low for me to accept."

# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's getting more aggressive, but I'm not backing down!

With the inflation eating away at the value, I need to think carefully about this offer. 5% of the remaining value is a very low offer, but I'm not sure if I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

Do you accept this offer?","It's the final round!

With the inflation having decimated the value, 0.5% of the remaining value is almost nothing. I'd rather take a chance and try to negotiate a better deal, but since this is the last round, I'll consider it.

However, I'm not going to accept an offer that gives me essentially nothing. I'll reject this offer and hope that Bob will understand that I'm not willing to settle for such a tiny share.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

It looks like we're going to end up with nothing, but I'd rather go out with some pride and dignity!"
