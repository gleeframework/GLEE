I'm going to offer Bob a very small amount to start. I'm hoping he'll accept it, but I'm prepared to play the long game if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

A 50/50 split is fair, and I'd rather get something than risk getting nothing in the later rounds."
