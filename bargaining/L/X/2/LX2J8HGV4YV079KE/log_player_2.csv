Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, I'll try to make a better one. I'll offer her a smaller share to increase my chances of getting a higher share later on.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 19% less for Alice, her offer is actually equivalent to a 61.8% share of the original amount, which is a significant increase from her previous offer. I'll accept this offer to avoid further rounds and get a decent share of the money.
