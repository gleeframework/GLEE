I'm Bob, and I'm not going to accept a deal where I get only 25% of the money.  Let's see what Alice offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}
``` 

I'm going to offer Alice a 45/55 split. It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident that if she rejects it, I'll be in a stronger position in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice is still offering me a relatively low share, even with the inflation affecting her side more. I'm confident I can get a better deal, so I'm going to reject this offer and see what she comes up with next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}
```

I'm going to increase my offer slightly to 60/40.  This is still a fair split considering the inflation, and it should be tempting enough for Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Alice finally made a fair offer! Even with the inflation, a 50/50 split is a good deal. I'm happy to accept it and end the game."
