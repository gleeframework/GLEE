"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting 600,000$ and Bob getting 400,000$."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but not too much! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, so I'll have to adjust my expectations.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about the 30-70 split, but I'll have to weigh the pros and cons. Since the money is worth less with each passing round, I'd rather not risk going to the next round and facing another 20% decrease in value.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
