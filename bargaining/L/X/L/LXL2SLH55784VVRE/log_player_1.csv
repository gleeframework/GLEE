"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take the lower amount this round, hoping we can negotiate a better deal later.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You took the lower amount last round, now it's my turn to take the higher amount. This is my first offer, take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about it. With inflation, my gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, so I'm effectively getting $7600 (8000 * 0.95) if I accept this offer. On the other hand, Bob is taking a larger share, which might be a good opportunity for me to get a better deal later.

I'll reject this offer for now.

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, my gain is worth 5% less than in the previous round, so I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share this round, but I'm hoping we can reach a more balanced split later.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're taking a smaller share again, I'll take the larger share this round. But don't think this means I'll be softening my stance next round! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly due to inflation. If I accept this offer, my gain would be worth $1720 (2000 * 0.86, considering the 14.26% reduction from the first round). However, I'm concerned that if I accept this offer, Bob might not be willing to compromise further, and I might be left with a smaller share in future rounds.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation continuing to erode the value of the money, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle this round, but I'm still hoping for a more balanced split later.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to get impatient. You're not willing to meet me in the middle, so I'll take a larger share this round. Don't expect me to be so generous next time! 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, and Bob is becoming increasingly aggressive in his offers. If I accept this offer, my gain would be worth $860 (1000 * 0.86, considering the 22.62% reduction from the first round). However, I'm concerned that if I accept this offer, Bob will continue to take larger shares, and I might be left with a very small amount in future rounds.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.
