"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money 90-10 to start, and we can reassess in the next round.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount to begin with, and I'll take the remaining $900,000. My message to Bob is to set a baseline for the split and see if he's willing to accept a relatively small amount upfront."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money 50-50, a fair start 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, and I need to be more cautious. I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

After considering the offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 50-50 split just yet, especially since I know that the money is worth less due to inflation. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect, my offer needs to be adjusted accordingly. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I need to prioritize my own gain due to the inflation.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, which is a smaller share than before, but I'm trying to be more generous than the 50-50 split he proposed earlier. My message to Bob is to convey that I'm willing to compromise, but I need to protect my own interests in this inflationary environment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share due to the inflation 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking its toll, and my offer's value is decreasing rapidly. I need to be careful with this new offer from Bob.

After considering the offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 40-60 split, especially since Bob is now asking for a larger share. I think I can do better than that, considering the inflation is affecting my gains more severely. I'll try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really taking its toll now. My offer needs to be adjusted accordingly. Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to ensure I get a decent share considering the inflation is affecting me more.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a smaller share than before, but I'm trying to be more generous than the 40-60 split he proposed earlier. My message to Bob is to convey that I'm willing to compromise, but I need to prioritize my own gain in this challenging inflationary environment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think I've been generous enough considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really eating away at my potential gains. I need to be careful with this new offer from Bob.

After considering the offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm willing to accept a 30-70 split, considering the severe impact of inflation on my potential gains. I think it's better to accept this offer and get something rather than risking it and potentially getting nothing in the remaining rounds."
