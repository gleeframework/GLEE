Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a very lopsided offer in the first round.  I want to see if Bob is willing to accept even a tiny amount, or if he's going to play it tough.  Since inflation is a factor, I'm banking on him wanting something now rather than risk getting nothing later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting this offer.  While it's a lot less than I initially wanted, it's still a significant amount of money.  The inflation factor is starting to kick in, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all.  Plus, I'm curious to see how Bob's strategy unfolds in the next few rounds."
