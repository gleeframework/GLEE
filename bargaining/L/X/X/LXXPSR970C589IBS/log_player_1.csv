"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 40% and take 60%""
}
```

This offer gives me a significant portion of the money, but still leaves Bob with a substantial amount. I'm hoping he'll accept this generous offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'll still give you a decent share 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation taking its toll, the money is worth less than before.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about taking only 300,000, but it's still a better option than going to the next round. I'll accept this offer.
