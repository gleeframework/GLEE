Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 95/5 split is more fair.  It's a good deal for both of us, and it keeps the game moving forward. 
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000

Round 3

{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better share than 5%. Let's split it 70/30. It's still a significant gain for you, and it gives me a more reasonable cut.""}

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a larger share, but 70/30 is still too much for me. Let's split it 80/20. This is a good deal for both of us, and it keeps the game going. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would prefer a larger share, with the inflation affecting my gains significantly, accepting the 80/20 split is the most beneficial option at this point."
