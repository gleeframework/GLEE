```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small amount, hoping he'll accept quickly and we can avoid losing value due to inflation."

Round 2

# Bob's message: Meet me halfway 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to meet me halfway, huh? That's a fair offer, but I think I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate for a better deal. The money is worth 10% less now, so I want to get a bigger share to compensate for the loss."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 10% less again, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to make up for the loss.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```
