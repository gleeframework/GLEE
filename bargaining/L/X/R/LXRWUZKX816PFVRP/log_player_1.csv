"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering the inflation risk affects you more than me. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3

""alice_gain"": 5500,

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the increasing inflation impact on your gain, I think a 58/42 split is a reasonable adjustment. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is taking advantage of my position and the inflation factor. While the offer is getting closer to a 50/50 split, I need to remain firm to secure a reasonable amount. Accepting now would set a bad precedent and likely lead to an even worse offer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. The clock is ticking and the value is decreasing. I'm offering you 4800 which is a fair deal considering the circumstances. Let's close this out.""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Time Pressure:** The further the game goes, the less valuable the money becomes for Alice due to inflation. It's crucial to settle sooner rather than later.
* **Strategic Compromise:** Offering 5200 for herself shows a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a share above 50%. This might be more appealing to Bob than a stubborn 50/50 proposition.
* **Finality:** The tone of the message implies this is Alice's final offer, prompting Bob to make a decision quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the significant impact of inflation on your gain, I believe a 60/40 split in my favor is now justified. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision, but the relentless march of inflation is forcing my hand. 

* **Diminishing Returns:**  While 4000 is significantly less than my initial target, waiting longer will only result in an even smaller amount. Accepting now cuts my losses. 
* **Bob's Stance:** Bob seems firm in his position, and it's unlikely he'll agree to anything better than this, especially with how the game is progressing.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a slightly better offer in a future round carries the significant risk of ending up with even less if Bob continues pushing his advantage. 

It's frustrating to settle for less than initially desired, but in this scenario, accepting a less-than-ideal offer is the most logical choice."
