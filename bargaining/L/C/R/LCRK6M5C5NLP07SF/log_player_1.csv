"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. I believe this is a fair starting point, as I am willing to share a significant portion of the money with Bob.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 272728 
# Bob gain: 727272 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. While I understand the value of the money has decreased, a 27/73 split is significantly worse than my initial proposal. I believe I can still get a better deal, especially as the money continues to lose value with each round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still reflects the fact that I am willing to share a substantial portion of the money.  The value of the money is decreasing, so it's important to reach an agreement sooner rather than later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 423424 
# Bob gain: 576576 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. The inflation is starting to significantly impact the value of the money, but a 42/58 split is still far too unbalanced in favor of Bob. I believe we can find a more equitable solution."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  This is a further compromise, recognizing the increasing impact of inflation.  While I would prefer a more even split, I'm willing to make concessions to reach an agreement before the value of the money drops even further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 545455 
# Bob gain: 454545 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I accept this offer.  While the inflation has significantly decreased the value of the money, a 54/46 split is a reasonable compromise. I'm willing to take it to avoid risking getting nothing at all."
