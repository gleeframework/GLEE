Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a very lopsided offer in my favor, hoping Bob will accept it. Even though I know inflation is a factor, I'm not sure how much it will affect him, and I want to maximize my share in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, accepting a 50/50 split is a good deal in this round. Inflation has significantly reduced the value of Bob's offer, and it's likely that further rounds will result in even lower gains for me. This seems like the most reasonable outcome given the current situation."
