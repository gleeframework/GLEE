"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Inflation is taking its toll, and my potential gain is worth 10% less than in the previous round.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000
}
```

I'm trying to negotiate a slightly better split this time around."

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The offers are getting more skewed towards Bob's favor, and my potential gain is worth even less due to inflation.

After considering Bob's offer, I decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 40-60 split, especially considering the value of my potential gain is decreasing rapidly due to inflation. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."

{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000
}

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The offers are getting more and more skewed towards Bob's favor, and my potential gain is worth a significant portion less due to inflation.

After considering Bob's offer, I decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept a 30-70 split, especially considering the value of my potential gain is decreasing rapidly due to inflation. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round, but it's getting increasingly difficult."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Inflation is really accelerating now, and my potential gain is worth 42.45% less than in the first round.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm trying to find a fair split, considering the rapidly decreasing value of the money. A 50-50 split seems like a reasonable compromise at this point."
