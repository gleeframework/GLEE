"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, giving Bob a significant portion of the money. Let's see if he accepts!"

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me. I'll have to think carefully.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth less after two rounds of inflation, I'll make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```"

# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money! With the money worth 14.26% less for me and 27.1% less for Bob, I'm starting to feel the pinch.

However, I don't want to give up too much more. I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

```

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","The money is getting less valuable by the round! I'll have to be strategic about how I make my offer.

Since Bob's offer was quite one-sided last round, I'll try to push for a more balanced deal this time.

  ""bob_gain"": 580000

```"

# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money! With the money worth 22.62% less for me and 40.95% less for Bob, I'm starting to feel the pinch.

However, I'm not sure if I can do better than this offer. The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, and I don't want to risk waiting for a better offer that may not come.
