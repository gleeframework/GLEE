I'm going to make a significant concession this round to try and get Bob to agree. He's clearly not going to accept a deal where I get the vast majority, so I'm going to try and get a 4:1 split in my favor. I'm hoping this offer is enough for him to accept, and I still get a decent portion of the money."
