"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of 4000 is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, which is 4800. Bob's gain of 6000 is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, which is 4800.

Since the offer is now 4000 for me and 4800 for Bob, I'll accept this offer.
