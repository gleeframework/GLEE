"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer leaves us both with a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not going to accept this offer. I want a bigger share of the money. It's not fair that Alice gets 70% of the money. I'm willing to take the risk of the money being worth less in the next round to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think 60-40 is a more reasonable split. The money is worth 20% less to me now, so I'm taking that into account.""}\n\nI'm making a counteroffer that gives me a larger share of the money. Since the money is worth 20% less to me now, I'm trying to make up for that by asking for a bigger percentage. I hope Alice will consider this offer and we can come to an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The value decreases quickly for you. This is a good deal while there's still value left for you. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not going to accept this offer. Even though the money is worth 36% less to me now, I still think I can get a better deal. Alice is trying to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth less to me, but I'm not going to give up yet. I'll keep trying to negotiate for a better split.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bigger share. The money may be worth less to me, but I'm not going to give up yet.""}\n\nI'm making another counteroffer, trying to find a middle ground that Alice will accept. I'm taking into account the fact that the money is worth even less to me now, but I'm still trying to get a decent share. I hope Alice will consider this offer and we can come to an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. The value is practically disappearing for you. Take this deal before it's worth even less! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI've decided to accept Alice's offer. The money is worth almost 60% less to me now, and I don't think I can get a better deal. I've tried to negotiate, but Alice is not budging. I'd rather take the 40% now than risk losing even more value in the next round. It's not the best deal, but I think it's the best I can get under the circumstances."
