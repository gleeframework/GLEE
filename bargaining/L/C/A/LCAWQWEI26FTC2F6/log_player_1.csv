"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further""
}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn!"

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't think I should accept an offer that leaves me with a smaller share of the money, especially when Bob is claiming he deserves more for his negotiation skills. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```

# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really eating away at my potential gains! Given that the money I gain is now worth significantly less, I'm not willing to accept an offer that leaves me with such a small share. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.
