Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a slightly unfair offer, hoping Bob will accept it.  I want to see how greedy he is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is fair and the inflation means my offer is worth less now. It's better to accept and get something than risk getting nothing in the next round."
