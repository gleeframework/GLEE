Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise and split the money 60/40. It's not my ideal situation, but I think it's fair given the inflation factor. Let's end this round and get the money distributed. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000
