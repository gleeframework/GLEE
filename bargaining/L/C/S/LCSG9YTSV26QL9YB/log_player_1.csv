"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the 100$ and Bob gets 30%. This is a fair split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly bigger share 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of 60$ is actually worth 60 * 0.9 = 54$ and Bob's gain of 40$ is actually worth 40 * 0.8 = 32$. 

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 40% and I rejected it, I'll try to negotiate a better deal for myself. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 65,
  ""bob_gain"": 35,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a bit more""
}
```

I'm proposing a 65% share for myself and 35% for Bob. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting desperate, let's just split it 50/50 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values of the gains considering the inflation:

My gain of 50$ is worth 50 * 0.727 = 36.35$ (27.1% less than the original 100%).
Bob's gain of 50$ is worth 50 * 0.516 = 25.8$ (48.8% less than the original 100%).

A 50/50 split is a reasonable offer, considering the inflation. I'll accept it:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
