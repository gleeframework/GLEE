"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can seal the deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Fair is fair. Let's split it 90/10, and I'll make sure to remember this gesture in the future. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to take advantage of me!

I'll reject his offer. The 90/10 split is not fair, and I'm not interested in making a ""favor"" for Bob that would leave me with only 10% of the money. My response is:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, the money is worth 40% less than in the first round. I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""A more balanced offer. You get a decent share, but I'm not giving away too much.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share, but still a significant one, hoping he'll accept and we can move on."
