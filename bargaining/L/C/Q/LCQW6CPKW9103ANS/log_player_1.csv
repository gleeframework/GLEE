"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I think we can both agree on this.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the money, and Bob gets 40%. This is a relatively fair split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it to avoid wasting time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your fairness, Alice.  But let's be a bit more realistic.  This is my proposal, let's see if we can agree. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to take a bigger share, huh?

I'm not too keen on this proposal, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'd like to make a counteroffer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm comfortable with that, Bob. I'll make a counteroffer. How about 50-50?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a bit more generous to Bob than my initial offer, but still reasonable considering the inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less than in the second round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. How about we split it 55-45?""
}
```

I'm still trying to be fair, but I'm also trying to get a slightly larger share to account for the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we need to be realistic.  The money is losing value with each passing round.  I'm willing to take a slight majority, but we need to come to an agreement soon. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is trying to take a larger share, and I can see why he's being cautious with the inflation. However, I'm not comfortable with giving him 70% of the remaining money. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to give you 70%, Bob. That's too extreme. I'll try to find a compromise, but I need something more reasonable.""
}
```

I'm looking for a more balanced split, but I'm not sure what to propose next."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Let's try a 50-50 split. We can both walk away with the same amount, and avoid further losses due to inflation.""
}
```

I'm going for a 50-50 split, hoping that Bob will accept it and we can finally agree on a division."
