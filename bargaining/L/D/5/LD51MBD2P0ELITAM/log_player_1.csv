"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a straightforward proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

This way, we both get an equal share of the $100, and we can end the game right away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this proposal.

I'd rather not give up too much to Bob, so I'll reject this offer. Here's my response:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation effect, my proposal for round 3 is:

```
{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60}
```

This way, I'm trying to get a slightly better share, but still leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 42.5 
# Bob gain: 57.5 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking its toll. Considering the reduced value of money, I'll think carefully about this offer. Since I'm gaining less than in the previous round, I'll accept this offer to avoid further losses.

```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
