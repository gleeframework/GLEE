Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable. I'll take a slightly smaller share than your offer, but I'm sure we can both agree this is fair. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
Reason: While Alice's offer is closer to a reasonable split, she's still trying to take advantage of me. I'm willing to negotiate, but not if it means consistently getting the worse end of the deal.  The shrinking pot adds pressure, but I'm betting she'll be more agreeable in the next round.
