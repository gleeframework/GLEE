"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself. The message is a friendly one, inviting Bob to make a proposal of his own."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair.  Let's see if you agree! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation has already taken its toll, and the money is worth 5% less than in the first round.

I notice that Bob's offer is identical to my initial offer, which he rejected. I'll try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not a good enough offer. I want a higher share.""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and encouraging him to make a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation has reduced the value of the money by another 5%, making it even less valuable than before.

Considering Bob's previous offer, I'll try to negotiate a better deal for myself. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's split it 55/45!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 450,000$ and keeping 550,000$ for myself, trying to find a more balanced split."
