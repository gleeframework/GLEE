Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable. I understand you want a larger share, but the value decreases for me each round. This split is fair and ensures we both benefit before time runs out. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
