I'm going to start with a proposal that favors me slightly, as I'm the one making the offer. I'm assuming Bob will be rational and accept this, as it's still a decent gain for him. We'll see what happens!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

While I'd prefer to have more, the inflation is a serious concern. Accepting this offer means I get half the money, which is a lot better than potentially getting nothing at all in later rounds."
