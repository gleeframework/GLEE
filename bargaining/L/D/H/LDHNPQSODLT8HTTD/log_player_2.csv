"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair deal. I'll take 90, you get 10. We can adjust later if you prefer. 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I'm Bob and I'm not going to accept this offer. 10 dollars isn't much, and I'm hoping for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is more fair. Let's start with this and see where it goes.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but 60/40 is still too lopsided. Let's split it 65/35. We can work towards a more balanced agreement if you prefer. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I'd prefer a bit more, it's better than nothing and Alice is offering a more balanced split this time."
