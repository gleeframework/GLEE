"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

This way, I get 70% of the initial $100, and Bob gets 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 60, it's a good starting point. Your turn to negotiate! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the money is worth less, so I need to adjust my expectations.

Since Bob's offer is 60, I'll try to negotiate a bit more. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a bit too generous for Bob. I'll counter with 45 for me.""
}
```

I'm trying to get a slightly better deal, considering the inflation effect."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect, the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round. Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you halfway. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly better deal for Bob, but still trying to get a decent share for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Your turn to think! 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the money is worth even less, and my share is smaller. Considering Bob's message, it seems like he's trying to be more generous, but I still need to think carefully.

Since my gain is 55, which is more than my previous offer of 45, I'll consider this a good opportunity to accept. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
