Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair. It gives you a good starting point and still leaves plenty of room for negotiation if you're not satisfied. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500
