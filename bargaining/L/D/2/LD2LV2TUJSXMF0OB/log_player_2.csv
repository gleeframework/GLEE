"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 90/10 split. It's a fair starting point, considering the inflation rate affects you more than me. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While Alice's offer is generous, the inflation rate heavily disadvantages me. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the following rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I propose a 60/40 split. It's more balanced considering the inflation impacts on both of us.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise further, but I need a larger share to make up for the inflation hitting me harder. Let's aim for a 70/30 split this time. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While the offer is still not ideal, the inflation rate is working against me rapidly.  Accepting a 30% share is better than risking losing more money in the following rounds."
