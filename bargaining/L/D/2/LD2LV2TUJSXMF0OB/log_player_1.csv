Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: I propose a 60/40 split. It's more balanced considering the inflation impacts on both of us.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000
