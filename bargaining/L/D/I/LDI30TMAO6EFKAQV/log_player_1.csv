"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects the time pressure we're both under.""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, my turn. I'm feeling generous, but let's make it worthwhile for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I need to think about this. Bob's offer is better than what I would get if I reject and get my way in the next round. 

Here's my analysis:

* **If I accept:** I get $4500.
* **If I reject:**
    * The total pot shrinks to $9500 due to inflation for me. 
    * Even if I propose taking the entire pot in the next round, I'll only get $9500, which is still less than Bob's current offer. 

Therefore, it makes sense to accept Bob's offer, even though it's not ideal.
