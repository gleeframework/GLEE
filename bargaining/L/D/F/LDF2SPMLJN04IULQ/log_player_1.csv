"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you take 40%""
}
```

Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a larger share now, but you can still get a decent amount 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more careful with the inflation in mind.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting this offer. I'd like to make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my offer is worth 20% less than in the previous round, so I'll aim for a higher percentage to account for the decrease in value. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a slightly larger share now, but I'm willing to compromise""
}
