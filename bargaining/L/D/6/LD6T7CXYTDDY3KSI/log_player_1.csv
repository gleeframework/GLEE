"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my initial offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me a slightly larger share of the initial $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain is worth 10% less, so I need to be more cautious. However, Bob's offer of a 50-50 split is a fair one, and I'm not sure if I'll get a better offer later on. I'll accept this offer.
