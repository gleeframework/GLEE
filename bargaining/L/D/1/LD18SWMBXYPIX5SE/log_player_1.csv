"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60-40. Accept and we're done!""
}
```

This offer gives me 60% of the original $10,000, which is $6,000, and Bob gets 40%, or $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but still a decent share for you 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","In the second round, my gain of $2,000 is worth 80% of its original value due to the 20% inflation, which is $1,600.

I'm not sure if I want to accept Bob's offer, but it's a better option than going into another round. I'll decide to accept his offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
