Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.

**Reasoning:**

While time is running out and inflation is eating into the potential gains, Alice's offer is still too low. Accepting a deal below 50% sets a bad precedent and  significantly undervalues Bob's position in the negotiation. It's worth the risk of continuing to negotiate for a better deal in the next few rounds."
