Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to divide the money. We both get an equal share, and it avoids any potential conflicts. Let's call it a day! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{
