"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60, you take 40.""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount of money to start with, and we can negotiate from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a larger share, but it's still a fair deal for me. Your turn to decide! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject the offer for now. I'd like to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 36,
  ""bob_gain"": 64,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a smaller share this time. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping a decent amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take most of the money, but it's a low risk for me. Your turn to decide! 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering the drastic reduction in value, I'll have to be cautious. Bob's offer is tempting, but I'd rather not give up most of the money.

I'll reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The value of money is decreasing rapidly!

Here's my next offer, taking into account the reduced value:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 12,
  ""bob_gain"": 88,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a minimal share, but I'm willing to compromise. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

This offer is quite aggressive, but I'm trying to make the most of the decreasing value of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take almost all the money, but it's getting late. Your last chance to reconsider! 
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is plummeting!

Considering the drastic reduction in value, I'm running out of options. With only a few rounds left, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

However, taking only $1 is not a viable option for me. I'd rather risk it and try to get a slightly better deal.

I'll reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The value of money is almost worthless at this point!

Here's my next offer, taking into account the extreme reduction in value:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 0.5,
  ""bob_gain"": 99.5,
  ""message"": ""I'll take the last scraps. It's not ideal, but I'll take what I can get.""
}
```

This offer is essentially surrendering to Bob, but I'm trying to salvage what's left."
