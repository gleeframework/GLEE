Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Alice, I'll make a proposal that takes this into account. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effects of inflation, I'll think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth less for me, I'd like to get a larger share to compensate for the decrease in value. However, I don't want to reject the offer and risk getting an even worse deal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
