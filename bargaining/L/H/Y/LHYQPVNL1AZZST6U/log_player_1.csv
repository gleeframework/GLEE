"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","My proposal was rejected, and now Bob is offering a 50/50 split. I'll accept this offer.
