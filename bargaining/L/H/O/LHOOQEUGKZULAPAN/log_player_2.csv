"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split somewhat fairly, with a slight advantage for me considering the inflation. This way we both avoid the risk of getting a worse deal in later rounds. 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than that. This offer accounts for your preferred inflation adjustment, while still giving me a reasonable share.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. This is my final offer, and it's more than fair considering the inflation is eating into my share with every passing round. If we don't agree now, we'll both lose out. 
# Bob gain: 5012.5 
# Alice gain: 4987.5
