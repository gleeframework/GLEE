"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's divide fairly, considering the inflation rates, I'll take a bit more to compensate 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see if Alice is willing to negotiate further.  I'm not happy with getting only 400,000, especially since the money will be worth less for me in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to be generous, but I need more to account for the inflation hitting me harder.  Let's split it closer to 55/45.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation is hitting you harder, I'll meet you in the middle, but I still think I deserve a bigger share 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still not satisfied with the offer.  I need a larger share to make up for the inflation hitting me harder."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split this evenly, considering the inflation rates are now affecting both of us significantly.  A 50/50 split is the fairest option at this point.""}
