Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI've decided to accept Bob's offer in Round 8. The increasing inflation rate is significantly impacting the value of the money for me, and Bob's offer of a 58-42 split seems reasonable at this point, considering his message that it's his final offer. Continuing to reject and aiming for a higher share risks losing everything if we reach the 12th round without an agreement.\n\n###\n\nPlease let Bob know that I accept his offer in Round 8."
