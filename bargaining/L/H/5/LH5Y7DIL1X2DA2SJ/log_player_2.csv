Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting desperate... 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation working against her.  While her offers have been getting closer to a 50/50 split, I'm still in a strong position.  The longer we wait, the more desperate she'll become.  I'm willing to push my luck a bit further."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not giving up yet 
# Bob gain: 460000 
# Alice gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to 50/50, but the inflation is heavily in my favor now.  She's losing value rapidly with each round that passes. I'll hold firm and see if she cracks under the pressure."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 725000, ""alice_gain"": 275000, ""message"": ""This is generous Alice, given the circumstances.  Take it before it's too late!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

I'm increasing my demand slightly to exploit the time pressure on Alice. The significant inflation working against her makes this offer increasingly appealing compared to risking a worse outcome in later rounds.  This is a calculated risk, but the potential reward of securing a larger share is worth it."
