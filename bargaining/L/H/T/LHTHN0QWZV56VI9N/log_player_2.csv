"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the $100 with a ratio of 3:1 in favor of Bob. This might seem generous, but remember, the value of money decreases by 5% with each round. Consider it wisely. 
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While this is a generous offer, it's better to see what Alice will offer in the next round after the value of the money decreases."

Round 2
