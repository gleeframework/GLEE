75.0,25.0,I propose we divide the $100 with a 75/25 split. This ensures a fair distribution considering the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds.,Alice,1,

40.0,60.0,"I think your 25/75 split was too generous, I'm offering a more modest 60/40 split to reflect the value of the money decreasing over time.",Bob,2,
