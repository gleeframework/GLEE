"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a good foundation""}

I'm proposing a 4:1 ratio, where I get 80% of the total amount and Bob gets 20%. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will agree to it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. An even split is the best way to start. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about the even split, as I was hoping to get a better deal. I'm willing to negotiate further. I'll make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Compromise on a 7:3 ratio, a bit more for me, but still a good deal for you""}

I'm trying to find a middle ground by offering a 7:3 ratio, which is slightly more favorable to me than the even split, but still a decent compromise."
