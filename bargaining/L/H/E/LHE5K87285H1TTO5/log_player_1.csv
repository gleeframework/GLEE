"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

This offer is designed to be very tempting for Bob. He'll be getting a small amount, but the potential for him to get more in the next round might be outweighed by the risk of getting nothing at all if he rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I initially wanted a larger share, it's clear that Bob is willing to negotiate. Given the potential for inflation affecting future rounds, it's better to accept the 50/50 split now."
