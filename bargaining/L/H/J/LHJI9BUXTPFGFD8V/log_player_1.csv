Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out, let's meet in the middle. This offer ensures we both benefit. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to a more even split, time is working in my favor.  The longer the game goes on, the less valuable the money is to him due to the higher inflation rate.  I'll hold out for a better offer."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5300,
""bob_gain"": 4700,
""message"": ""We need to reach an agreement soon. This is a slight improvement for you, and time is on my side.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency:** I'm making it clear that time is running out, applying a bit of pressure on Bob. 
* **Small Concession:** I'm increasing my previous offer slightly to show willingness to negotiate, but still keeping the majority of the share.
* **Time Advantage:**  Bob's inflation rate is higher, so each round that passes gives me a stronger position. I'm hoping this offer will entice him to settle before his share decreases further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is it - a perfectly even split.  Let's end this before inflation eats away at our potential gains. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has finally agreed to an even split. While I was hoping to secure a slight advantage, accepting this offer guarantees a reasonable share before inflation further diminishes the value.  It's a better outcome than risking continued rejection and potentially ending up with nothing."
