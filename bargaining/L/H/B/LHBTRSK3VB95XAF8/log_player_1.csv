I'm going to take a bigger chunk of the money now.  This way, I'll be able to make a much larger profit even if Bob rejects this offer. The inflation is becoming a significant factor, so I need to get more of the money while I can."

While it is a very small portion of the total amount, I am accepting Bob's offer. With inflation, the value of the money Bob is offering will continue to decrease. The game is almost over, so I have to settle for a small gain instead of risking getting nothing at all."
