575000.0,425000.0,"Bob, I appreciate the counter-offer, but let's be realistic. I'm offering a 57.5/42.5 split to end this now. It's a good deal considering the inflation is hitting you harder than me.",Alice,3,

525000.0,475000.0,"Alice, this is getting us nowhere. I'm willing to meet you halfway - a 52.5/47.5 split.  Every round costs us both. Let's be sensible and wrap this up.",Bob,4,
