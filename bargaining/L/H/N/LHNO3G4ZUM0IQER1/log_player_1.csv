This is a very simple strategy that prioritizes maximizing my gains in the first round.  I'm aware that the money depreciates for me with each round, so I want to secure as much as possible while it's still worth the most. We'll see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a tough decision, but I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  Here's why:

* **Inflation:** While I'm losing 20% of the value of my gains with each round, I still have the potential to earn more if we keep playing. 
* **Power Shift:**  If I accept this offer, Bob has essentially won the game.  By rejecting, I maintain the ability to make an offer in the next round and potentially secure a better deal. 

It's a gamble, but I believe the potential rewards of continuing outweigh the risk of accepting Bob's current offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

Here's the strategy behind this offer:

* **Inflation:** I'm taking into account the continued inflation and trying to find a balance between maximizing my gains and ensuring a potential agreement.
* **Compromise:**  This offer represents a compromise from my initial proposal. I'm reducing my desired gain from 90 to 60, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Risk Assessment:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I'm aware that my gains will continue to depreciate, but I still have the option to make a counter-offer in the next round. 

I believe this offer strikes a balance between securing a decent portion of the money and keeping the negotiation alive."
