"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start!""}

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40. I think this is a fair starting point, and it's a good way to begin the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than a 60/40 split, but I'm willing to compromise a bit.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'm willing to negotiate. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I think I should get a bit more. I'll make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""I'm willing to consider a 50/50 split, but I think I deserve a bit more given the current value of the money. Can we meet in the middle at 55/45?""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share, but I think 55/45 is a fair compromise given the current value of the money.""}

I'm trying to find a middle ground, and I think 55/45 is a reasonable split considering the inflation."
