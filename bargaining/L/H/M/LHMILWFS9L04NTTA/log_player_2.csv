"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly to start! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm Bob, and I'm going to be greedy!  I know the money loses value each round, so I'll try to get a better deal later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think we can do better than a 60/40 split, but I'm willing to compromise a bit.  Let's see if we can make this work.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share, but I think 55/45 is a fair compromise given the current value of the money. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd still prefer more, the value of the money is dropping rapidly, and I don't want to risk getting nothing.  55/45 is a decent split considering the circumstances."
