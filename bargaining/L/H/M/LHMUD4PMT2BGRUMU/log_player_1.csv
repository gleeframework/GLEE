"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""
}
```

This way, we both get a relatively equal share of the $100, and I get a slight edge since I'm the first to make the proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal this time 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, I need to consider the reduced value of the money. In this case, the offer is:

* My gain: $45 (which is 90% of the original $50, due to 5% inflation)
* Bob's gain: $55

Considering the reduced value of my gain, I'd rather accept this offer to avoid further rounds and potential losses due to inflation.
