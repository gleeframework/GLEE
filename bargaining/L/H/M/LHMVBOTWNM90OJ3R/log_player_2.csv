"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. While it seems fair at first glance, considering the inflation, I can likely get a better deal for myself by proposing in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is a fair starting point, given the inflation we both face. Let's work together to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation impact, I'm willing to adjust, but I still believe I deserve the larger share. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still going to reject this offer. While Alice has adjusted her proposal, it's still not taking into account the full impact of inflation on me. I believe I can secure a better deal for myself by continuing to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger share to compensate for the inflation. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.""}
