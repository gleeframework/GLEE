I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  This is a good starting point, considering I'm taking the hit of a bigger inflation penalty. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob's offer is worse for me than my original proposal. I'm taking a bigger hit from inflation, and he's getting more.  Let's see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm proposing a 50/50 split.  Considering the inflation, this seems like a fair compromise.  Let's see if Bob will accept."
