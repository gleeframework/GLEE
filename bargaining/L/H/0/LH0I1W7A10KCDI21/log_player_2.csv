This is a tough one, and ideally, I'd hold out for a better deal. However, Alice is clearly playing hardball, and the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. Accepting a 43/57 split now is better than risking getting nothing in the later rounds or being forced to accept an even worse offer under pressure as the deadline approaches."
