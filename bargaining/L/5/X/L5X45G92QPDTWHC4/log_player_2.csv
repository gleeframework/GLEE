Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's compromise.  I'll give you a bit more, but I still need a fair share after the inflation hit. 
# Bob gain: 52 
# Alice gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI'll take the 52, considering the inflation, it's better to secure this amount now rather than risking further devaluation."
