Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent share, but I'm not going to be too generous. You can try to do better next time. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer.  While it's better than nothing, I'm not convinced Bob is taking inflation seriously enough.  I think I can get a better deal next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""I'm still willing to be fair, but I need to make sure my share reflects the value of my time.  Let's split it 70/30. We can both make a good profit if we work together.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going to give in to your demands. You're not getting 70% of the pie. I'll give you a slightly better offer, but don't expect me to be generous. 
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm going to accept this offer. While I'd prefer a higher share, Bob's message makes it clear he's not going to budge much. Accepting this offer is a reasonable way to secure some of the money before inflation eats away at it any further."
