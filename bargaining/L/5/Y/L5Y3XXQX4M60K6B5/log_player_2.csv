"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, 60-40 is reasonable 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see if I can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better.  Let's try a 65-35 split.  This is fair considering I'll be taking the risk of you rejecting my offer and moving to the next round.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise. 57-43 is the best I can offer. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd like to get more, it's better to take what I can get than risk losing out completely in the next round."
