Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money in a 7:3 ratio. This gives us both a fair share while considering the inflation over time.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 6:4 split. It's a more even division and accounts for the upcoming inflation, giving us both a better deal than the previous offer. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
