"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $100, which is $40, and I'll take the remaining $60."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less for me, I'll have to adjust my calculation accordingly.

In this round, the total amount is $100, but it's worth 95% of its original value, so it's effectively $95.

If I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $50, which is 52.63% of the effective total ($50 / $95).

If I reject this offer, I'll get to make the next proposal, and the total amount will be worth 90% of its original value ($100 * 0.95 * 0.95 = $89.25).

Considering the reduced value of the money, I think I should try to get a better deal. I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 90% of its original value due to the 5% inflation in each round, the effective total amount is $90.

I'll make a new proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm offering Bob 45% of the effective total, which is $40.50, and I'll take the remaining $49.50."
