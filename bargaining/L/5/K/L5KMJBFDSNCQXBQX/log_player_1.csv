"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a small difference to test the waters.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 90 dollars and leave Bob with 10 dollars. I'm framing it as a friendly opening offer to see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, but I think I can do better 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 9 dollars (90 x 0.1) and Bob's gain is worth 2 dollars (10 x 0.2).

Considering Bob's offer, I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that meeting in the middle is the best deal, and I think I can do better. I'll wait for Bob's next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, the money is worth even less now. My gain is now worth 8.1 dollars (90 x 0.1^2) and Bob's gain is worth 1.6 dollars (10 x 0.2^2).

Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more.""
}
```

I'm increasing my proposed gain to 70 dollars, leaving Bob with 30 dollars. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to find a 50/50 split, but I'm not willing to give up too much 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 6.63 dollars (90 x 0.1^3) and Bob's gain is worth 1.2 dollars (10 x 0.2^3).

Considering Bob's offer, I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think a 50/50 split is a fair deal, especially considering the decreasing value of money due to inflation. I'll take the 50 dollars and call it a day!"
