"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn to respond!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, but I'm leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $50 is actually worth $45 (since 90% of $50 is $45).

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Too even, I'd like to try to get a bit more.""
}
```

I'm not ready to meet Bob in the middle just yet. I'll try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect, my gain is worth 90% of the previous round's gain, so I'll adjust my proposal accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slight edge, but I still want a bit more. Your turn to respond!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor, trying to squeeze a bit more out of the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a bit more, but I think this is a fair split. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $45 is actually worth $32.85 (since 72.9% of $45 is $32.85).

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to give up that much. I'd like to try to get a better deal.""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept a 55-45 split in Bob's favor, especially considering the reduced value of my gain due to inflation. I'll try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect, my gain is worth 72.9% of the previous round's gain, so I'll adjust my proposal accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you a larger share. Let's finalize the deal!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 40-60 split in Bob's favor, trying to be more conciliatory and end the negotiation on a positive note."
