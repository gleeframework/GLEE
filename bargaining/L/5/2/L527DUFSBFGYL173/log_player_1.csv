"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

I'm offering a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think I'll accept this offer. I'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","With inflation taking a toll, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60
}
```

I'm offering a slightly lower share for myself, hoping Bob will accept this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is dropping rapidly!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think I'll accept this offer. The game is getting tough, and I don't want to risk losing even more value in the next round."
