"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my offer for Round 1:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```
I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping he'll accept and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my share of $900,000 is now worth only $810,000, which is still a significant amount.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll take it. My share of $500,000 is still a decent amount, and I don't want to risk going into further rounds with decreasing value.

I accept the offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
