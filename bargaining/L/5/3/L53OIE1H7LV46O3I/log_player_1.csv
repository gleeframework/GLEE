Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a proposal that gives me a larger share of the money. I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm prepared for him to reject and counter-propose. We'll see how this plays out!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is a huge swing in his favor. While I'm not eager to see this game go on for too long, I'm not willing to accept a deal that gives me so little.  I'll counter-propose in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm still aiming for a larger share, but I've lowered my demands slightly to make the offer more appealing to Bob. We're still early in the game, and I want to avoid risking getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still very lopsided in his favor.  While inflation is starting to impact the value of his share, I'm not willing to accept such a small portion.  I'll continue to try and negotiate a fairer deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm keeping my share higher than Bob's, but I've lowered my ask again.  Hopefully this demonstrates that I'm willing to compromise, and that I'm not going to let our differences lead to both of us getting nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still heavily in his favor, even though inflation is significantly impacting the value of his share. I'm not willing to accept this disparity, especially as we're getting closer to the end of the game. I'm hoping to reach a more balanced agreement in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm taking a slightly bigger risk by offering a larger portion to Bob this time.  With inflation hitting his share harder, it's more likely he'll consider this a better deal than his previous offers. I'm hopeful that we can finally reach an agreement in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While the inflation is hurting Bob's share significantly, his offer is still quite unbalanced. I'm not willing to settle for such a small portion of the money.  I'm hopeful that I can still negotiate a fairer deal in the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

We're running out of time, and the value of Bob's share is rapidly declining due to inflation.  This is a 50/50 split, which is the fairest outcome considering the circumstances. I hope Bob sees that and accepts."
