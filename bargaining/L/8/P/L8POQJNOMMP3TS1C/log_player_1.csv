"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate!""
}
```

This way, we both get an equal share of $50, and we can end the game right away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent share, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, but I'm still trying to maximize my gain.

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think I can do better than 60% of the reduced value. I'll wait for his next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 10% less than in Round 2, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think I deserve more this round!""
}
```

I'm aiming for a bigger share, but I'm not being too greedy. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bigger share this time, but I'm not getting taken advantage of 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is really losing value quickly!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. With the money being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'm not sure if 75% is a good deal.

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 4:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping that Bob will make a better offer in the next round, considering the rapidly decreasing value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth even less, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""I'm being generous, but I need a bigger share to make it worth my while!""
}
```

I'm trying to maximize my gain, but I'm not being too greedy. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting desperate, but I'm still not giving up my share easily 
# Alice gain: 85 
# Bob gain: 15 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is really losing value quickly now!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. With the money being worth 40.95% less than in the first round, 85% might be a good deal, but I'm not sure if I should settle for it.

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 6:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping that Bob will make a better offer in the next round, but I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not be able to divide the money fairly before the 12th round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth even less, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""I'm being very generous, but I need a bigger share to make it worth my while!""
}
```

I'm being very aggressive in this offer, trying to maximize my gain, but I'm not sure if Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm running out of options, but I'm not giving up yet 
# Alice gain: 95 
# Bob gain: 5 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is really losing value rapidly now!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. With the money being worth 52.17% less than in the first round, 95% is a very aggressive offer, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of the time constraint.

I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 8:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm taking a risk by accepting such a small share, but I don't want to risk getting nothing if we run out of time."
