"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to be greedy and propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor.  I know the money will be worth less next round, so I want to get as much as possible now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though I get less than I hoped for, I'm accepting.  The inflation means the value of the money I would get if I reject is much lower, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the next round."
