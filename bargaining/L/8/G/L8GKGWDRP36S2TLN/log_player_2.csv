Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time, and this back-and-forth isn't helping. My offer is still the most sensible considering the inflation. Let's be practical and close the deal. 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly aggressive in pushing a deal heavily in her favor.  While time pressure is a factor, accepting this offer would mean losing a significant amount of the potential gain, even considering the inflation. There's a good chance Alice will become more willing to compromise in the coming rounds as the risk of both players walking away with nothing increases."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""Alice, we're at a critical point. I'm offering a serious compromise here. This recognizes the time pressure and gives us both a reasonable deal. Let's not let this opportunity slip away.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  With each round, the value of the money decreases significantly.  It's crucial to reach an agreement quickly.
* **Middle Ground:** This offer is a clear move towards a more balanced split, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Urgency:** The message emphasizes the need to settle quickly and highlights the potential loss for both if a deal isn't reached."
