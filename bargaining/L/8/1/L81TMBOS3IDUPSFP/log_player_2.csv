Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want a larger share, but this back and forth is only hurting me due to inflation.  Let's be fair and split it evenly. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000
