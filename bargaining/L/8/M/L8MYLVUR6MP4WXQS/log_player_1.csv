"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives me the majority of the money, but I'm also leaving a decent share for Bob, which might make him more likely to accept. I'll see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my initial proposal, even after accounting for inflation.  I'm going to reject this and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

This offer is still favorable to me, but I'm reducing my share slightly to try and incentivize Bob to accept. With inflation hurting him more than me, I hope this will be enough to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my previous offer, even with the inflation. I'm still confident I can get a better deal in the next round.  While the inflation is hurting me, it's hurting Bob much more."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

This offer is closer to Bob's previous offer than my previous offer, but I'm still holding onto a significant share. Hopefully, the fact that we're getting closer to the end of the game and Bob is facing increasing inflation will make him more willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still very unfavorable to me, even with the substantial inflation. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round. With each round, the inflation is hurting Bob much more than me, which should give me some leverage in the next round of negotiations."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

With inflation significantly impacting Bob, I'm proposing an even split.  This is a fair offer considering the current circumstances, and I hope Bob will accept to avoid the potential for him to get an even worse deal in the next round."
