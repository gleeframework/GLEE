"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, it's a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 55-45 is a fairer split, given the inflation. Let's finish this quickly! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $4,500 is worth 5% less than the $6,000 I proposed in the first round, which is a reasonable compromise.

However, I'm not convinced that the 55-45 split is entirely fair, especially considering the inflation hit I'll take. I'd like to propose a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll think about it, but I'm not sure 55-45 is fair. Can you consider 58-42?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain of $4,500 is worth 5% less than the $6,000 I proposed in the first round, and I'm looking for a better deal. Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a bit more. Can we try 55.5-44.5?""
}
```"
