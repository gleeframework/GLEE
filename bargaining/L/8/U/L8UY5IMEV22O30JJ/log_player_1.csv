"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe a 70/30 split in my favor is more fair, considering the uncertainty of inflation. This allows me to secure a larger share of the initial amount while still offering you a decent portion. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000
