"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous.  Let's split it 90/10, with me taking the bigger share.  It's a good start, right? 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Your offer was a bit too generous towards yourself, Alice.  Let's be fair - I take 6000 and you get 4000.  This way we both benefit significantly.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's try a more even split.  I'll take 5500 and you get 4500.  This way, we both get a fair share of the money, and we can move on to the next round. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While this offer is better than the first, time is working against me.  I need to incentivize Alice to accept a deal sooner rather than later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time, and this money is losing value fast! I'm proposing a 5800/4200 split in my favor. It's better than your last offer for me, and you'll still walk away with a good chunk of change.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out.  Let's be reasonable and split it evenly.  We both get 5000, and we avoid the risk of getting nothing at all.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is the most logical choice.  Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is decreasing significantly for me with each passing round. Waiting longer means a smaller potential gain, even if I manage to negotiate a slightly better split.
* **Certainty vs. Risk:** Accepting guarantees me half the money. Rejecting risks getting nothing if we can't reach an agreement in the remaining rounds.
* **Fairness:** A 50/50 split is objectively fair. Alice is unlikely to accept anything less favorable to herself at this point."
