Alice's offer:

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Alice. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor since you were unwilling to start with a fair offer.""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out and we're both losing money. I'm coming down to 52/48. Let's close this deal and both walk away with something substantial. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, it's still beneficial for me to hold out a little longer. The threat of inflation creates pressure on both of us to make a deal. I'm aiming to secure at least a 50/50 split, if not slightly in my favor."

Round 4

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm offering a 50.5/49.5 split.  Take it before inflation makes this whole exercise pointless! 
# Bob gain: 495000 
# Alice gain: 505000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While I was aiming for at least a 50/50 split, Alice's offer is very close and the impact of inflation is becoming significant. Accepting now guarantees a reasonably fair share, whereas continuing to hold out risks getting nothing if we fail to reach an agreement in time."
