"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can call it a day!""

This offer gives me 90% of the money, which is a very generous offer, but I'm sure Bob will see the wisdom in it."
