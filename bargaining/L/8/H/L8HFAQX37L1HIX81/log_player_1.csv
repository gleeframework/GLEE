"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In the first round, I'll aim to get a substantial share while keeping the game going. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

This way, I'll get 80% of the initial amount, and Bob will get 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to be more cautious. Bob's offer is a significant increase in his share, but I'll still consider it. Since I'll be getting 40% of the remaining amount, I'll accept this offer.
