"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. This way, we can both get something and have a starting point for further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started with an uneven split, I'm offering a more balanced proposal 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants to balance things out a bit.

I'll think about it... 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to keep negotiating. My gain of $4,000 is still a bit too low for my taste, considering the initial offer I made was $8,000. I'd like to aim for a higher share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the 10% decrease in the value of the money due to inflation.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm still looking for a bit more.""
}
```

I'm aiming for a slightly higher share, considering the decreased value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are starting to add up!

I'll think about it... 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that I'm getting a fair deal. Considering the decreasing value of the money, I'd like to aim for a higher share. $4,500 is still a bit too low for my taste. I'll keep pushing for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the continued decrease in the value of the money.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6500,
  ""bob_gain"": 3500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not willing to give up too much.""
}
```

I'm aiming for a slightly higher share, considering the decreasing value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, it's getting late in the game 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to make a deal!

I'll think about it... 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

Considering the significant decrease in the value of the money, I think a 50/50 split is a reasonable compromise. It's getting late in the game, and I'd rather have something than risk getting nothing."
