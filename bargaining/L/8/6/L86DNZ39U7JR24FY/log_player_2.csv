"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money 70/30. This proposal is fair considering the inflation rates. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer is decent, I'm going to try to get a better deal by rejecting. Since my money is losing value more quickly, I'm incentivized to try to get the deal done sooner rather than later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
