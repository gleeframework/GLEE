"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a pretty aggressive offer in the first round. I'm hoping Bob will be tempted by even a small share, given the potential for inflation to reduce the value of his share in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 927272.73 
# Bob gain: 72727.27 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, it's clear that Bob is taking a more aggressive stance.  Inflation is hurting me more than him, so accepting his offer is the most logical choice to avoid potential losses."
