Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is feeling the pressure of inflation, this offer is still significantly worse for me than what I proposed in Round 3. Bob is overestimating his negotiating position given that I am less affected by the inflation. I'll hold out for a better deal, but need to propose something quickly before my potential gains erode further."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 620000,
""bob_gain"": 380000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is a crucial round for both of us. I'm offering you a deal that's better than what inflation will leave on the table if you decline. Let's be realistic and close this deal.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  Both sides are feeling the pressure of inflation, but Bob is feeling it much more acutely. I need to acknowledge this while still aiming for a favorable outcome for myself.
* **Compromise (Slightly):** I've lowered my ask slightly from Round 3 to show a willingness to negotiate.
* **Urgency:**  My message emphasizes the need to reach an agreement now before inflation erodes the value even further."
