"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle, Alice.  Fair is fair. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

{
""alice_gain"": 850000,

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to give you a larger share, but this is my best offer. We need to reach an agreement soon before we both lose out. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is getting increasingly desperate as the rounds progress and the value of his potential gains decrease. While his offer isn't terrible, I'm aiming to secure at least 60% of the money. I'm willing to take a bigger risk to achieve a more favorable outcome."

Round 5

""alice_gain"": 750000,

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time. This is my final offer. Let's both get something before the value of the money drops even further. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  This is a tough decision, as time is running out. However, Bob is getting very desperate. He's now offering significantly less than his initial 50/50 split.  I think I can push my luck a little further and secure a better deal in the next round or two."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 650000,
""bob_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Bob, it seems like we both want this deal to happen. This is a compromise that benefits us both. Let's end this here.""
}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm lowering my demand slightly from the previous round to signal a willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still aiming for a significantly larger share than Bob's last offer. With only five rounds remaining, the pressure is mounting on both of us. This offer presents a reasonable compromise that could lead to a final agreement."

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're down to the wire. This is my final offer.  If we don't agree, we both lose everything. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:** This is a high-stakes gamble! Bob is clearly panicking, offering a much lower amount than before. He's trying to pressure me into accepting a bad deal with the threat of getting nothing.  I'm betting he'll become more rational in the next round and offer something closer to my previous offers. I have to stand my ground, even with the risk involved."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is it. We're down to the wire.  Take this offer, it's the best you'll get. Don't let's throw away a good deal!"" 
}
```

**Reasoning:** This is my final push. I'm lowering my demand significantly to show Bob I'm serious about closing a deal. This offer is a good compromise considering the circumstances and the risk of getting nothing. Bob is likely to see this as his last chance to salvage a decent share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is our last chance. I'm willing to take the biggest risk, but I believe in a fair outcome. If you don't accept, we lose everything. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  It's agonizing, but I have to accept. Bob is clearly playing hardball and willing to risk everything.  With only two rounds left, there's a very real chance he'll offer me even less next time, and I'll be left with nothing. It's a bitter pill to swallow, but getting $100,000 is better than getting $0."
