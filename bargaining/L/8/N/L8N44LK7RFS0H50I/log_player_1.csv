"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. It's a fair split, but I'm positioning myself for a good outcome in case the game goes on for a few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $5,000 is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $4,000. Bob's gain of $5,000 is still $5,000.

I'm not too happy with this offer, as I was hoping to get more than $4,000. I'll reject it.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, my goal is to get as much as possible now, while still leaving some room for future negotiations. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $3,000, but keeping $7,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $7,000 in the previous round is now worth 51.2% of its original value, which is $3,584. I'm not happy with this offer because it's even worse than my previous offer.

However, I'm starting to feel the pressure of time, and I don't want to get stuck with nothing. I'll accept Bob's offer.
