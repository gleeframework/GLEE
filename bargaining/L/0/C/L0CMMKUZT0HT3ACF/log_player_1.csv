Let's see if Bob takes my generous offer!  ðŸ˜‰"

# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm not going to let Bob take 90% of the money! I'll keep fighting for a fairer deal."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm dropping my share a bit, but I'm still aiming for a more equitable split.  Let's see if Bob is willing to compromise."

Bob's offer is getting increasingly unfair!  I'm not going to accept that.  I'll keep fighting for a better deal."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm dropping my share again, but I'm still hoping Bob will see that we both need to compromise.  I'm running out of rounds, so I need to find a way to get him to agree."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 6000

Bob's offer is still too one-sided. I need to make sure I get a bigger share.  I'm running out of time, so I need to be more strategic."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm willing to split the money evenly now. With inflation, the money is losing value, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all.  Hopefully, Bob will agree to this fair deal."
