"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I propose you take $4,000, leaving me with $6,000.  This seems like a fair split to me to start negotiations.  What do you think?

""alice_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer was a bit too much in your favor. I propose a split of $4,500 for me and $5,500 for you.  This takes into account the slight time pressure, but is still a reasonable starting point for negotiation.""

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems we are getting closer. I am willing to accept your previous offer of $5,500 for me and $4,500 for you. Let's close the deal before inflation eats further into our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
