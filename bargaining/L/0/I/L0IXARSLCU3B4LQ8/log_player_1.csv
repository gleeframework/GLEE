"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll take 90% and you get 10% - a fair starting point!""
}
```

This way, I get the majority of the money, but still leave Bob with a decent amount to make it worth his while to play along."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You took a bold start, let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","A more balanced offer from Bob! Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the offer carefully.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

It's a fair split, and I'm willing to compromise to move forward."
