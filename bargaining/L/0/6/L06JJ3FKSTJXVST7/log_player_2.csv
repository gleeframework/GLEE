Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The value is depreciating fast. I'll take $55, leaving you with $45.  This is the best you'll get, considering the time pressure. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
