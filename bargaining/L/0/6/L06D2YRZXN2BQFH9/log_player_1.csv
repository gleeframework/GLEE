"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can both walk away with $50 each."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, my gain of $40 is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $32.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal. I'd rather try to negotiate further. I'll reject the offer and make a new proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a bit low for me, Bob. I'll counter with 45.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, my gain of $45 is now worth 64% of its original value, which is $28.80.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly higher amount, Bob. Consider it!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45/55 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can both walk away with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm still not convinced it's fair 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, my gain of $45 is now worth 51.2% of its original value, which is $25.56.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal. The 42/58 split seems a bit too skewed towards Bob's favor. I'd rather try to negotiate further. I'll reject the offer and make a new proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's still a bit too low for me, Bob. I'll counter with 48.""

}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split again, hoping Bob will accept and we can both walk away with a decent amount."
