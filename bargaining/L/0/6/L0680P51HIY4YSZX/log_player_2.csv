"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""My turn Alice. How about a slight adjustment for a more even split?""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you want a more even split, Bob, but I'm losing money with every round. This is my counter-offer. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be fair.  A 50/50 split is the most logical solution. Don't you agree?""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this back and forth isn't helping anyone. I'm losing money fast. We need to settle this quickly. My offer stands. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting desperate, which means time is on my side. She's bluffing about her offer standing - she loses a significant chunk of her potential gains with every round.  I need to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm standing my ground. This split is fair considering the circumstances. Take it or leave it - time is running out for both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be reasonable, but you're leaving me with no choice. This is my final offer. Let's close this deal and move on. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:**  We are past the halfway point of the rounds.  The risk of walking away with nothing increases substantially if I reject this offer.
* **Diminishing Returns for Alice:** The inflation heavily impacts Alice.  While this offer seems similar to her earlier ones, it's likely a much bigger sacrifice for her now than it appears.
* **Uncertainty:**  There's no guarantee Alice will offer anything better, and she might even offer less in the next round. 

It's a tough decision, but accepting ensures I get something rather than risking everything for a slightly larger share."
