```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping to set a fair tone for the rest of the game."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'm hoping to negotiate more later! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to get a good chunk of the money early on!

I'll have to be careful, as the money is worth less with each passing round. Considering the inflation, my gain of 30 is equivalent to 24 in the first round, which is a relatively small amount.

I'll reject this offer for now and try to negotiate further.

  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much!""

# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value!

Considering the reduced value of the money, my gain of 20 is equivalent to only 10.4 in the first round, which is a relatively small amount.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. On one hand, it's a small share, but on the other hand, it's a relatively high percentage of the remaining money. I'm not sure if I should take it or try to negotiate further.

After some thought, I'll reject this offer.

Considering the massive decrease in value, my gain of 10 is equivalent to a mere 0.8 in the first round, which is an extremely small amount.

I'm not willing to accept such a tiny share, especially considering Bob's offer is still a whopping 90% of the remaining money. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
