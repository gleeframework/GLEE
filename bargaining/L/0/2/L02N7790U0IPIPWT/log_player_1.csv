Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I propose we split the money 60/40, with me getting 60. This seems fair, and leaves plenty of room for negotiation if you'd like to discuss a different split.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bigger share, but I think 70 is a bit too generous. I'll give you 70, but I'll take 30. Let's make a deal! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
