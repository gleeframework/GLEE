"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I propose a compromise where I take $60 and you take $40. This way, we both get a substantial amount, and you lose less to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
