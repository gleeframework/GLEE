"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's compromise. We both know we'll lose more money if we keep rejecting. I'm willing to give up some to keep the game moving. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than her first, she's still heavily favored. The inflation is hurting her faster than me, so I can afford to be a bit more patient.  There's a good chance I can get a better deal than this in the next few rounds."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Okay Alice, let's find a middle ground. This offer recognizes the time pressure we're both under.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a larger share. The pressure from inflation is mounting for both of us. This offer is a good balance between being fair and recognizing the shrinking pot."
