"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! I'm offering you a generous 20% of the total amount. Accept and we can finalize the deal.""
}
```

This way, I get 80% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer.  Let's both get a decent share. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 20% less for me, so I'd be getting 400000 * 0.8 = 320000.

Bob's offer is a 60/40 split, but since the money is worth less for me, I'd be getting 40% of the decreased amount, which is still a better deal for me than the 40% of the original amount.

I accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
