Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's a tough start. How about a more even split reflecting the long game? 65/35 seems fair. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Okay, Bob, let's try to meet in the middle.  I'm willing to go down to 60/40.  This should be a good deal for both of us, especially since the money is losing value with each round.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, the clock is ticking and we're both losing money.  55/45 is my final offer. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

It's getting risky, and while I'd prefer a slightly higher share, accepting this offer is the most logical move. Bob's offer is only slightly better than my last proposal, and the inflation rate is hurting me more than him. It's time to secure a deal."
