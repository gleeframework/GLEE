"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the money, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my share of 450,000 is now worth 360,000 in the first round's money. That's a decent offer, but I can do better. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll aim for a higher percentage to account for the decrease in value.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 48% of the money, and Bob gets 52%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings. Considering the drastic decrease in value of my share, I'll have to be cautious. Since Bob's offer is equal, it's a 50-50 split, which is a relatively fair proposal. I'll accept this offer.
