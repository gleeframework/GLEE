"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I take the lion's share, but you get a decent cut. We can adjust later if you're not happy.

# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer was heavily skewed in your favor.  Let's be more realistic.  I propose a 60/40 split. This is fair considering the inflation rate.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but a 60/40 split still feels too lopsided in your favor. Let's meet in the middle. This offer is fair given the inflation and ensures we both get a significant share. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is compromising, the deal is still heavily skewed in her favor, especially considering the faster rate of inflation affecting Bob's potential gains.  It's too early to accept a less-than-even split."
