"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start!""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to begin with, hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you most of it, but I'm not being too generous 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, as I would have to accept a relatively small share of the money. I'll reject this offer and try to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm still being generous""}

I'm trying to make a more balanced offer, giving Bob a slightly smaller share than I would have liked, but still leaving me with a decent amount. Let's see if Bob accepts this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking a risk, but I think I can get a better deal 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm tempted to reject this offer, but considering the decreasing value of money due to inflation, I think 75% of the remaining value might be a good deal. I'll take the risk and accept Bob's offer, hoping it's the best I can get."
