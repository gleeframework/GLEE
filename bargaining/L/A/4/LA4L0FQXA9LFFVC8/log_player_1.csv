Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I think this is a more balanced offer. The sooner we agree, the less you'll lose. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","This offer is tempting because it seems to acknowledge the inflation factor. However, Bob is still benefiting more in the long run. 

Let's see if we can negotiate a better deal.

# Bob gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is playing a waiting game, knowing the pressure is on me.  He's right that further delays reduce my gain, but this offer is still heavily skewed in his favor. I need to hold out for a bit longer.

Do you accept this offer?","This is getting dangerous. While Bob is correct about the inflation impact, his offers are getting worse for me. I need to accept a deal soon, or I risk getting even less.
