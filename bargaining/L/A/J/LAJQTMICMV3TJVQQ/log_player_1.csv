"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a reasonable split""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the money and leave 40% for Bob. I think this is a fair starting point, considering I'm the one making the first offer. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair.  50/50 split seems like a good place to start. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you halfway... kind of""
}
```

I'm making a slight concession, moving closer to Bob's proposed 50/50 split, but still trying to get a bit more for myself. Let's see how Bob reacts!"
