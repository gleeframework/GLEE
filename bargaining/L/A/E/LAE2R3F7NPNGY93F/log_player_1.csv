"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
``` 
 
I propose to keep 9000 for myself and give Bob 1000. This leaves some room for negotiation in the future rounds, while ensuring I secure the majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, accepting this offer guarantees me a significant share of the money. There's no guarantee that Bob will make a better offer in the future rounds, and the risk of getting nothing at the end is too high."
