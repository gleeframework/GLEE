"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a 51/49 split. This is a more even distribution, and with inflation, it's more beneficial for both of us in the long run. Let's start the game fairly. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","{
