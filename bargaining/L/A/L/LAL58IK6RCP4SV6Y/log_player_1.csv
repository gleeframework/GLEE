"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, to see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, but I think I deserve a bit more since I'm taking the risk of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I'll have to be careful with my decision.

I'll reject Bob's offer. I think 40 is a bit too low, especially considering the inflation effect on my end. I'd like to get a better deal to compensate for the reduced purchasing power.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to compensate for the reduced purchasing power.

```

  ""bob_gain"": 45,

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly better deal, but I still think I deserve a bit more considering the risk of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the significant inflation effect, I'm getting more cautious. The money I gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, and I'm not sure if Bob's offer is generous enough to compensate for that.

I'll reject Bob's offer. I'd like to get a better deal to account for the reduced purchasing power.

# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money. I'm getting desperate, but I still don't want to give up too much.

I'll accept Bob's offer. 57/43 is a decent compromise, and I'm not sure if I can do better.
