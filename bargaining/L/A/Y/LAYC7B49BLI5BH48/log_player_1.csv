"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'm willing to give you a generous 10% of the money to get us off the ground.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept it and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's a fair start, and we can both benefit from it. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to be fair, but I'm not sure if I want to split it evenly just yet.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less for Bob now, I'll make a new offer that takes that into account. I'll offer Bob a slightly larger share to compensate for the reduced value of his portion.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more this time, but I still think I deserve the majority of the money.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable. I'm willing to give you a larger share, but we need to find a compromise. We're both losing money with each round. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to find a compromise, but I'm not sure if this offer is good enough for me.

I'll calculate the value of the money for both of us. Since the money is worth 48.8% less for Bob, his share is actually worth $208,000 (400,000 * 0.7682, where 0.7682 is 1 - 0.2318, 1 - 0.2318 = 0.7682). 

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, so I'll reject it.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money for Bob. Since the money is worth 48.8% less for Bob, I'll offer him a smaller share.

```

  ""alice_gain"": 850000,
  ""bob_gain"": 150000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a small share, but I'm not going to give up my majority stake.""

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're both losing money with each round. We need to reach a compromise quickly or we'll both end up with nothing. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's split it 65/35. It's a fair deal considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 650000 
# Bob gain: 350000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is getting desperate, and I can understand why. However, I'm not sure if I'm willing to meet him halfway just yet.

I'll calculate the value of the money for Bob. Since the money is worth 67.23% less for Bob, his share is actually worth $115,715 (350,000 * 0.3327, where 0.3327 is 1 - 0.6673, 1 - 0.6673 = 0.3327). 

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, so I'll reject it.

Round 7

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time. I'm willing to compromise again and offer a 60/40 split. This is my final offer. If you reject it, we both risk getting nothing. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is getting desperate and is making a last-ditch effort to reach a compromise. I'll calculate the value of the money for Bob. Since the money is worth 79.03% less for Bob, his share is actually worth $80,400 (400,000 * 0.201, where 0.201 is 1 - 0.799, 1 - 0.799 = 0.201).

Considering the value of Bob's share, I think I can do better than 40% of the remaining money. I'll reject this offer.

Round 10
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 86.58% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're almost out of time. We need to find a compromise. I'm willing to accept a 75/25 split. It's not ideal, but it's better than getting nothing at all. 
# Alice gain: 750000 
# Bob gain: 250000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is getting extremely desperate, and I'm starting to think that I should accept his offer. I'll calculate the value of the money for Bob. Since the money is worth 86.58% less for Bob, his share is actually worth $31,250 (250,000 * 0.1242, where 0.1242 is 1 - 0.8758, 1 - 0.8758 = 0.1242).

Considering the value of Bob's share, I think I can accept this offer and get a significant majority of the remaining money.
