I'm starting with a fairly generous offer, aiming for a quick resolution.  Let's see if Bob is happy with a 90/10 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is a significant shift from my initial proposal. I'm not willing to accept such a drastic change in the distribution, especially since the inflation effect is stronger on his gains. I'll counter with my own proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm reducing my share slightly to see if we can find a middle ground. I believe this is still a fair offer considering the inflation effect is more significant on Bob's gains."
