60.0,40.0,"Let's be fair, Bob. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor to start. This leaves a good portion for you and avoids us losing money to inflation.",Alice,1,

45.0,55.0,"I think 60/40 is a bit too much in your favor, Alice. Considering the inflation, I propose 55/45. It's still a good deal for both of us, but more balanced.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
56.0,44.0,"Bob, let's be realistic. Inflation is hurting us both. I'm willing to compromise with 56/44. It's closer to my initial offer, but still gives you a decent share before our money shrinks further.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
48.0,52.0,"I see you're willing to compromise, Alice. Considering the inflation is affecting us both, I'll meet you closer to the middle. 52/48 is a fair split, and we should take it before the money loses more value.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
54.0,46.0,"Bob, we're running out of time!  I'm offering 54/46.  It's clear we both want a larger share, but holding out will only hurt us both in the long run. Let's agree now and get something!",Alice,5,
