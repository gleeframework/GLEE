Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60/40 is a bit too much in your favor, Alice. Considering the inflation, I propose 55/45. It's still a good deal for both of us, but more balanced. 
# Alice gain: 45

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
