"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

This is a classic bargaining game.  I'm starting with a very high offer for myself and a tiny amount for Bob. I'm hoping he'll be tempted to take it, but if not, I'll adjust my strategy in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much better than the previous round, but it's still not fair. I'm going to reject it and see if I can negotiate a better deal in the next round.  The inflation is going to start impacting me more and more as the game progresses, so I need to be careful about how much I'm willing to concede."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000} 
```

I'm going to offer Bob a more equitable split this time. Inflation is starting to bite, and I need to be more reasonable.  I'm going to aim for a 60/40 split, hoping that Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting again. Even though inflation is hitting me hard now, I'm still not willing to settle for such a low offer. I believe I can get a better deal in the next round. Bob's offer is becoming increasingly unfair, but he is also under pressure from inflation, so we'll see how the next round goes."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a slightly higher share this time,  hoping to find a compromise.  The inflation is really starting to affect my potential gains, and I need to find a way to reach an agreement before it's too late. I'm aiming for a 45/55 split, a more balanced proposition than the previous round."
