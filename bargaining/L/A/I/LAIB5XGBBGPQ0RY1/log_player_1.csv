I'm starting with a generous offer, hoping to secure a quick agreement. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much fairer than mine, but I'm not willing to accept it just yet.  I still think I can get a better deal, especially with the inflation impacting the money I gain. Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm still hoping for a good split, but with inflation, I need to adjust my offer.  I'm going to offer 8000 for myself and 2000 for Bob.  Let's see if this is more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse, and with the inflation hitting my gains harder, I need to push for a better deal. I'm not going to accept this yet, hoping for a more favorable offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}

With each round, the inflation is making my gains less, so I need to adjust my strategy. I'm going to offer a slightly lower amount for myself, hoping to entice Bob into accepting this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

This offer from Bob is significantly worse for me than my previous offer.  I'm not going to give in to this. I'm hoping for a more equitable offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to try one more time to make a deal. This offer is getting closer to Bob's previous offer,  and I'm hoping that the prospect of securing some money before the inflation hits us both too hard will be appealing to him."

# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offers are getting increasingly worse, and I'm not willing to accept this. I'm hoping that he'll realize we're both losing more with each passing round, and he'll be willing to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm going for a 50/50 split. The inflation is hitting us both hard, and we're nearing the end of the game.  I think this is the fairest option for both of us at this point."
