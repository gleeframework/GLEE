"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $80 and Bob gets $20. This is a relatively fair split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept to avoid wasting time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take a slightly biased split, but still generous. Your turn next! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 5% less than the original $80 I proposed. 

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to accept a smaller share. I'll think carefully about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
