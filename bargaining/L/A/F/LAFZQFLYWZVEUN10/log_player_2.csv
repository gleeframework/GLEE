Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger share to offset the losses from the previous round. Let's split it closer to 60/40. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer, Bob. We're both losing money with every passing round. Let's split it evenly and avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, accepting is the most logical choice for Bob. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  The value of Bob's potential gain is decreasing significantly with each round due to inflation. Waiting any longer will only result in a worse deal for him.
* **Alice's Final Offer:**  Alice has stated this is her final offer. There's no guarantee she'll offer an even split in future rounds, and it's highly likely she'll push for a larger share for herself.
* **Certainty vs. Risk:** Accepting guarantees Bob 5000 ""inflated dollars"". Rejecting means risking an even worse outcome in the hopes of a slightly better, but highly uncertain, outcome.

While accepting a 50/50 split after initially aiming for more might feel disappointing, it's the most rational decision considering the game's rules and the rapidly decreasing value of the potential winnings for Bob."
