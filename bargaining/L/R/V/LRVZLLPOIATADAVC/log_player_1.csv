"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

This offer is designed to be extremely unfair to Bob, but it sets the stage for a possible negotiation. If Bob rejects it, he knows that I'm willing to be aggressive, and he might be more inclined to compromise in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I initially aimed for a larger share,  a 50/50 split is a fair and reasonable outcome. There's a good chance we'll run out of rounds if I keep rejecting offers, so accepting this ensures we both get something."
