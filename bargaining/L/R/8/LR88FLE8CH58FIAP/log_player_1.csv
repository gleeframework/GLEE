"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, it's a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 equally, with each of us getting $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fairer to give me a bit more, as I'm taking on the risk of you rejecting my offer. Let's see if we can work this out. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'm willing to consider it. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives Bob a 2:1 ratio. I'd like to make a new proposal that takes into account the reduced value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think 2:1 is too extreme. Let's try to find a middle ground.""}

I'm proposing a slightly more skewed ratio, but still trying to find a compromise."
