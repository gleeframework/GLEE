"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
```

I propose a 60/40 split in my favor, as I am the one making the initial offer. I believe this is a fair starting point, and I hope Bob will see it as such."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation factor makes accepting this offer the most sensible option.  It's better to get 4500 now than risk getting less in a future round."
