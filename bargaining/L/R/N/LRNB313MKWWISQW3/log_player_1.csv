"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start, no need to negotiate too hard""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to begin with, to see if Bob is interested in accepting the offer and ending the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than an even split.  I'm offering you $4000, and I'll take the rest.  Let's get this done before the money starts to lose too much value. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $4000 in this round is actually worth less than my gain of $5000 in the previous round. I'm not sure if I'm getting the best deal, but I don't want to risk waiting for another round and losing more value. I'll accept Bob's offer for now.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
