"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and it gives us both a decent chunk of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bigger share, but not that big! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the reduced value of the money, but I'm willing to consider Bob's offer.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll take the 70% and Bob can have the remaining 30%. It's not the best deal, but it's better than going to the next round and risking getting even less."
