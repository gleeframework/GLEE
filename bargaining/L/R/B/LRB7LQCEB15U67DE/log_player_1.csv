"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

This is a 50/50 split, which seems fair to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of $4000 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain of $6000 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, as it seems Bob is trying to get a larger share. I'll reject it.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation is now affecting the money even more, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a better share.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

This way, I'm trying to get a slightly larger share, but still leaving room for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value!

Considering the adjusted values, my gain of $3000 is worth about 30% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain of $7000 is worth about 70% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, as it seems Bob is trying to get a significantly larger share. I'll reject it.

```
