Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but 80/20 is the best I can do this round. We're both losing money with each passing round! 
# Bob gain: 20 
# Alice gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm taking a significant hit from inflation with each round.  Meet me in the middle at 60/40 and let's be done with this.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer.  We're both losing out with each round. Let's agree on this and end this before it's too late! 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer of $30 is better than risking getting nothing in the remaining rounds. The longer the game goes on, the more I lose to inflation.
