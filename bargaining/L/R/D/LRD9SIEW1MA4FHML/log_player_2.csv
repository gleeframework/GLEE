Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}
I'm rejecting the offer because, even though the money is worth 46.86% less for me now, I think I can still get a slightly better deal in the next round. Alice's offer of 3500 is less than what I offered her in the previous round, and I'm not willing to settle for that yet. However, I need to be cautious since the value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me, and I don't have many rounds left to negotiate. I'll try to make a more reasonable offer in the next round to reach an agreement."

# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
I'm accepting the offer because, considering the money is worth 56.95% less for me now, I think this is the best deal I can get. Alice's offer of 3000 is still a significant amount, and I don't want to risk losing everything by rejecting this offer and going to the next round. The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me, and I don't have many rounds left to negotiate. I'll take the 3000 and end the game here."
