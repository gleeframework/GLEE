"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

This is my initial offer. I'm taking the majority share, but I'm leaving Bob a small amount to hopefully incentivize him to accept rather than risk getting nothing in a later round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a fair split, and while I would have preferred my original offer, I risk getting nothing if I reject and Bob makes a counter-offer in the next round."
