"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further!""
}
```

This is a fair and straightforward offer, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it to avoid further negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'm not as eager to accept a smaller share.

I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like a bit more, considering the reduced value of money.""
}
```"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreased worth of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I still think 42% is a fair cut.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth significantly less for me, I'm getting a bit desperate to get a deal done. However, I still think I can do better than 300,000.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like a bit more, considering the extreme inflation.""
}

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth even less, I'll try to get as much as I can. I'll make a new offer that's even more aggressive.
