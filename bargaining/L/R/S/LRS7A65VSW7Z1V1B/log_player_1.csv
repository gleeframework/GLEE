I'm taking a pretty big chunk, but I figure Bob will be happy with anything at this point.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being greedy! I'll take my chances in the next round.  I'm sure I can do better than that."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but still keeping a large share.  I think Bob might be getting a little desperate now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Ok, Bob is getting really greedy! I'm down to only 48.8% of what I was worth in the first round, and Bob is still getting 80% of the pie.  I'm not sure how much longer I can hold out, but I think I'll accept this offer."
