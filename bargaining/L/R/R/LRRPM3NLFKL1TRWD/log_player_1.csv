I propose a division of $9,000 for me and $1,000 for Bob. Since it's the first round, I am confident in getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is less than his previous offer, but with inflation, it's likely worth more to him. I'm confident this offer is attractive enough for him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Bob's offer, while lower for me than his offer in round 2,  is still a decent deal for me, considering the inflation. Accepting this offer is the best strategy at this point, as the next round will likely lead to a worse deal for me due to further inflation."
