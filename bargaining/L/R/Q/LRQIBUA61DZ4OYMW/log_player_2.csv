Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out for both of us. This is my final offer - take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While this offer is worse than the 50/50 split Bob initially proposed, it's still a decent gain for Bob, especially considering the inflation factor. Each round further reduces the value of the money, making it more risky to continue rejecting offers.  The offer also has a ""take it or leave it"" element from Alice, suggesting she's unlikely to budge further. Accepting guarantees Bob a significant sum, while rejecting could lead to a smaller gain, or even no gain at all."
