"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm not going to accept this offer.  1000 dollars is not a good deal for me. I'm going to see if I can get a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 9000, ""alice_gain"": 1000}
``` 
I'm offering Alice $1000 and keeping $9000 for myself.  This seems like a fair deal given the risk of inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm still rejecting this offer. Even with inflation, 4000 dollars is not enough for me, especially since Alice is getting a much larger share. I'll try to make a better deal next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm offering Alice $4000 and keeping $6000 for myself. This feels more fair given the inflation, and I hope she accepts it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'm accepting this offer.  With inflation, the money I'm getting is worth less than the original $1000, but it's better than getting nothing. It's a 50/50 split, and I'm not sure I can do better."
