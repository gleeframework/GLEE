"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. I'm hoping this is a good starting point for the negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You got lucky last round, try to do better this time 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, that's a tough one!

Considering the inflation, the actual values are:
Alice gain: $3,000 / 0.95 = $3,157.89
Bob gain: $7,000 / 0.95 = $7,368.42

I don't think I can do better than this offer, so I'll accept it.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
