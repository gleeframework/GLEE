Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close to the end. Let's try to be reasonable here. I'm willing to take 475,000, which leaves you with 525,000. This is a good deal for both of us, and it's getting late in the game.  What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 525000 
# Bob gain: 475000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 6 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:**  The value of the money is decreasing significantly with each round. Waiting longer means a smaller reward, even if a slightly better offer arises.
* **Time Pressure:**  With only 6 rounds remaining, the risk of walking away with nothing increases substantially if we continue to reject offers. 
* **Reasonable Offer:** Bob's offer isn't dramatically unfair. Accepting secures a reasonable sum, even with the inflation impact, rather than risking a total loss."
