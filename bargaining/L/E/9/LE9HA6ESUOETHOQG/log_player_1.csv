Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was heavily skewed in your favor. I'm proposing a more balanced 55/45 split.  Let's settle this quickly before inflation eats away at our gains. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500
