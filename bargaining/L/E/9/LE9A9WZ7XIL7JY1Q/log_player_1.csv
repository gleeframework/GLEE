I've attached a message saying ""Let's be fair"" to convey a sense of reasonableness and encourage Bob to accept the offer. The ball is now in Bob's court to decide whether to accept or proceed to the next round."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering inflation will hit me harder. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI've decided to reject Bob's offer. Although Bob's message tries to justify the split by mentioning the impact of inflation, I believe I can negotiate a better deal considering the money is worth the same to me across rounds. I'll proceed to the next round to make a new proposal."

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. I'm willing to take a smaller share to avoid further inflation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI've decided to reject Bob's offer. Despite Bob's message framing this as their final offer and emphasizing their willingness to take a smaller share to avoid further inflation, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal. The fact that the money is worth the same to me across rounds gives me an advantage in negotiations. I'll proceed to the next round to make a new proposal, hoping to capitalize on Bob's increasing urgency due to inflation.\n\n###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}"

I've attached a message saying ""Last chance before I take more"" to convey a sense of urgency and pressure Bob into accepting the deal. Given the significant impact of inflation on Bob's share, I'm trying to create a scenario where Bob feels compelled to accept this offer rather than risk losing even more value in future rounds.\n\n###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 570000, ""bob_gain"": 430000, ""message"": ""Last chance before I take more""}"
