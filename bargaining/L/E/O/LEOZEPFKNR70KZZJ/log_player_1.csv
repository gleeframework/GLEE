"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to begin with, hoping to set a fair tone for the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already biting! With the money worth 10% less, I'm not as eager to accept a smaller share.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 36,
  ""bob_gain"": 64,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I need a fair deal!""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly larger share to Bob, but I'm still hoping to get a decent amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I'm getting desperate! 
# Alice gain: 28 
# Bob gain: 72 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value! With the money worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'm getting worried that I'll end up with nothing if I don't get a good deal soon.

However, I'm not ready to accept Bob's offer just yet. I think I can do better than 28%. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now, so I'll have to be more aggressive in my proposal. Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 32,
  ""bob_gain"": 68,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate too, but I need a better deal than that!""
}
```

I'm increasing my share to 32, hoping that Bob will see the value in a slightly more equal split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to the end, but I'll give you a slightly better deal this time! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really eating away at the money's value! With the money worth 40.95% less than in the first round, I'm starting to get really worried that I'll end up with nothing.

However, I'm not ready to accept Bob's offer just yet. 20% is a pretty small share, and I think I can do better. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now, so I'll have to be more aggressive in my proposal. Here's my offer for Round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 24,
  ""bob_gain"": 76,
  ""message"": ""I'm running out of time, but I need a better deal than 20%! Can we meet in the middle?""
}
```

I'm increasing my share to 24, hoping that Bob will see the value in a slightly more equal split. I'm also trying to appeal to his sense of fairness by suggesting we meet in the middle."
