"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $4000 and keep $6000 for myself. Since Bob loses more value with each passing round due to the higher inflation rate affecting him, I believe this initial offer should be enticing enough for him to consider accepting early on, minimizing the loss for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can be fair and both get a good amount. Let's take this offer. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject Bob's offer because, despite the inflation, accepting $4000, which is now worth 5% less, doesn't seem beneficial compared to the potential gain if I can negotiate a better split in the next round. The significant disparity in inflation rates between us means that Bob is under more pressure to conclude the game sooner, which could lead to a more favorable offer for me in subsequent rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, this is a good deal""}\n\nGiven the increasing impact of inflation, particularly on Bob's side, I'm adjusting my offer to make it slightly more appealing for him to accept now rather than risking further devaluation. By proposing a split of $5500 for myself and $4500 for Bob, I'm aiming to find a middle ground that acknowledges the urgency for both of us to finalize the deal but still leans in my favor due to Bob's higher inflation rate."
