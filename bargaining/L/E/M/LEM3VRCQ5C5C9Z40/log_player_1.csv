I'm going for a big chunk of the money, but I'm also willing to give Bob something.  Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

I'm not going to accept this offer.  I'm not going to let Bob take 90% of the money!  I'll take my chances in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000} 
```

I'm still going for a large share, but I'm willing to give Bob a little more this time to see if he'll accept.  I need to keep in mind the inflation though.  Let's see if this works!"
