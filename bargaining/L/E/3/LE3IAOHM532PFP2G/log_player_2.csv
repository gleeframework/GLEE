Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to counter Alice's offer and see if she'll accept a more even split."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

With inflation kicking in, this seems like a fair deal for both of us. Let's split it evenly!"
