"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a small amount to start, but I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal in future rounds!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is 20% of the original amount, in the hopes that I can negotiate a better deal in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the attempt at negotiation, but I believe we can find a more equitable solution. Here's a proposal that might be more acceptable to both of us. 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

Considering Bob's proposal, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that this offer is more equitable, and I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth 5% less for me, so I'll aim to get a larger share. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8500,
  ""bob_gain"": 1500,
  ""message"": ""I'm increasing my offer, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Don't be too greedy, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share this time, but I'm hoping to make up for it with the lower value of the money due to inflation."
