Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 70/30 is a more reasonable split, given the initial offer was too generous for me. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, the money I gain is now worth 5% less than the initial $100, which is $95. The money Bob gains is worth 10% less than the initial $100, which is $90.

Here's my response to Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think a 30-70 split is too unfavorable for me, considering the initial offer was already a 60-40 split. I'd like to propose a new offer."
