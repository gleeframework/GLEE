Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm being more than fair with 55/45, especially considering the inflation. Take it before it gets worse for you. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI think it's time to cut my losses and accept the offer. The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain, and 4500 is better than risking another round and possibly getting an even worse deal."
