"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
``` 
 
This offer is a reasonable starting point. It's a fair split, and gives Bob a little more than Alice to incentivize him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though my share is less due to inflation, it's still a decent gain. Accepting this offer means I get something, while rejecting could lead to a worse outcome in the next round."
