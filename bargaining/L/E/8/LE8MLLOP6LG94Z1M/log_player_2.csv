"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair split, taking most of the money since I'm the one making the offer. What do you say, Bob? 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is a classic negotiation game with an interesting twist. I'm not going to accept a 10% share right off the bat. Let's see if I can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable. I propose a 45/55 split in my favor. This ensures we both get a significant share and avoids the risk of losing everything as rounds progress.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. You're losing a lot more value with each round than I am. A 60/40 split is a reasonable compromise.  Let's end this game before the money melts away completely. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a better split, the inflation factor is making this offer increasingly attractive. I can't afford to be too stubborn and risk losing everything."
