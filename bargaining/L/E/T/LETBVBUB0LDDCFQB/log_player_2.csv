Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm not buying it 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to wear me down, knowing that inflation hurts me more than her. I need to hold my ground. While the offer is getting worse, I still believe I have leverage as we are getting closer to the deadline and Alice gets nothing if we don't agree."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Okay, let's be reasonable. A 50/50 split is the fairest and quickest way to end this.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing hardball and knows time is on her side. To avoid the risk of getting nothing in the later rounds, offering a 50/50 split is the safest bet now.  It emphasizes fairness and presents a clean resolution, which might appeal to Alice, especially since she was initially aiming for a 60/40 split."
