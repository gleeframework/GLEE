"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

This offer gives me 80% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob gets the remaining 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustments, my gain of $400,000 is worth 80% of the original $1,000,000, and Bob's gain of $600,000 is worth 60% of the original $1,000,000.

I accept this offer.
