**Reasoning:**

The game is heavily rigged against Bob due to the inflation mechanic. While getting only 44% of the initial sum isn't ideal, it's better than getting nothing if the negotiations fail. The rounds are progressing quickly and Alice seems unwilling to budge much. Accepting now secures Bob a decent sum, even if devalued, rather than risking a complete loss."
