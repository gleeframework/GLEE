"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, it's a fair start! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer because I know inflation is a factor.  Even though it seems fair now, my share will be worth less in the next round.  I'll try to get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think it's fair for me to get a slightly bigger share since I'll be taking the risk of inflation in the next round.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share now to avoid a bigger hit from inflation later. Your turn to decide! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Even though my share is worth less due to inflation, I'll accept this offer.  It's better than risking another round and potentially getting an even smaller share.  It's time to cut my losses and take what I can get."
