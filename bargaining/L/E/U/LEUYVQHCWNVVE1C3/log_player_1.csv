"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $100, and Bob gets 20%. I'm framing it as a fair starting point, hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started high, now it's my turn to be greedy! 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is being quite aggressive with his proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think it's too one-sided. I'd like to negotiate further to get a more balanced split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. I'll propose a more modest gain for myself, considering the reduced value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, let's find a middle ground.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 40% gain for myself and 60% for Bob, hoping this will be more acceptable to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging, it's my turn to be greedy again! 
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob is really pushing his luck now!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. His proposal is extremely one-sided, and I'm not willing to accept such a small gain for myself, especially considering the significant decrease in the value of the money due to inflation. I'd like to try to negotiate further to get a more reasonable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","It seems like Bob is trying to squeeze every last penny out of me!

Since the money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. I'll propose a very low gain for myself, hoping Bob will see the value in accepting a slightly better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 1,
  ""bob_gain"": 99,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, but I'd rather get something than nothing.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 1% gain for myself and 99% for Bob, hoping that Bob will take pity on me and accept this extremely lopsided deal."
