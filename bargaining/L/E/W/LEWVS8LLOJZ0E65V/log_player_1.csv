"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose to take $9000 and give Bob $1000. Since the money loses value faster for you, I think it's fair to take a larger share.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, I'm not confident in my ability to get a better deal in the coming rounds.  Accepting this offer means we both get something."
