Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out for both of us. This is my final offer.  It's still a good deal for you, and I need to secure my share before inflation eats it away further. 
# Bob gain: 490000 
# Alice gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
