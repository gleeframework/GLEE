"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'm going to start by offering Bob a small share (100,000$) and keeping the majority for myself. It's risky, but hopefully, he'll see the value in taking something now rather than waiting and risking getting even less later due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to keep more, the inflation is a real risk. Accepting a 50/50 split ensures I get a significant amount of money, even with the inflation, rather than risking getting even less in the future."
