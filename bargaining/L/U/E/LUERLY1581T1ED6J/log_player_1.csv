"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm starting with a fairly generous offer, hoping to secure a quick win. I'm giving Bob a small portion, but still enough to incentivize him to accept.  Let's see if he bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is worse than my initial proposal, even considering the inflation. I'm not willing to settle for less, especially since I know he's facing a higher inflation rate. I'm going to counter with a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8500, ""bob_gain"": 1500}
```

I'm going to try to split the difference. I'll offer Bob a bit more than his last offer, but still keep a larger share for myself. I believe this will be enough to sway him, especially since he's facing a higher inflation rate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7500 
# Bob gain: 2500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While Bob's offer is worse than my initial offer, it's better than the last round. I'm facing a significant inflation rate, and it's better to secure a deal now than risk getting a worse offer in the next round."
