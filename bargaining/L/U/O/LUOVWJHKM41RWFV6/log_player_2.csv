Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

**Reasoning:** While time is definitely a factor, accepting this offer would mean losing a significant chunk of the initial amount due to inflation. It's worth taking a calculated risk and seeing if Alice is willing to negotiate further."
