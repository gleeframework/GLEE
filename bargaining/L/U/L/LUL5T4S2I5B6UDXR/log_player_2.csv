"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split.  I'll take the lion's share, but you still get a decent amount.  Accept this, and we both win. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While it's tempting to accept, even though it's not a fair split, it's better to reject this offer. There are 12 rounds, and the money's value is going to decline for Alice.  By rejecting, Bob can force Alice to make a more favorable proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable. I'm willing to split the money more evenly, but I need a larger share to make this worthwhile for me.  Accept this, and we can avoid the risks of further rounds.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to be flexible, but I need more than that. This offer is closer to what I believe is a fair split, considering the risks of continued rounds. Let's reach an agreement now. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice is still offering more than half the money. Bob has a much higher chance of getting a better deal if he continues to reject and negotiate. Even though the money is losing value, it's still declining faster for Alice, making her more likely to concede in the next few rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a significant share to make this worthwhile.  Let's find a middle ground. Accept this, and we can both walk away with something substantial.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're getting closer.  I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I need to ensure I receive enough as well.  Let's avoid the risk of further rounds and settle on this split. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

While it's tempting to accept as the offer is more even, it's still not a fair split considering the inflation rate is hitting Alice harder.  Bob can leverage this to push for a more favorable deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slight concession, but I need to ensure I receive a fair share of the remaining value. Let's find a compromise before the inflation eats away at our potential gains.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is getting ridiculous.  Let's cut our losses and split the money evenly. We both get something, and we can avoid the risk of getting nothing.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

This is a good offer, considering the inflation.  Bob has a decent amount and it's better to accept before further rounds risk a total loss."
