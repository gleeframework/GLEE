  ""alice_gain"": 7500,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60/40 split, a more generous offer than Alice's initial proposal. This way, you get a decent share while I still get a majority. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
