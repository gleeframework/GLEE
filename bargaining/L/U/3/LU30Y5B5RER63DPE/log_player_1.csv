"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

This is a fair split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it to end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm still getting a decent amount. However, the money Bob gains is worth 10% less, which makes his offer seem more attractive.

I'll decide to accept this offer.
