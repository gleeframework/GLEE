"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 60%, you get 40%. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} \n\nI'll reject this offer. I think I can get a better deal in the next round. Since the money is worth 20% less for Alice in each subsequent round, she may be more willing to compromise to avoid further losses. I'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a more reasonable split. You lose 20% of the value each round, so it's better to settle now.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it down the middle. Inflation is biting, but I'm willing to compromise to avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll accept this offer. Since the money is worth the same for me in every round, getting 50% is a good deal. Considering Alice is losing value each round, I think she's made a reasonable compromise to avoid further losses. There's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in the next round, so I'll settle for this.
