"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}

This means I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is starting to bite!

I'll think carefully... With the money worth 10% less, my gain of $5,000 is equivalent to $4,500 in the first round's value. Bob's gain of $5,000 is equivalent to $4,750 in the first round's value.

Considering this, I'll accept Bob's offer.
