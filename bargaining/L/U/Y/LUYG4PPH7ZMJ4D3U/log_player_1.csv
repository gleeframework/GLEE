"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This offer ensures that you get the most possible money in the first round, even with the risk of inflation.  It's highly likely Bob will accept, as even a single dollar is better than nothing. Let's see what Bob chooses!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While it would be tempting to try and squeeze more out of Bob, the risk of inflation is too high.  The potential loss of value outweighs the possible gain from playing another round.  A 50/50 split ensures I get a decent amount of money, even with inflation."
