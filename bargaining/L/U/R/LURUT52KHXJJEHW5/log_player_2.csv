"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a fair split, considering you'll lose more value than me in the next round. Let's end this quickly. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While Alice's offer is tempting, it's not in my best interest to accept it. I can potentially get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think this is a fairer split.  Since we both lose money over time, let's aim for a more even distribution. This is my final offer, and if you reject it, you'll have to make the next proposal.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I still think this split is closer to fair given the inflation rates. Let's end this here. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer a more even split, it's becoming increasingly risky to keep rejecting offers.  The inflation is hurting me more than Alice, and I don't want to risk getting a worse deal in the next round."
