"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob.  Let's split it 999000 to 1000.  You get a taste of the money, and I get the bulk.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This is a terrible deal for Bob. Even though 1,000$ is something, the inflation will make that amount worthless in a few rounds. It is better to reject and see what Alice offers next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than Alice's proposal. This is a more fair split, as we both get a significant share.  What do you think?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's split it 900000 to 100000. It's a fairer split than your last offer, and still gives you a significant share. Let's avoid further inflation and finalize this. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While it's still a lopsided deal, it's a significant improvement from the previous offer.  Inflation will continue to eat away at the value of the money, and  getting 100,000 now is better than risking getting nothing later."
