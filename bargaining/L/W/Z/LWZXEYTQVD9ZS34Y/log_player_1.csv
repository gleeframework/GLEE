"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly, considering the inflation!""}\n\nIn this offer, I propose that I receive $60 and Bob receives $40. The message to Bob is ""Let's split fairly, considering the inflation!"" to emphasize the impact of inflation on the value of money in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better with a slightly more even split.  I'll accept a 55/45 split in your favor to avoid further inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject Bob's offer because he's trying to give me $45, which is less than what I offered myself in the first round ($60). Since the money is worth the same to me in this round as it was in the first round, I have no incentive to accept a worse offer. I'll proceed to the next round to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, my patience is wearing thin.""}\n\nIn this offer, I propose that I receive $57 and Bob receives $43. The message to Bob is ""Considering the inflation, my patience is wearing thin"" to indicate that I'm getting less willing to compromise as the rounds go on and inflation affects the value of the money. I've also slightly reduced my initial offer to try to find a middle ground, but I'm still aiming to get the better end of the deal."
