Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, the inflation is eating away your share 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a tough spot. Let's analyze:

* **The Deal:** Alice offers me $42 (effectively worth even less due to inflation) while she gets $58. This is far from ideal.
* **The Pressure:** Alice is using the inflation against me, and she's right. Every round makes my potential gains less appealing.
* **Future Rounds:** If I reject this, there's no guarantee I can get her to agree to a better deal. If she keeps lowballing, the inflation will make even accepting a bad offer pointless.

It's a gamble either way. I need to decide if I'm willing to risk getting even less in the hopes of a better deal later. 

**My Decision:**

This is a tough one, but I'll take the risk. 

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm hoping that by rejecting this offer, I can signal to Alice that I'm serious about getting a fairer deal. I'm betting that she might be more willing to negotiate in later rounds as the game goes on. However, this is a risky strategy because if she doesn't budge, I'm in for a worse outcome as inflation eats away at my potential gains."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, this isn't sustainable. Let's be reasonable and split it evenly.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to make a strong stand and go for a 50/50 split. Here's why:

* **Signaling:**  Alice needs to understand I'm serious. The constantly decreasing value means I'm increasingly willing to walk away with nothing if she doesn't negotiate fairly.
* **Simplicity:** A 50/50 split is the easiest to agree on. It eliminates the need for complex calculations and potential disagreements over fairness.
* **Time Pressure:**  The longer this goes on, the worse it gets for me. A quick resolution is becoming crucial.

This is a high-risk, high-reward strategy.  Alice might be stubborn, but by now, she should realize that my willingness to accept a deal on her terms is diminishing rapidly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You should have taken one of my previous offers, now I'm taking even more 
# Bob gain: 41 
# Alice gain: 59 
Do you accept this offer?","I have no choice. 

```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly taking advantage of the situation. She knows the longer this goes on, the worse it gets for me. While $41 (with significant inflation) is a terrible outcome, rejecting this offer risks getting even less in future rounds.  It's a bitter pill to swallow, but at this point, cutting my losses is the least damaging option."
