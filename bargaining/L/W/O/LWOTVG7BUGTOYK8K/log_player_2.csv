Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, I'll make a counteroffer. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a higher share. Here's my offer:

# Alice gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of 20$ is equivalent to 25.63$ in the first round, which is a relatively small share. I'll accept Alice's offer this time.
