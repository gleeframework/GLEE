"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI'll offer Bob $4000 and take $6000 for myself, with a message suggesting a fair split. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn.  I'll take a bit more this time since the value is going down. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the value of money is decreasing due to inflation, I need to be strategic about my decision. Considering Bob's offer of $4500 for me and $5500 for himself, and taking into account that the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'll have to reject the offer. I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the next round.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nLet's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll consider the decreasing value of money due to inflation and try to find a mutually acceptable division. Since Bob's previous offer was not satisfactory, I'll make a counteroffer that is slightly more favorable to myself while still being reasonable for Bob.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's find a middle ground""}\n\n###\n\nI'll offer Bob $4200 and take $5800 for myself, with a message emphasizing the need to find a middle ground considering the inflation. Let's see if Bob accepts this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is getting ridiculous. Let's just split it evenly and end this. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the significant decrease in the value of money due to inflation, a 50/50 split seems reasonable at this point. The money I gain is now worth 14.26% less than in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less. Given the decreasing value and the risk of further losses if we continue negotiating, I'll accept Bob's offer of an even split.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nLet's end the game with a mutually acceptable agreement!"
