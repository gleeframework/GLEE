Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a very unequal split.  I figure Bob will be desperate to take anything rather than risk getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a much fairer offer, and it's better than risking getting nothing in the remaining rounds."
