"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects the potential losses we both face from inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While Alice's offer is initially appealing,  it's important to consider the inflation rates.  With the current proposal, Alice gets a significantly larger share.  As the rounds progress, Alice's share will decrease more drastically than mine, potentially leading to a more favorable outcome in future rounds.  I'll try to negotiate a more balanced deal."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I think we can do better than the last proposal. This split is more fair considering the inflation rates we'll face, and I believe it sets us on a path to a mutually beneficial agreement.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but the inflation hits me harder. This offer is a compromise to account for that disparity. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is closer to a 50/50 split,  it's still heavily in her favor. The inflation rates are working against Alice more significantly than me, and I believe I can leverage that in future rounds to secure a more favorable outcome. I will continue to try and negotiate a split that is fairer considering the changing value of the money."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Alice, the inflation rates are a significant factor in this negotiation.  This offer is a step towards a fair solution, reflecting the disparity in how our gains are affected by the changing value of money.  I believe it's in both our interests to reach an agreement sooner rather than later.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic.  The clock is ticking and this back and forth is helping neither of us.  A 50/50 split is the simplest and fairest solution at this point. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Alice is right - the clock is ticking. While I would prefer a slightly larger share, given the inflation rates and the potential for both of us to get nothing if we continue to disagree, accepting a 50/50 split is the most practical decision."
