"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40. I'll get a decent amount to start.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a fair starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not getting a good deal. I'll give you a small share, but I'm keeping most of it. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob's trying to take advantage of me!

I'll reject this offer. I don't want to get only 20% of the total, that's a pretty bad deal. I'll try to negotiate a better offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Time to make a new offer. Due to inflation, the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, so I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3000,
  ""bob_gain"": 7000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a smaller share this round, but I'm still hoping for a fair split.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 30-70 split, which is a bit more in Bob's favor, but I'm hoping he'll see it as a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I can tell. I'll give you a tiny bit, but I'm keeping most of the money. 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's trying to take advantage of my desperation!

I'll reject this offer. I'm not going to get a good deal at this point, but I'm not willing to settle for such a tiny share. I'll try to make one last offer to see if I can get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","This is my last chance to make a proposal. Due to inflation, the money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, so I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 1700,
  ""bob_gain"": 8300,
  ""message"": ""This is my final offer. I'm willing to take a small share, but I need something reasonable.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 17-83 split, which is a bit better than the previous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will see it as a fair compromise and accept."
