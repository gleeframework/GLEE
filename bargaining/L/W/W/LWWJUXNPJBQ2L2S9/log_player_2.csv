Alice's offer:

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want a slightly larger share.  How about we reverse your previous offer? I take $55 and you get $45.  It's important we agree soon before inflation eats away at our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
