Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable, Alice. This offer ensures you get a good chunk while accounting for the decreasing value over time. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm rejecting this offer. Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial proposal, and while I understand inflation impacts us both, his offer seems too heavily weighted in his favor, especially considering the larger impact of inflation on him. I want to see if I can get a better deal in the next round."

Round 3

{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. This offer accounts for inflation and gives you a good amount. Let's end this before it gets worse for both of us.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, the clock is ticking and we both lose with every round. This is a fair offer considering the time pressure. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While I appreciate Bob's acknowledgement of the time pressure, his offer is still too low, especially given the higher rate of inflation affecting him. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to see a more equitable split to accept."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Bob, we're both losing out here.  This is a final compromise, let's split it before things get even worse.  We can still walk away with a decent amount.""}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this has gone on long enough. A 50/50 split is the only fair solution at this point. Let's end this before we both lose out. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough decision, but given the inflation rate and the dwindling number of rounds left, accepting a 50/50 split seems like the most reasonable choice. It's better than getting nothing at all."
