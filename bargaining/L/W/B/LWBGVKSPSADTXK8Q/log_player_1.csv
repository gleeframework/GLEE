Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""

```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly more aggressive approach, let's see if we can get a better deal 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure's on!

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'm not ready to accept a 50-50 split just yet. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal for myself."

Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give a bit more, but I think 4:6 is still a good compromise 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to take a bigger share now!

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not comfortable with a 4:6 split, especially considering the value of the money has decreased significantly due to inflation. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal for myself."
