"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'm willing to give you a decent amount.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 70% of the original 100$, and Bob will get 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fairer, considering the money loses value each round.  Let's both get a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the money is worth less each round, I'd like to get a bit more. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like a bit more, considering the value decrease.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the money is worth even less now, I'll aim for a bit more than before. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering the value drop.""
}
```

This time, I'm suggesting a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept."
