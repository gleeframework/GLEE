"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, which is a generous 30% of the total amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. With the inflation, my gain of $450,000 is worth even less than before. On the other hand, Bob's gain of $550,000 is also worth less, but still a significant amount.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Time for my next move!

Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a higher percentage of the remaining amount. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a 40% share, but I'm hoping he'll accept this offer before the next round of inflation hits."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

Considering the significant reduction in value, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. My gain of $520,000 is worth only about 52% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain of $480,000 is worth about 48% of the original amount.

I'll accept this offer, as it's the best I can get at this point.
