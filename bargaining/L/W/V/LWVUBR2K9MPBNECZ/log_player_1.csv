"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leaving $4,000 for Bob. I'm framing it as a fair split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle and compromise 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $5,000 is now worth 95% of its original value, and Bob's gain of $5,000 is now worth 90% of its original value.

I'm not sure if I want to meet in the middle, as it seems like I'll be giving up some value. However, it's a relatively fair split, and I don't want to risk going to another round if I can avoid it.

I'll accept this offer.
