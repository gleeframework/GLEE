Round 4

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a tiny bit more, but I still think I should get the bigger share. 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is barely budging while inflation is severely eroding Bob's potential gains.  It's time to show Alice that Bob is serious about getting a better deal, even if it means risking a worse outcome in later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""The inflation is getting ridiculous!  This is my final offer - take it or leave it.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time for a power play. By significantly increasing his demand and stating it's his final offer, Bob is putting pressure on Alice. Here's why:

* **Urgency:**  With each round, the deal is worth significantly less to Bob. This strong stance emphasizes the time constraint.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Alice is risking getting a worse deal in later rounds if Bob starts making even riskier propositions due to the shrinking pot.  
* **Anchoring:**  By throwing out a higher number, even if extreme, it can influence Alice's perception of what's negotiable.

This is a high-risk, high-reward strategy. If Alice rejects it, Bob needs to prepare for potentially drastic offers in the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm not buying it. My turn again. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a tough spot. Let's analyze:

* **The Offer:** Alice is inching closer to a more even split, but it's still heavily in her favor considering the inflation working against Bob.
* **The Risk:**  Rejecting this offer means venturing into extremely risky territory. With each round, Bob's potential gain diminishes significantly.
* **Alice's Stance:**  She's clearly calling Bob's bluff and seems confident in her position.

While accepting isn't ideal, it might be the most logical choice at this point. 

**Therefore:** {""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  It's painful, but better to take a smaller share than risk getting nothing at all in the later rounds. This situation highlights the power of negotiation timing and understanding the impact of external factors like inflation."
