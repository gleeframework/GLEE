"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount, and I'm willing to give Bob a slightly larger share to get the game started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a slightly more balanced split is fairer. Let's see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 5% less, so I'd rather negotiate a bit more. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to give up that much. I'd like to propose a slightly more balanced split myself.""
}
```

Your turn!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is starting to take its toll! With the reduced value of my potential gain, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 525000,
  ""bob_gain"": 475000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to keep a slight edge. Can you accept this offer?""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to increase my share a bit, but this is my final offer. I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are starting to bite! With my gain being worth nearly 15% less than in the first round, I'm getting a bit desperate. However, I'm not willing to give up that much more. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to give up that much more. I'd rather take my chances in the next round.""
}
```

I'll try to hold out for a better deal, but the clock is ticking!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The effects of inflation are really starting to add up! With my gain being worth over 19% less than in the first round, I'm getting really desperate. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 475000,
  ""bob_gain"": 525000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give up some of my share, but I really need a fair deal. Please consider this offer.""
}
```

I'm trying to be realistic and accept that the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise."
