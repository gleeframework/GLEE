"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the original 100$, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

After considering Bob's offer, I decide to...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Time to make a new offer!

Considering the inflation, my offer is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

I'll split the remaining $100 equally between us, but I'm hoping Bob will see the value in accepting this fair offer!"
