"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start, and we can reassess as needed.""}

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 evenly, with each of us getting $5,000. This is a fair starting point, and we can adjust as needed in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share this round, but I think it's a fair start. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 4000-6000 split, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth 5% less for me this round, I'm not as concerned about the absolute numbers as I was in the first round.

I'll decide to {""decision"": ""reject""} this offer and proceed to the next round. I'll try to negotiate a better deal for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share this round, but I think 5500 is still a bit too much. Let's meet in the middle.""}

I'm proposing a 4500-5500 split, which is a slight adjustment from my initial offer. I'm trying to find a compromise that works for both of us, while also taking into account the decreasing value of the money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 4800 is still too low. I'll meet you halfway between my previous offer and your current one. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 4800-5200 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Since the money is worth even less for me this round, I'm trying to be more flexible.

I'll decide to {""decision"": ""reject""} this offer, but I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly more aggressive. I'll try to get a better deal for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Let's try to find a fair compromise.""}

I'm proposing a 5000-5000 split, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's previous offer. I'm hoping that this split will be more acceptable to Bob, and we can finally find a way to divide the money."
