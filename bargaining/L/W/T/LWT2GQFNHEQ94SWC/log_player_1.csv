# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the proposal, but I'll think it through.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the proposal in terms of the current value. Bob is offering me $400,000, which is worth 5% less than the initial $500,000 I was offered in the first round.

I'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round. I'd like to make a new proposal that takes into account the inflation and the fact that Bob is trying to take advantage of it.
