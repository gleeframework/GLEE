I propose taking almost everything, leaving Bob with just $1.  While I understand this might seem unfair, I'm playing to maximize my potential gain. Since the money depreciates significantly each round, it's in my best interest to secure as much as possible now.  Let's see what Bob does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer gives me a substantial amount, it's still significantly less than what I could have gotten in the first round. Given the continuing inflation, accepting now would mean losing out on a much larger potential gain later.  I'll gamble and see what Bob offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is less than what he offered me in the previous round, but it's still a considerable amount.  I'm trying to find a middle ground where we can both get a reasonable amount of money before inflation erodes our potential gains even further."
