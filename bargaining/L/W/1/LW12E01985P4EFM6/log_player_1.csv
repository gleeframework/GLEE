Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script. I think a 60/40 split is more fair considering the inflation we're facing. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
