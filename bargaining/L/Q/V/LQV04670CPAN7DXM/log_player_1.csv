"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start""}

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 equally, with each of us getting $5,000. This is a straightforward and fair starting point, and it gives us a chance to see how the game unfolds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good starting point 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the unequal split, but I'm willing to consider it. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not too concerned about the inflation effect.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now, hoping that I can negotiate a better deal in future rounds.
