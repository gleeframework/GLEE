I'm going to start with a very aggressive offer, hoping Bob will accept it early on.  This way I can get a large chunk of the money before the inflation kicks in too hard!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While Bob's offer is much less than my original proposal, it's still a significant amount of money.  I'm worried that if I reject, the inflation will continue to eat away at the value of the money, and I might end up with less in the end.  It's a risk, but I'm going to accept."
