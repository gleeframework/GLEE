"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $10,000, leaving Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I need to consider the effective value of my gain. 

In this round, my gain of $5000 is worth 80% of its original value, so it's actually equivalent to $4000 in the first round's money. 

I'll accept the offer.
