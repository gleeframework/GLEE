"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping that he'll accept and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, Bob's offer is now worth less than my initial offer, but still a significant amount. I'll consider it carefully.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time, hoping to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 950000,
  ""bob_gain"": 50000
}
```

I'm offering Bob a much smaller share, but I'm still willing to give him a decent amount to try to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another offer from Bob, and it looks like he's sticking to his guns. However, with the increased inflation, the value of his offer is even lower than before.

I'll think carefully about it...
