"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your turn to be generous. This is my counter offer. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle?""}\n\n###\n\nI've reduced my initial offer to try to find a compromise with Bob, considering the inflation that's affecting the value of the money. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's settle this. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on the value of the money, Bob's offer seems reasonable at this point. The difference between our gains isn't drastic, and accepting this offer ensures that I receive a substantial amount rather than risking further devaluation or ending up with nothing if we fail to reach an agreement within the 12 rounds. Accepting now seems like the most pragmatic decision."
