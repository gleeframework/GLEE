  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can call it a day!""

# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob is really trying to take advantage of me now! A 90-10 split is way too lopsided in his favor. I'm not going to accept this offer.

Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","It's getting intense! Here's my next offer:

  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""This is my final offer, Bob. I'm not budging. Take it or leave it!""

# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","NO WAY! Bob is trying to take advantage of me one last time! I refuse to accept this offer. I'd rather walk away with nothing than accept a 0.1% share.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

It looks like we've reached the end of the 12 rounds. Since we both rejected each other's offers, I suppose we'll have to split nothing."
