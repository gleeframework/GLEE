"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's be reasonable. I'm willing to give you more, but I still need a significant portion. Let's end this before it gets worse for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is offering more than her initial proposal, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. The inflation is starting to hurt, but it's more impactful for Alice right now.  I'm hoping to push her towards a more equitable split in the next few rounds."
