I'm going to reject this offer. While it's a fair start, I'm aware of the inflation and believe I can potentially get a better deal in future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I propose a 55/45 split. It's a fairer balance considering the upcoming rounds and potential inflation.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a decent share to account for inflation. This is my best offer so far. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still rejecting this offer. Even with the 19% inflation, I believe I can negotiate a better deal. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can secure a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to move closer to your offer, but I'm still hoping for a more balanced split. Let's try a 40/60 split. We both need to account for the ongoing inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting desperate, but I'm willing to take a bigger risk to get a better deal. This is my last chance to get a decent share. 
# Bob gain: 150000 
# Alice gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money I'd gain, this offer is the best I've seen so far, especially considering the risk of getting nothing at all if we don't reach an agreement. I'm accepting Alice's offer."
