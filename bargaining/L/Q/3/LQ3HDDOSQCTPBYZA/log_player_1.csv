"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 90-10, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 90% of the money, leaving Bob with 10%. This is a generous offer, considering the high stakes and the risk of inflation. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55/45 split. It's a fairer balance considering the upcoming rounds and potential inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a bite out of my potential gain!

Considering Bob's proposal, I'm not convinced that a 55/45 split is fair, especially since the money is already worth less due to inflation. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not convinced by the 55/45 split. I'll try to do better next round.""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer, hoping to get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really starting to kick in now!

Here's my revised offer, taking into account the reduced value of the money:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a decent share to account for inflation. This is my best offer so far.""
}
```

I'm offering a 70/30 split, hoping Bob will see the value in accepting this deal before the money becomes even more worthless!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to move closer to your offer, but I'm still hoping for a more balanced split. Let's try a 40/60 split. We both need to account for the ongoing inflation. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really eating away at my potential gain now!

Considering Bob's revised offer, I'm still not convinced that a 40/60 split is in my best interest, especially since the money is worth even less now. I'd like to try to negotiate for an even better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to accept a 40/60 split. I think I can do better than that.""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer, hoping to get a better deal before the money becomes even more worthless!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really taking its toll now!

Here's my revised offer, taking into account the reduced value of the money:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 850000,
  ""bob_gain"": 150000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, but I'm willing to take a bigger risk to get a better deal. This is my last chance to get a decent share.""
}
```

I'm offering a 85/15 split, hoping Bob will accept this deal before the money becomes almost worthless. I'm taking a big risk, but I think it's worth it to try to get a better deal."
