"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split relatively evenly, with a slight advantage for me considering the inflation factor. 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While the offer seems fair, it's advantageous to try and negotiate a better deal for myself, especially considering the inflation factor.  I'll try to get a more even split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Let's split the money evenly.  It's the fairest way to divide it, and I think we can both agree that working together is better than risking losing everything due to inflation."" 
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate the sentiment of an even split, but the inflation is working against you. This offer is still fair and gives you a reasonable amount. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While I acknowledge the inflation factor, I'm still hoping for a more even split.  I'll try to negotiate a better deal for myself in the next round."
