"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll give you a decent chunk, but I'm not giving away the whole thing.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. I'll take half, and you can have the other half.  This way, we both get a good deal. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, but I still need to make a decision.

I accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think it's a fair deal, and we both get a decent amount of money."
