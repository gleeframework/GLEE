"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. What do you say, Bob?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which seems reasonable given the initial amount of $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering Bob's new offer, I think it's still a bit too skewed towards his favor. I'd like to try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The game continues! With the money being worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think this is the most I can afford. Take it or leave it!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise again, but I think this is the best I can do. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll now!

Considering Bob's new offer, I think meeting in the middle is a good idea, but I'd like to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. However, since I've already rejected a 60-40 split and a 58-42 split, a 50-50 split seems like a reasonable compromise.
