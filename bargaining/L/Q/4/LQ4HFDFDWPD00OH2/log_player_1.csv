"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This means I'm offering to take $8,000 and leave $2,000 for Bob. It's a good starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for Bob, he's effectively offering me $3,200 (4000 / 0.8) and himself $3,200 (6000 / 0.8).

I'll accept this offer.
