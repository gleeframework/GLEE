Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
 
I'm going to propose a 9000/1000 split. I figure it's a good starting point, and I'm confident I can get a better deal in future rounds if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I don't accept this offer. While it is an even split, I am confident I can get more than $5000. I want to see what Bob's other offers will be."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm going to offer a 7000/3000 split. I believe this is a fair offer, as it's closer to my initial proposal, and gives Bob a chance to get something instead of nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. It's not a good deal for me, and I'm confident I can get a better outcome in future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm going to offer a 8000/2000 split.  Bob keeps rejecting my offers, and I'm starting to think he's being stubborn. I need to show him that I'm serious about getting a good deal, but I'm willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. Bob's offer is getting progressively worse, and I'm still confident that I can get a better deal in the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to offer a 6000/4000 split.  Bob's getting more greedy with his offers, so I'm going to have to meet him halfway.  I'm still confident I can get a better deal in the remaining rounds, but I need to start showing flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer.  Bob's offer is becoming increasingly unreasonable, and I'm still confident I can secure a better outcome. I believe I can get a better deal in the remaining rounds, even if it means getting nothing if we fail to agree."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm going to propose a 5000/5000 split. It seems like neither of us is willing to budge, and we're running out of time.  I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm willing to be reasonable and that a 50/50 split is the best we can do given the circumstances."
