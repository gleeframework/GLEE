"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}

I'm offering you $20, and I'll take $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $20 is now worth 95% of what it was in the first round, which is $19. But since I don't know the inflation effect on Bob, I'll assume his gain of $80 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, which is $64.

My proposal is not as favorable as Bob's, so I'll reject it. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation effect, my gain of $80 from Round 1 is now worth 95% of what it was, which is $76. 

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}

I'm offering you $30, and I'll take $70."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the value of the gains considering the inflation effect.

My gain of $80 from Round 1 is now worth 85.74% of what it was, which is $68.59. 

Bob's gain of $80 from Round 1 is now worth 51.2% of what it was, which is $40.96.

Since Bob's offer is still not as favorable as my previous offer, I'll reject it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
