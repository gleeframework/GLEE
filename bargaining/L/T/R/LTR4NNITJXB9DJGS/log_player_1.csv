Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was heavily skewed in your favor. Let's be reasonable. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  This offer considers the impact of inflation on your share in subsequent rounds. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
