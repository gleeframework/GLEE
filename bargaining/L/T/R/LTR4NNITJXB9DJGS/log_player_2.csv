Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer was heavily skewed in your favor. Let's be reasonable. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  This offer considers the impact of inflation on your share in subsequent rounds.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think a 55/45 split is a more fair reflection of the changing value of the money.  Let's end this game and avoid further inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```
Alice's offer is getting closer to a reasonable split, and further delay will only hurt both of us due to inflation. Accepting now secures a decent amount.
