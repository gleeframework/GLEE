"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a relatively even split considering we're starting with a large amount of money. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can wrap up the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll meet you in the middle 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to drive a harder bargain.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering the inflation, my gain of $3000 is actually worth $2400 (80% of $3000), which is a significant reduction.

However, I'm not sure if I want to give Bob such a large share of the money. I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer or reject it and try to negotiate further.

For now, I'll reject the offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was to meet me in the middle, I'll try to meet him halfway from my original offer. In Round 1, I offered Bob $4000, so I'll offer him $5000 now.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 2500,
  ""bob_gain"": 7500,
  ""message"": ""Meeting you halfway, let's see if you'll accept this compromise.""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finally conclude the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I want more 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is still not satisfied with the offer.

Let me calculate the actual values considering the inflation:

My gain of $2500 in Round 3 is worth $1250 (48.8% of $2500) in Round 4.
Bob's gain of $7500 in Round 3 is worth $5462.5 (72.9% of $7500) in Round 4.

Considering the inflation, Bob's offer is actually a gain of $5462.5 for him and $4500 for me, which is a relatively close split.

I'll accept this offer.
