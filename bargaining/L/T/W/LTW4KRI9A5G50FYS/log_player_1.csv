"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I propose to take $900,000 and leave $100,000 for Bob.  This seems like a fair starting point, given the potential for inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to try a counter-offer to Bob's proposal.  Since the money is worth less now due to inflation, I'll offer him $300,000 and keep $700,000 for myself. This keeps the same ratio from his offer, but with a larger share for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to stick with trying to get a larger share, even with the inflation. I'll reject Bob's offer and hope for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway this time.  Since inflation is eating away at the value of the money, I'll offer him $400,000 and keep $600,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the offer isn't ideal due to inflation, I've lost a significant amount of potential earnings with each rejection.  It's better to accept this offer and secure some money than risk getting nothing at all in the remaining rounds."
