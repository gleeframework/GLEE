"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take 60 and you can have 40.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a relatively fair and simple start to the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair.  It's my turn to propose now. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too happy about Bob's proposal, but I'll consider it. Here's my decision:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not going to accept a 40-60 split. I was hoping for a more balanced split, and 40 is a bit too low for me. I'll wait for Bob's next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, let's meet in the middle with a 55-45 split.""}

I'm trying to find a more balanced split, so I'm proposing a 55-45 split. This is a bit more in my favor, but still a reasonable compromise."
