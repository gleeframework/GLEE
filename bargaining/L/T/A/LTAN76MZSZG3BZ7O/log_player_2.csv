Alice's offer:

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still the one who needs to make more to make this worthwhile. Let's get this done! 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is offering a bit more, the devaluation is significant. Accepting $200,000 now is a bad deal compared to what we could potentially get, even with the decreasing value. It's still early in the game, so we need to push for a better split."

{
""bob_gain"": 600000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm coming down a bit, but it's still your turn to compromise.  Let's reach a fair agreement before this money is completely worthless! 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is slowly coming down, but not nearly enough to offset the rapid devaluation. We need to hold firm and emphasize the urgency of the situation.  While $300,000 might seem tempting, it's a significantly less valuable $300,000 than it was a few rounds ago. We still have room to negotiate, even with the dwindling rounds."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm compromising again at 55/45. This is more than fair considering the time pressure and the rapid devaluation.  Let's be sensible and end this!""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm coming down again, but this is my final offer. We're both losing money with each round. Let's end this before it's too late! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough one. Alice is playing hardball, and the clock is really working against us now.  

* **The Devaluation:** The money is losing value quickly. While $400,000 is much less than we aimed for, it's significantly better than what we might get in later rounds, or even nothing if we run out of time. 
* **Alice's Stance:**  She called this her ""final offer."" There's a good chance she won't budge further, and we'll be forced to accept even less in a later round.

This is a gamble, but at this point, it's the safest option to avoid walking away with absolutely nothing."
