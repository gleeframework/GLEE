"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and call it a day!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we each take $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'm not getting taken advantage of! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, and I'm not willing to accept an offer that leaves me with only $300,000. I'll reject this offer and try to do better in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of either!""}

I'm proposing a 45/55 split, which is a bit more generous than Bob's offer, but still gives me a decent chunk of the money."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with the 40/60 split, and the fact that I'm still getting a smaller share than Bob. The inflation is taking a big toll on my potential earnings, and I'm not willing to accept an offer that leaves me with only $400,000. I'll reject this offer and try to do better in the next round."

I'm proposing a 42/58 split, which is a bit more generous than Bob's previous offer, and I'm hoping that Bob will finally see the light and accept a more balanced deal."

# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm really struggling with the effects of inflation, and the fact that I'm getting a smaller and smaller share of the pie. The 35/65 split is still not acceptable to me, and I'm not willing to accept an offer that leaves me with only $350,000. I'll reject this offer and try to do better in the next round."

I'm proposing a 38/62 split, which is a bit more generous than Bob's previous offer, and I'm hoping that Bob will finally see the value in a more balanced deal."
