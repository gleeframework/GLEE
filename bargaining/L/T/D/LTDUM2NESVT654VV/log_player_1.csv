{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept it and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't think I'll accept this offer. Bob is trying to take a huge chunk of the money, and I'm not comfortable with that. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was quite aggressive, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's more favorable to me. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair share. Let's try this split. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on Bob's offer! With the money being worth 48.8% less, Bob's offer is equivalent to $52,000 in the first round, which is a significant reduction.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further. I'm not willing to accept such a small share.

  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Time's running out, Bob. I'm willing to take a bit more, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of.""

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll on Bob's offer now. With the money being worth 67.23% less, Bob's offer is equivalent to $22,000 in the first round, which is a tiny fraction of the original amount.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further. I'm not willing to accept such a small share, especially when I know that the money is worth less and less with each passing round.
