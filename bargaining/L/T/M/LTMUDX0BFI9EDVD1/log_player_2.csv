"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and end this quickly! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While Alice's offer seems fair on the surface, it's important to remember the inflation factor.  Since Bob's money loses 5% value each round, it's in his best interest to try and negotiate a better deal or at least hold out for a few rounds to see if Alice will offer more."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is a fair starting point, considering the inflation we're both facing.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation is affecting you more, I'm willing to take a bit more, but still leaving you with a good amount. Let's settle this! 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

While Alice's offer is slightly better than her initial offer, it's still not favorable enough to accept.  With the inflation factor impacting Bob so heavily, it's better to try and push for a larger share or hold out for more rounds to see if Alice becomes more amenable to a deal closer to Bob's desired split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""We're both losing money with each passing round. Let's be practical - a 60/40 split is fair considering the inflation, and it gives us both a decent amount.  It's time to end this before we both lose even more.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're trying to compensate for the inflation, but I still think I can get a better deal. This is my new offer. 
# Bob gain: 410000 
# Alice gain: 590000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice's offer is actually worse than her previous offer, even though she claims it's better. With the inflation impacting Bob so significantly, it's crucial to hold out for a better deal.  While the money is diminishing, it's still worth pushing for a more equitable split."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""With each round, the value of our money decreases. It's time to be realistic. This 65/35 split is my final offer, and it's the best way to maximize our gains before we lose more. Let's end this game and avoid further losses.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're trying to rush me, but I'm not budging. The inflation is hurting you more, so I'll take a bigger share. 
# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

While Alice is trying to take advantage of the inflation, it's crucial for Bob to hold his ground. Accepting this offer would mean taking a significant loss due to the inflation factor. It's better to push for a more fair split or even risk losing a bit more to secure a better outcome in the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""We're running out of time, and the inflation is making this game a losing proposition for both of us.  I'm offering a 70/30 split, which is the best we can do to salvage some value.  It's time to be reasonable and settle this before it's too late.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not worried about the time, I'm worried about getting the best deal. And with the inflation hitting you harder, I think I can get an even better share. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice's offer is getting worse, even though she claims she's getting a better deal. The inflation is hurting Bob significantly, and accepting this would result in a substantial loss.  Bob needs to stay strong and push for a more equitable split, even if it means risking losing even more in the remaining rounds.  The potential for a more favorable outcome in the future outweighs the risk of accepting a bad deal now."

Round 10

{""bob_gain"": 750000, ""alice_gain"": 250000, ""message"": ""We are down to the wire.  It's time to be realistic. This 75/25 split is my final offer. Any more rounds and we both risk getting nothing. Let's end this game now and secure some value before it's too late.""}

Round 11
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.13% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not buying the 'we're running out of time' argument. I think I can squeeze a bit more out of this deal. 
# Bob gain: 320000 
# Alice gain: 680000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice's offer is simply unacceptable.  While the pressure is mounting with the dwindling rounds,  it's essential for Bob to hold his ground.  Accepting this offer would mean a huge loss due to the inflation and would set a terrible precedent for future negotiations.  While the risk of getting nothing is real, it's better to hold out for a more favorable split, even if it means potentially walking away with nothing.  Bob needs to be strategic and strong in these final rounds."
