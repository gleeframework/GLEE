This is a tough one, but I'm going to accept. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:**  We're running out of rounds, and if we don't reach an agreement, we both get nothing. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** While I'd like to get more, Alice's offers are only going to get worse for her (due to the inflation) and closer to my desired outcome.  Waiting might net me an extra 1-2% at best, but risks losing everything.  

It's a gamble either way at this point, but I think this is the safer bet.
