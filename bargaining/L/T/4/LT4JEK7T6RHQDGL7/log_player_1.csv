"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a more balanced split, considering the value of the money will decrease with each round. Let's be smart about it! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting that Bob thinks this is a more balanced split!

Considering the money is worth 5% less now, I'd rather try to get a better deal. I'll reject this offer and hope to negotiate a better split in the next round.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, Bob. No need to be greedy!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems like a fair compromise. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
