Let's see if we can get a better deal!"

Let's flip the script on her!  I'll offer her a smaller share, hoping she'll take it.  After all, she's already rejected a 70% share!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still hoping for a better deal.  Alice has already rejected a 70/30 split in my favor, and now she's offering me less.  Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to stick with a 60/40 split in my favor. Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, but she's also shown a preference for getting a larger share. I'm hoping this offer is appealing enough to her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It's getting risky, and we're already losing a lot of money due to inflation. I'm willing to settle for a 50/50 split at this point. It's better than nothing, and I'm not sure how much lower Alice's offer will go."
