"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm offering you a significant portion, but time is money, and it's literally devaluing as we speak. This offer is fair and benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
