Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a high offer for myself, hoping to secure a deal quickly.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While it hurts to take a much smaller share, I have to accept. If I reject, I'll have to make an offer in the next round, and the money will be worth even less then.  It's better to take what I can get now."
