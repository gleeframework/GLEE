"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'm taking a larger share, but I'm sure you'll understand with the inflation coming into play! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see what I can get for myself!  I'm not sure about the fairness of that proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I propose a fairer split, considering the inflation will affect us both. We'll each get a good portion.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but let's be realistic about the inflation.  This split is fair given the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 5200 
# Alice gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Alice's offer is reasonable given the circumstances. It's a decent share for me, and the inflation would make me lose even more if we go to another round."
