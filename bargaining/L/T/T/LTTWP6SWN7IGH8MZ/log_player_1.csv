Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was quite fair, but I believe we can both benefit if we switch the amounts. This ensures a more equitable split while still capitalizing on the early rounds to minimize inflation's impact. 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250
