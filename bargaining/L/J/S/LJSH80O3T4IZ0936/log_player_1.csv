Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.

**Reasoning:**

Even though Bob claims to be considering the impact of inflation, his offer is getting worse for me. It's clear he's trying to take advantage of the situation.  I need to hold out for a better deal, even if it means risking further inflation."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""This is getting ridiculous.  Let's split it evenly and end this before we both lose too much to inflation.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to try a different tactic.  Offering a 50/50 split might seem like I'm giving up, but it's actually a strong move. Here's why:

* **Simplicity and Fairness:** A 50/50 split is inherently understandable and seems fair on the surface. 
* **Highlighting Inflation's Impact:**  By suggesting this, I'm implicitly reminding Bob that continued negotiation is hurting BOTH of us. He's not immune to the effects of time.
* **Potential for Bob to Appear Greedy:** If he rejects an even split, it makes him look unreasonable and unwilling to compromise.  This could make him more likely to concede in a future round."
