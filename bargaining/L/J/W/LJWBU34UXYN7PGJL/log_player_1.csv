I'm going to offer Bob a small share, hoping he'll accept it in the first round.  I'll try to maximize my share early on, as the value of money is going to decrease with each round."

{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's tempting to take something, even a small amount, the inflation makes this a losing proposition for me. I'm willing to wait for another round, hoping to secure a better deal as the value of the money continues to decline for Bob."

I'm going to reject this offer. Even though the inflation is hurting me, I'm confident that I can secure a better deal in the next round.

I'm going to lower my offer slightly this round.  While I want to maximize my gain, I also need to keep in mind the decreasing value of the money due to inflation.  This offer is a good balance between securing a deal and holding out for a better one in future rounds."

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm going to accept this offer.  The inflation has significantly eroded the value of the money, and while I'd prefer a higher share, accepting this offer ensures I get something.  It's better to secure a small amount than to risk losing everything by continuing to reject offers."
