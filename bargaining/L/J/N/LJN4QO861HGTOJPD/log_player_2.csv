"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 90/10. I think it's a fair deal considering I'm taking all the risk with the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer was heavily skewed in your favor. Let's be reasonable - I'm proposing a 60/40 split. Take it or leave it, the clock is ticking and the value is decreasing for both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's split it 55/45.  I'm losing more value with each round, so this is the best I can do. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```
Alice's offer is getting closer to a more even split, and the inflation is starting to significantly impact her potential gains. Accepting now guarantees a reasonable amount, whereas holding out might force her to offer even less in future rounds, potentially leading to a worse outcome for me.
