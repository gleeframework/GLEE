"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can reassess as we go.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting 6,000 and Bob getting 4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering we have 11 rounds left. Let's see what you think. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not convinced by Bob's offer. I think it's a bit too skewed in his favor, and I'd like to negotiate further. With 11 rounds left, I'm willing to compromise, but I think I can do better than 45%."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's try a 52-48 split. It's still a compromise, but I think it's fair considering our starting point.""}

I'm proposing a 52-48 split, with me getting 5,200 and Bob getting 4,800."
