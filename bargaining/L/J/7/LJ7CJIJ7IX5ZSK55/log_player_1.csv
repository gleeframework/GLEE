Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going for a big chunk of the money early on. Bob will be getting less, but he can either accept or face a higher chance of getting even less in the next round due to inflation.  Let's see what he chooses!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's tempting, I'm confident that I can do better. Bob is feeling the pressure of inflation, and I believe he'll make a more favorable offer in the next round. Let's see if he realizes he needs to make some concessions!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly, hoping to incentivize Bob to accept.  He's already experienced the effects of inflation and realizes the situation is getting worse for him with each passing round."
