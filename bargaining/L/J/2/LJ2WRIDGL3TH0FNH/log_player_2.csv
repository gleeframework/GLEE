"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This offer is based on the initial value of the money. As it decreases in value with each round, it's important to consider the diminishing worth. I propose we divide the money in a 3:1 ratio, favoring Bob slightly to account for the decrease in value over time. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000
