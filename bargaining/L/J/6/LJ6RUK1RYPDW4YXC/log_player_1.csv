"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

This means I'm offering to give myself $70 and Bob $30. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, I'm getting less value from the $30 I'm offered, but I still have to consider the offer. I'll think about it...
