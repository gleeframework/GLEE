"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, 60-40. I'm hoping we can agree quickly.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $60 and Bob getting $40. My message is a friendly opening offer, hoping we can agree quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script. I'm hoping we can agree quickly. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my potential gain is now worth 5% less, so I'll have to be more cautious.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to give up 60% of the remaining money just yet. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, the money is worth 10% less now. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. 55-45 is a fairer split, considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to reflect the decreasing value of the money and trying to find a compromise with Bob."
