I'm starting with a 60/40 split in my favor, as I'm the first to propose and have to account for the inflation affecting me more.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is less favorable to me than my initial proposal, and the inflation hurts me more. I'll reject and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

I'm adjusting my offer slightly to account for the inflation, but still aiming for a favorable split.  Since Bob rejected my initial proposal, I'm hoping he'll see that this is a fairer compromise."
