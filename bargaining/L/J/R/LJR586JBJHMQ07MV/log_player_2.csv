"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal. I take $70, and you get $30. It's a good offer, considering the inflation working against you. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see if I can get a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think it's fair to split the money more evenly, given the inflation. Let's call it a 55/45 split, with me getting 55.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The inflation is hurting you more each round. I'll offer you $35.  Take it or leave it, it's your last chance for a decent share. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It's getting risky to keep rejecting offers.  While I'd prefer a more even split,  $35 is still a decent share considering the inflation."
