**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation working against me. While the offer is getting closer to a reasonable split, I need to hold out for a better deal.  The longer Alice waits, the more desperate she'll become as the risk of getting nothing increases for both of us."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""Okay, let's be realistic. 48-52, take it or leave it.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're approaching the later rounds and need to make a move to avoid getting nothing. This offer is a slight concession, reflecting the increasing pressure from inflation, but still favors me slightly.  It sends a message that I'm willing to negotiate but won't be walked over."

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

It's time to cut my losses. Alice has met my last offer, and while it's not ideal, the impact of inflation is becoming too significant. Accepting now guarantees me a reasonable sum, whereas continuing to gamble could leave me with nothing."
