"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I take $6000, you get $4000. This avoids us both losing money due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see if we can get a better deal!  It's early in the game, and I'm not sure I want to settle for such a low share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 7000,
  ""alice_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm going for a bigger share this time. I think a 70/30 split is fair, considering the inflation we're facing.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your offer was too risky for me.  Let's settle this before inflation eats away at the value. I'm proposing a $6500/$3500 split. It's better for me than your last offer, and it still guarantees you a decent sum. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It's better to take what I can get at this point. The inflation is hurting, and I don't want to risk getting nothing."
