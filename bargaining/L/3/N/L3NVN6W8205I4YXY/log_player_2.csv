**Reasoning:**

Alice is drastically undervaluing the impact of inflation on her returns. While she's framing her offer as ""generous,"" it's far from it given that her $52 will be worth significantly less after inflation.  I need to push for a larger share to make up for the fact that my money isn't losing value."
