"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $1000, and I'll take the rest.""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount to start with, and I'm leaving room for negotiations in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle, a 50/50 split 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $5000 is now worth $4500. Bob's gain of $5000 remains the same.

I'm not thrilled about the 50/50 split, but it's a reasonable offer. I'll accept it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
