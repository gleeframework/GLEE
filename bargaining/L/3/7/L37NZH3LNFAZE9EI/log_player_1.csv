"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I'm offering Bob a small share, hoping to secure a quick win. I'm betting he'll accept since it's a better deal than waiting for potential inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. While it's tempting to secure something, the potential for a better deal in future rounds outweighs the current offer. I'm confident I can negotiate a better split with Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm raising my share, but still leaving a significant portion for Bob. This offer is intended to be a compromise, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while still securing a majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than nothing, the inflation is starting to take a serious bite out of the money. I'm going to continue playing the long game and see if I can secure a better deal in the next few rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm lowering my share slightly, but still keeping a comfortable majority. I'm hoping that Bob realizes we are both losing more money with each passing round, and that he'll accept this offer before the inflation becomes too severe."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

The inflation is getting out of hand, but I'm still not willing to settle for a deal where Bob gets more than me. I'm going to keep pushing for a better split, even if it means we both end up with less money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split. The inflation is rapidly reducing the value of the money, so it's in both of our best interests to reach an agreement. We're at a point where a fair split is the most logical choice."
