"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable, Alice. This offer leaves us both with a good amount. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better deal than last time. Let's work towards a fairer split.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is a fair split. Let's end this before inflation eats away at your share. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
While I'd prefer a more even split, the inflation is becoming a serious problem. Accepting this offer at least secures some money for me, which is better than nothing."
