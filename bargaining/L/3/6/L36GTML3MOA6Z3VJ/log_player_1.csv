"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leave $4,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll think carefully about this offer. Since the offer is equal split, I'll have to consider the fact that my gain is worth 20% less than in the previous round.

I decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 40% less than in the first round, I'll aim for a slightly larger share to compensate for the reduced value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
