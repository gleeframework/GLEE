"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}

I'm offering 60% to myself and 40% to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, Bob's offer is a bit more favorable to me, but I'll consider it.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'll reject this offer and proceed to Round 3."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a new proposal for Round 3. Considering the inflation has affected Bob's share, I'll aim for a slightly more favorable split for myself this time.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}"
