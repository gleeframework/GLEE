"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can move on to the next round.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can start negotiating from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more balanced split is fairer. Let's try this. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effects of inflation, my offer would be equivalent to 7200 in the first round, so Bob's offer of 4500 is actually a significant reduction for me.

However, I'm willing to accept this offer since it's still a relatively balanced split. I'll take the 4500 and hope that I can negotiate a better deal in future rounds.
