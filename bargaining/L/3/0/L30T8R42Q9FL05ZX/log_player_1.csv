Bob's offer:

# Bob gain: 550000

**Reasoning:**

While the time pressure is increasing, Bob's offer is still heavily skewed in his favor, especially considering the inflation working against him. I'm aiming to secure at least 60% of the initial sum, and I believe that's attainable given the remaining rounds and the decreasing value for Bob."
