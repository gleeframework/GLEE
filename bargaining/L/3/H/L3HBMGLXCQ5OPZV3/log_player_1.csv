"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can adjust in future rounds.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. I'm framing it as a fair split to see how he reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, given the inflation rate that affects us differently. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the changing value of money, I'll re-evaluate the offer.

In this round, my gain of $4,000 is worth 80% of the original $6,000 I proposed in Round 1, and Bob's gain of $6,000 is worth 95% of the original $6,400 he proposed in his offer.

I think a 60/40 split is a reasonable adjustment for the changing circumstances. I accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
