Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still hoping for a better deal, but I'm willing to compromise. Let's try to find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, it's still heavily in her favor. The inflation is hurting her much more than me. Holding out for a better offer in the next few rounds is the stronger strategic play."
