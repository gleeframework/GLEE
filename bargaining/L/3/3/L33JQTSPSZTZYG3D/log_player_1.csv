"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, which is a relatively small amount, but it's a fair start. If he accepts, we can wrap up the game and I'll get $700,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take this offer 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting the value of the money!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'm not as keen on Bob's offer as I was on my initial one. I'll have to think carefully...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting Bob's offer. I'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less now, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. I'll aim to get a bit more than before to compensate for the reduced value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You're being a bit greedy, but I'll meet you in the middle.""
}
```

This time, I'm offering Bob $450,000, which is a slightly smaller amount than before, but I'm hoping it's enough to make him consider accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you in the middle, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value now! The numbers are getting smaller and smaller...

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'm not sure if I want to accept Bob's offer. He's still getting a bit more than I am, and I'm not sure if I want to give up that much more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting Bob's offer. I'd like to make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now, so I'll have to adjust my offer accordingly. I'll aim to get a bit more than before to compensate for the reduced value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, it's the fairest way.""
}
```

This time, I'm offering Bob a 50/50 split, which is a fair and equal distribution of the remaining money."
