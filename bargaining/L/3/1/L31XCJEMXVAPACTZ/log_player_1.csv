"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount, but it's still a decent chunk of change considering the inflation rate. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair start, let's see if we can do better! 
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","Thanks for the update on the inflation rates.

I'm not too thrilled about the offer, but it's still a decent proposal. I'll consider it carefully.

After some thought, I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping to get a better deal, especially considering that Bob's gain is still quite substantial. I'll wait for his next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive this time, taking a slightly larger share of the remaining amount. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can wrap up the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Getting closer, but I think I can do better still! 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking its toll!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll have to be more careful with my decision. I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but it's still a decent proposal.

After some thought, I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping that Bob will make a more generous offer in the next round, considering the reduced value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
 ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm trying to be more conciliatory this time, aiming for a 50-50 split. With the inflation eating away at the value of the money, I think this is a fair and reasonable proposal."
