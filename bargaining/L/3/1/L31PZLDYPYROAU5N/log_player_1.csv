Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This offer gives me a large majority of the money, but it still leaves Bob with something. It's a good starting point to see if he'll accept or counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation. It's my turn to propose, and I'll need to offer a bit more to him, but I won't let him take the majority."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering Bob a larger share, but still keeping a significant portion for myself. This should be a good compromise, especially considering the inflation he's experiencing."
