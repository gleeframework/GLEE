"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, but I'll take a slightly bigger share this time""}

I'm proposing that I get $400,000 and Bob gets $600,000. I'm framing it as a 50/50 split, but with a slight bias towards Bob. Let's see if Bob accepts or wants to negotiate further!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more than last time, but I think this is a fair split considering the value of money is decreasing with every round. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the decreasing value of money, but I appreciate Bob's willingness to give me a bit more.

I'll think about it... Ah, okay, I'll accept this offer! I'll take $350,000 and Bob can have $650,000. It's not the best deal, but it's better than going to the next round and dealing with even more inflation.
