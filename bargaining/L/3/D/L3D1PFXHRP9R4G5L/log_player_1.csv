"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
I propose a 90/10 split in my favor, as I am the first to make an offer.  I'm hoping Bob will accept this, but I'm prepared to negotiate in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This offer is much fairer than the initial one, and it is unlikely that I will get a better deal in the future rounds.  Accepting this offer ensures I get at least half of the money, which is a good outcome considering the risk of inflation."
