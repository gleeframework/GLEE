"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
 
I propose that I receive $9000, and Bob receives $1000.  This seems like a fair starting point, as it gives Bob a small amount to consider while still leaving most of the money for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While it is not ideal to get only half of the money, it is better than rejecting the offer and potentially ending up with nothing.  The inflation will affect Bob more, so he might be willing to accept a 50/50 split in future rounds."
