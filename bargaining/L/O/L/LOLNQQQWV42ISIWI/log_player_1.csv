"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can wrap things up quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle, a fair start! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure if splitting it down the middle is the best option for me, especially since the money is worth less with each passing round. I'd like to see if I can do better."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give away the farm!""
}
```

I'm trying to balance being generous with being cautious, considering the decreasing value of money with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of Bob's offer is decreasing rapidly! 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think I'll take this offer. The value of the money is decreasing so quickly, and I'd rather have some money now than risk waiting for a better offer that might not come."
