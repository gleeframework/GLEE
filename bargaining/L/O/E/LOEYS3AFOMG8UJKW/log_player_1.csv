```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to start, and inviting Bob to consider it."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're too generous, I'll take the bigger share this time! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. If I accept, I'll get $300,000, which is worth 60% of the original amount ($500,000). But if I reject and proceed to the next round, the money will be worth 40% of the original amount, and I'll have to make a new offer.

I'll reject the offer for now.

  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bigger share, but I still want a decent chunk!""

I'll calculate the value of the money I'd get if I accept this offer: $200,000 is worth 20% of the original $1,000,000, which is a relatively small share.
