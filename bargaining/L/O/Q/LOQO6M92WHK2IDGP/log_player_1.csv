"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose to take $900,000 and give Bob $100,000.  Let's see if he thinks it's fair!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm rejecting this offer.  It's a significant drop from my initial proposal, and I think I can still get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, while I'll take $700,000.  This is a more balanced split, and I hope he'll see that it's in his best interest to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm rejecting this offer.  While it's closer to a 50/50 split, it's still significantly less than what I initially proposed, and I believe I can still do better."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, while I'll take $600,000. This is a compromise from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair split considering the inflation that has occurred."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While this is less than my initial desired outcome, the inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money.  Accepting this offer ensures I get at least something, rather than risk getting nothing at all if we continue to reject each other's offers."
