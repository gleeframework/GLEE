"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my first offer. I propose we split the money 3:2 in my favor. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

It's early in the game. There's a lot of time to negotiate and leverage the inflation factor. While a 400,000$ gain is tempting, I'm hoping to get a better share. I'll see what Alice offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I think this is a fair split, considering the potential for inflation. Let's end this quickly and both get a good deal.""}
