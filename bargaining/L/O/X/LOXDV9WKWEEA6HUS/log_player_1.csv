"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and straightforward offer. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You seemed too eager to end the game, I'll give you a slightly smaller share 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to negotiate. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that Bob's offer is fair, considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation. I'd like to propose a new offer to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think I deserve more for my patience""
}
```

I'm trying to negotiate a better deal, taking into account the reduced value of the money due to inflation. I'm offering Bob a smaller share, but still trying to get a fair deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You think you deserve more for your patience? I'm not impressed, I'll give you a smaller share still 
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to push the boundaries. Given the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 4:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think Bob's offer is a good deal, considering the significant reduction in the value of the money. I'd like to propose another offer to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share for my patience""
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise, but I'm still pushing for a slightly larger share for myself, considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation."
