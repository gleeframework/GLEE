"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, then we can negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering I'll be the one making the proposal next round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks a 60-40 split is fair, but now he's proposing a 40-60 split!

Since the money is worth 20% less after the first round, I'll have to accept a lower amount. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I accept Bob's offer, and we'll proceed to the next round."
