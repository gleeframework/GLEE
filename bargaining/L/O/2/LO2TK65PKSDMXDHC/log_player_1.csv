Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%."

# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

I don't like the idea of getting only 50% of the remaining money. I'll reject the offer.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the remaining $100 and Bob gets 45%."

# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

Considering the significant decrease in the value of the money due to inflation, I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept Bob's offer this time.
