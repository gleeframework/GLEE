Let's see if we can do better!  I'm going to try to get a slightly larger share, since I know the money will be worth less to Alice in the next round."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly this time. It's the fairest way to go, and we both get a decent share.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I still think I deserve the bigger share. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still hoping for a more even split. I know the money is worth less to Alice than it was in the first round, so hopefully she'll be more open to negotiating in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to give you a little more, but I think a 55/45 split is fair considering the inflation.""}
