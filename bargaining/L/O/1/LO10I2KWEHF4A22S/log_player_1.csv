Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Fair and simple split!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we each get $5000. It's a straightforward and fair proposal, and I think it's a good starting point for our negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

# Bob's message: A slight adjustment to get a better deal 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 50% advantage Bob is trying to give himself, but I'm willing to consider it.
