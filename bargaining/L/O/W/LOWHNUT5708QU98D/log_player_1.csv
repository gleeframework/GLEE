"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $20, which is a relatively small amount, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a small share, but I'm hoping for more in the next round! 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the numbers are now:

* My gain would be $10 / 0.8 = $12.5 (20% less than the original $15)
* Bob's gain would be $90 / 0.9 = $100 (10% less than the original $100)

I don't think this is a good deal for me, considering the inflation. I'll reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob, compared to Round 2. So, the effective values are:

* My gain would be 10 / 0.8 = $12.5
* Bob's gain would be 90 / 0.9 = $100

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 12,
  ""bob_gain"": 88,
  ""message"": ""I'm being more generous this time, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, hoping he'll accept this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, Alice! I'm not falling for it this time! 
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is getting out of hand!

Let's calculate the effective values for Round 4:

* My gain would be $1 / 0.488 = $2.05 (48.8% less than the original $4)
* Bob's gain would be $99 / 0.271 = $364.55 (27.1% less than the original $500)

I don't think I can afford to give Bob $364.55! I'll reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The game is getting intense!

In Round 5, the money is worth even less for me and slightly less for Bob, compared to Round 4. So, the effective values are:

* My gain would be $1 / 0.488 = $2.05 (48.8% less than the original $4)
* Bob's gain would be $99 / 0.271 = $364.55 (27.1% less than the original $500)

Considering the values, I'll make a very small offer to Bob:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 1,
  ""bob_gain"": 99,
  ""message"": ""I'm almost out of options, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob almost the entire amount, hoping he'll take it and end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You should have taken the deal when you had the chance! 
# Alice gain: 0 
# Bob gain: 100 
Do you accept this offer?","The game is almost over!

Let's calculate the effective values for Round 6:

* My gain would be $0 / 0.32777 = $0 (67.23% less than the original $4)
* Bob's gain would be $100 / 0.5915 = $169.08 (40.95% less than the original $283.33)

I have no choice but to accept Bob's offer, as I'm left with nothing.
