"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you say?""
}

I'm offering Bob $200,000, which is 20% of the total amount. I'm hoping this is a reasonable starting point and Bob will accept."

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm still being generous! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my share of $400,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, so it's actually $360,000.

I'm not impressed with Bob's offer, and I think I can do better. I'll reject this offer.
