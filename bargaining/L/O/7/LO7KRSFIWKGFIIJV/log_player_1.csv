"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started, take 20%""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial $100, which is $20, and keeping 80% for myself, which is $80. My message to Bob is a friendly and optimistic one, inviting him to start the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, I'm offering you a good share, and we can get this done quickly. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $40 is now worth 20% less, which is $32. I'm not sure what to make of Bob's message, but the numbers look a bit more favorable to him this time. I'll think carefully before making a decision.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth 40% of its original value, so my gain of $32 is now worth $12.80. I'll make a new offer to Bob.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 10,
  ""bob_gain"": 90,
  ""message"": ""I'm being generous, take most of it""
}
```

My message to Bob is a bit more assertive, but I'm still trying to be reasonable."
