Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll meet you halfway on my previous offer, but that's as low as I'll go 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting this offer is the most logical choice at this stage. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  Inflation is eating into Bob's potential gains at an alarming rate.  Delaying further significantly hurts Bob's position.
* **Alice's Stance:** Alice has indicated this is her lowest offer.  Holding out for a better deal is risky, as she may not budge.
* **Guaranteed Return:** Accepting guarantees Bob at least something. Rejecting and failing to reach an agreement means both sides get nothing.

While a 50/50 split would have been fairer, the impact of inflation makes accepting this offer the most rational choice for Bob at this point in the game."
