"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 60/40 split in my favor, as I am the first to propose. I believe this is a fair starting point given the potential for inflation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I propose a 50/50 split.  Since we both rejected the previous offers, a fair and equal split seems like the best way to ensure we both get something.  With the inflation, the risk of continuing is too high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though the offer is slightly less favorable than my previous offer,  the inflation is significant.  Continuing to reject could result in both of us getting nothing."
