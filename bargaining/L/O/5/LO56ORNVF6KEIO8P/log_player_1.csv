"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is a 60-40 split in my favor, but I'm willing to compromise and give Bob a significant portion of the money to try to get the game over quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'd like to adjust my decision accordingly.

I'll reject this offer, as I'd rather try to get a larger share of the money before the inflation reduces its value further.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In round 3, I'll make a new offer, taking into account the 5% reduction in value due to inflation.

Since the money is worth 5% less, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the decrease in value. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 14.26% less due to inflation, I'll need to adjust my strategy. Since Bob's offer is a 60-40 split, which is actually in my favor (as the money I gain is worth less), I'll accept this offer.
