"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This way, we both get a decent share, and I'm willing to compromise to get the game started. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me. My initial offer was already a compromise, but now I need to be more cautious. Considering the new values, I'll have to think carefully.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","The inflation is eating away at my potential gains. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

I'm trying to get a larger share of the remaining money, but I'm still willing to compromise. Your turn, Bob!"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on me now. My initial offer was already aggressive, but now I need to be even more careful.

Considering the new values, I'll have to think about the long-term consequences of rejecting this offer. If I reject, the money will be worth even less in the next round, and I might end up with nothing.

I'll accept this offer.
