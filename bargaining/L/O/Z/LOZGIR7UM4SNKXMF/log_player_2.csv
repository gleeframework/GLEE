"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 60% and you get 40%. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
Let's see if we can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think 55/45 is a fairer split. We both get a good chunk of the money, and it's a good starting point for negotiation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly. We've both lost some value, so a 50/50 split seems fair at this point. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While a 50/50 split isn't ideal, it's better than risking getting nothing at all due to further inflation."
