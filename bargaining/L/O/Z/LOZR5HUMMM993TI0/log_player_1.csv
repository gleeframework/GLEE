I'm going for a big share in the first round, hoping to secure a good deal before inflation eats away at our potential earnings. I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a decent starting point. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a tough one, but I'm going to reject this offer. Even with inflation, Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial proposal. I believe there's still room for a more equitable split, and I'm not willing to settle for this just yet."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer slightly, but still aim for a large share of the money. Bob's offer was too low, so I'm hoping this will be a more acceptable compromise. I'll offer him $200,000, hoping he'll see the value in securing something before the inflation further diminishes our gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to settle for a drastically smaller share of the money, especially with the inflation rate as high as it is. I need to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm making a final attempt to reach a compromise before the inflation gets even more severe. This offer is considerably lower than my previous proposals, but still gives Bob a significant share. I'm hoping this time he'll see that we both need to settle on a deal before we lose even more money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

The inflation is hitting hard, and I need to secure something before we both lose too much. Even with the 67% loss, Bob's offer is more than I'd get if we keep rejecting each other.  This is a painful compromise, but it's better than nothing."
