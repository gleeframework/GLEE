Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I'm willing to compromise a bit more. This offer still favors me, but it's a step closer to your proposal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement before things get too messy with inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While Alice's offer is better, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. Accepting now would set a precedent that I'm willing to take significantly less than half. It's risky, but I'm hoping she'll become more reasonable as the rounds progress and inflation diminishes the pot."
