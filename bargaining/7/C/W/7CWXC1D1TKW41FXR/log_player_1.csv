"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose a 90/10 split, favoring myself as the first mover. This should incentivize Bob to accept, as he still gets a significant amount, and the risk of rejection is high for him considering the inflation on his end."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is working against me. Accepting this offer guarantees me a substantial gain, even with the devaluation.  The risk of rejecting and facing another round with even more inflation is too high."
