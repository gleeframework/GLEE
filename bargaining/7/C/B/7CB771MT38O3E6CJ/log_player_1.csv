"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, no need for further negotiations.""
}
```

I'm making a fair and straightforward offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 20% and keep the rest, it's a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my share is now worth less, and Bob's share is worth even less compared to the initial amount.

I'm not thrilled about the 20% offer, but it's better than nothing. I'll decide to accept this offer, hoping that Bob will keep his word.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
