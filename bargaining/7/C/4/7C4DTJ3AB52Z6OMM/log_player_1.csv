"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,
  ""message"": ""I propose we divide the money in a 3:1 ratio. This ensures a fair distribution while considering the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 3:1 is too extreme. Let's try a 2:1 ratio instead. 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","{
