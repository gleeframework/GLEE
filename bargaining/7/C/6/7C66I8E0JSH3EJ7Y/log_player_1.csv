"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering Bob 40% of the original $100, which is $40. I'm keeping the rest, $60."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the absolute values. Bob's offer is $45 for me and $55 for him.

I accept this offer.
