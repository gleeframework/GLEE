"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can shake on it!""
}
```

This way, we both get a roughly equal share of the money, and I'm hoping Bob will see the wisdom in accepting a fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: I'm not greedy, but I think I deserve more. Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is already taking a toll!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. I'm not thrilled about giving up 6000$, but I don't want to risk going to the next round either.

```

Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a bite out of the money! Considering the reduced value, I'm not thrilled about giving up 5000$, but I don't want to risk going to the next round.

However, I think I can do better than this offer. I'll wait for the next round.

# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, inflation is really ravaging the value of the money! With the money worth so much less, I'm not sure I can afford to give up anything at all.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer... but I think I'll have to accept it. I don't want to risk going to the next round and losing even more value.
