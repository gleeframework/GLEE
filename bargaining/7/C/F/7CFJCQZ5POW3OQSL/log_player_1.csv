"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $30, which is a generous 30% of the total, while I'll take $70, which is 70% of the total. I'm hoping Bob will accept this fair offer and we can end the game here!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is decreasing, so I need to be more careful with my decisions.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""It's now or never, Bob! Let's split it 50/50!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 50/50 split, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game here."
