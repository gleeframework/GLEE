"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

Let's start with an even split. I believe fairness is important, and this way both of us get a good amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
 
While I'd prefer a more even split, I'm not sure I can get a better deal in the future. It's better to secure at least something than to risk getting nothing."
