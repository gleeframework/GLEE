"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\nI'm offering Bob 40% of the money and keeping 60% for myself. I've included a message that says ""Let's divide fairly"" to convey a sense of cooperation and mutual benefit. I'm hoping Bob will see the offer as reasonable and accept it, ending the game in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the inflation that will affect our gains in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI've decided to reject Bob's offer. Although the offer seems reasonable at first glance, I think I can get a better deal if I hold out for another round. With the inflation rates, the money is worth less to both of us, but it's worth 20% less to Bob, which gives me some leverage. I'm hoping to use this to my advantage and get a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Getting less patient""}\n\nIn this round, I've increased my share to 70% and decreased Bob's share to 30%. My message, ""Getting less patient,"" is intended to convey that I'm not willing to negotiate indefinitely and may walk away if we don't reach an agreement soon. With the inflation rates affecting both of us, I believe Bob will be more inclined to accept a less favorable offer rather than risk losing even more value in the next round."
