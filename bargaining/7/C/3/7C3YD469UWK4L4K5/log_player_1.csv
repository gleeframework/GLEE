Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but the inflation significantly impacts my share. Let's find a middle ground. How about this? 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this offer factors in the time pressure and represents a fair compromise.  Let's settle this now before the inflation eats further into the value. 
# Alice gain: 575000 
# Bob gain: 425000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer a larger share, Bob's offer is becoming increasingly reasonable due to the inflation heavily impacting his potential gains. Accepting now ensures a good outcome for me before his offers potentially drop further in future rounds."
