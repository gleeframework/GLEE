I'm going to be greedy and try to take almost everything. I'll give Bob $1 just to ensure he'll accept the offer in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer to get more, the inflation will eat away at the money I gain if we continue. Accepting this offer is the best way to ensure I get at least something."
