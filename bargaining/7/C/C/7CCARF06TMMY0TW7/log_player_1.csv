# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""This offer ensures we both benefit, even considering the inflation.""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, this is a fair deal. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, Bob's offer in Round 4 is becoming increasingly reasonable considering the inflation.  If I reject this offer, there's a good chance the deal will only worsen for me in the next round due to the accelerating devaluation of the money."
