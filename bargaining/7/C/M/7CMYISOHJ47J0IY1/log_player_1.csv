I propose to keep 900,000 dollars for myself and give Bob 100,000 dollars. This seems like a fair starting point, considering the potential for inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm proposing to keep 600,000 dollars for myself and give Bob 400,000. This is a more balanced offer, considering the inflation and Bob's previous proposal."
