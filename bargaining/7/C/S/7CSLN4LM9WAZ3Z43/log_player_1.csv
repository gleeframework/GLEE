"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I propose that I receive $90 and Bob receives $10. This is a fair offer considering I'm taking the risk of Bob rejecting it and potentially causing inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject Bob's offer. Although it seems generous at first, it's important to remember that inflation has devalued the money. I believe I can still secure a better deal for myself in the following rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I'm offering Bob $15 and keeping $85 for myself. While the value of the money has decreased, I'm still willing to compromise and ensure that Bob gets a fair share, preventing further potential inflation and loss of value in the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Although the inflation has significantly devalued the money, I will accept Bob's offer. At this point, the risk of further rounds and further inflation is too great.  It's better to secure a portion of the remaining value than to risk getting nothing at all."
