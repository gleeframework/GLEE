I'm going to propose a 900,000 - 100,000 split in my favor.  It's a good starting point, but I'm aware of the inflation, so I'm not pushing for too much.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting this offer. While it seems tempting to take something, even with inflation, I believe I can get a better deal by continuing.  I'm willing to take a chance, as the inflation is affecting Bob less than it is affecting me.  The next round is my opportunity to propose a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 720000, ""bob_gain"": 280000}
```

I'm going to propose a 720,000 - 280,000 split in my favor.  I'm factoring in the inflation from the previous rounds, and I'm aiming for a decent gain, but not being greedy.  Let's see if Bob is willing to compromise."
