Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm starting with a proposal that favors me a bit, but still gives Bob something. I'm hoping that he'll accept, especially since he doesn't know about the inflation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Even though Bob's offer is more favorable to me than the first round, it is still not worth it considering the inflation. I am confident that I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm increasing my share slightly from the previous round, hoping to find a middle ground. The inflation is hitting me hard, so I need to get a good deal before it gets worse."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough one. While the inflation is making my share worth significantly less, I'm running out of bargaining power. A 50/50 split is the best I can likely get at this point.  It's time to accept and move on."
