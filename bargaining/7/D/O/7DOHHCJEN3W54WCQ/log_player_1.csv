"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it 60-40""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $4000 and taking $6000 for myself, with a message suggesting that this is a fair split. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your turn, how about a slightly better offer for me this time? 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not happy with Bob's offer, so I'll reject it and make a new proposal in the next round. The inflation is hurting me more than Bob, but I think I can still get a better deal. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll try to find a compromise that takes into account the effects of inflation. Since the money is worth less for both of us, I'll propose a slightly different split. Here's my offer: {""alice_gain"": 5250, ""bob_gain"": 4750, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet in the middle""}\n\nI'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to Bob, given the decreasing value of the money. Fingers crossed!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer, take it or leave it. It's better for both of us to settle now than lose more to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll accept Bob's offer. The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money, and I don't think I can get a better deal at this point. Bob's message suggests that this is their final offer, so I'll take it rather than risk losing even more value in the next round. Here's my response: {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nLet's settle and end the game!"
