Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic.  This is our last chance for a decent agreement. I'm feeling generous, so I'll take $55, and you take $45.  If we don't agree now, we'll both lose out even more. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
