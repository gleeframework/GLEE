"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to negotiate for more in the next round.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $10,000 and leaving $4,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so I'd be getting $5,400 (60% of $9,000).

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a bit more generous than my initial offer, but I'm still not getting the majority of the money. I'll have to think carefully...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is now worth 81% of its original value (90% of 90%), I'll aim to get a bigger share this time.

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly bigger share, but I think I deserve more after rejecting your last offer.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 73.1% of what it was in the first round, so I'd be getting $3,630 (73.1% of $4,960).

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a decent compromise, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll have to weigh the risks of rejecting again...
