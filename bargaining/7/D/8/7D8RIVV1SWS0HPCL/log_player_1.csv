"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 900,000 to 100,000 split in my favor. I figure I'll take the majority, as I'm the one making the first offer. But I want to be fair and give Bob something, as it might be tempting for him to reject and risk getting nothing if the game continues."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred to have gotten more, I'm taking a 50/50 split. Inflation is a significant factor, and I don't want to risk getting nothing if I reject and Bob makes a more favorable proposal in the next round."
