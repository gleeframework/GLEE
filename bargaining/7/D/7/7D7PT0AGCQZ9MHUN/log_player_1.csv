Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 equally, with each of us getting $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I deserve a slightly bigger share since I'm taking the risk of rejection. But I'm still being fair. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with the uneven split, and I think Bob is taking advantage of the fact that I made the first offer. I'd like to make a new proposal to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
