Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation to her advantage. While her offer might seem tempting as time goes on, it's crucial to remember that accepting an unfair deal just because of the decreasing value is a losing strategy. There's still a chance to negotiate a better outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""I'm willing to be flexible, but this offer considers the time pressure and the decreasing value.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time pressure:**  With only 6 rounds left, the stakes are higher. 
* **Balancing act:**  I need to offer something that seems appealing to Alice (better than her previous offer) while acknowledging the decreasing value for myself. 
* **Future leverage:** By offering a bit more than before, I'm hoping to show Alice I'm willing to negotiate, but also setting a slightly better starting point for future rounds if this offer is rejected."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is eating away, take it while you can 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough one. The pressure is definitely on with the shrinking pot. However, Alice is still clearly trying to take advantage of the situation. There's a chance she'll panic as we get closer to the deadline and offer something better. I'm willing to gamble a little longer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 47, ""alice_gain"": 53, ""message"": ""We're running out of time. This is a reasonable compromise considering the circumstances.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency:**  With only four rounds left, the risk of getting nothing is very real. 
* **Slight Concession:** Offering 47% shows I'm serious about reaching a deal, but not desperate enough to accept a bad one.
* **Appeal to Logic:**  The message emphasizes the time pressure and the fact that this is a compromise, not a complete surrender."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing a lot to inflation, don't be stubborn 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a difficult decision, but with only three rounds left, the risk of getting nothing is very high. While Alice is still getting the better end of the deal, accepting 45% now is better than potentially losing everything. The inflation is significantly impacting the potential gains, and holding out for a slightly better offer might not be worth the risk."
