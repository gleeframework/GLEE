"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share this round, but hopefully we can find a more even split later on. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
 
While it's tempting to take $1000, it's a very small share, and the value of the money will decrease significantly if I reject. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
