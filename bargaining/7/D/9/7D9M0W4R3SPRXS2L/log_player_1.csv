"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation factor in mind, I'll evaluate Bob's offer.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm essentially getting 5000 dollars in today's value. Bob's offer would give me 4000 dollars, which is 20% less than what I was initially aiming for.

I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

I'm trying to take a slightly larger share, considering the inflation factor is still in effect. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation factor affecting Bob's gain more severely, I'll re-evaluate the offer.

Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'm essentially getting 5000 dollars in today's value. Bob's offer would give me 4500 dollars, which is a slight decrease from what I was initially aiming for.

However, considering the increasing inflation rate, I'll take this offer.
