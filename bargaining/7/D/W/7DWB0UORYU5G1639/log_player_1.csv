"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $30, which is a relatively small amount, leaving me with $70. This way, we can both have a decent amount to start with, and I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable offer and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, no need to negotiate 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, my gain of $70 in the first round is now equivalent to $63 in the second round.

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a fair proposal to meet in the middle. I'll accept his offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
