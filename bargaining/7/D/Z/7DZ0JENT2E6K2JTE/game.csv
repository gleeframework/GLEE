,,,Alice,2,reject
600000.0,400000.0,I propose we divide the money with a slight advantage for me. It's still a fair deal considering the diminishing value of money in each round.,Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"I'll give you a slightly better deal than before, but I'm not going to give up too much. You're still getting a decent chunk of the money.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
650000.0,350000.0,"I think it's fair to give you a bit more this time. After all, you've been getting less each round due to inflation.",Alice,5,

520000.0,480000.0,"I'll give you a slightly better deal than before, but I'm not going to give up too much. You're still getting a decent chunk of the money. Let's see if you can do better than this.",Bob,6,

620000.0,380000.0,"I'm getting desperate, but I'm still not willing to give up too much. You're getting a decent chunk of the money, but I'm not going to let you have it all. Let's see if you can do better than this.",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
800000.0,200000.0,This might be my last offer. I believe it's a fair compromise considering the inflation rate. I hope you can see the logic behind it.,Alice,11,
