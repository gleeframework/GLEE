"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my opening offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $100, leaving Bob with 40%. This is a relatively generous offer, considering I'm the one making the first proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is a bit more aggressive, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll think carefully about this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","With the money worth 10% less than in the second round, I'll aim for a slightly higher percentage for myself. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}"
