# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's better to see what Alice is willing to offer in the next round. I can always accept a similar deal later if I need to."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for inflation. Will you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While the offer is closer to what I proposed, I'm not sure if Alice is willing to compromise further. I'll see what she offers next round."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway this time. This is a fair deal for both of us, considering the inflation. Let's finish this.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: It's time to split it down the middle. No more negotiating, let's just divide it evenly. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

With the inflation, the money is worth less every round.  It's time to take a guaranteed 50% instead of risking a worse offer."
