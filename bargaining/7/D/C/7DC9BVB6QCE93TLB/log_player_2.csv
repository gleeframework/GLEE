# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for a better offer. It's only Round 1, and I'm not desperate yet! Besides, I know the money is worth 10% less to Alice with each passing round, so I have some leverage. Bring on Round 2!"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I'll take a bit more than half. You can still get a decent amount, and it's better than nothing! Remember, the money is losing value for you...""}\n\n###\n\nNow it's my turn! I'll make a more reasonable offer, considering the circumstances. Alice should be motivated to accept, given the decreasing value of the money for her. Let's see how she reacts!"

# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer as well. Alice is trying to create a sense of urgency, but I'm not buying it.

I'll take a bit more this time. You should consider accepting before it's too late...""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I'll increase my share slightly, putting more pressure on Alice to accept.

# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer again. Alice is trying to appeal to my sense of fairness, but I'm not convinced. The money may be losing value for her, but I'm still in a strong position. I'll keep pushing for a better deal, as I have 7 more rounds to negotiate. The pressure is on Alice, not me! Bring on Round 6!"

I'll take an even bigger share this time. You should accept before it's too late...""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I'll increase my share again, taking advantage of Alice's weakening position.

It was a good game, and I'm happy with the outcome!"
