Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable, Alice. How about a 65/35 split in your favor? This accounts for the time value of money. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
