"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, it's a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems like a fair and reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the lead, you can get a smaller share this time 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 10% less, so I need to be more careful with my decisions.

I don't like the 60-40 split, as it's not as favorable to me as the 50-50 split I proposed earlier. I'll reject this offer and try to do better next time.

```
{

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a better offer this time. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a higher percentage of the remaining amount.

```

  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You took the lead last time, now it's my turn again""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting less, but it's still a good deal 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really eating away at my potential gains!

I don't like this offer at all. The 30-70 split is even more unfavorable to me than the 40-60 split in the previous round. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time, considering the continued inflation.

  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not getting any younger, let's make a deal""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, you'll get a smaller one, but it's still a fair deal 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains. I'm getting desperate, but I still want to try to get a better deal.

I don't like this offer at all. The 20-80 split is extremely unfavorable to me, and I'm not sure if I can afford to give up so much more. I'll reject this offer and hope that Bob will make a more reasonable proposal next time.
