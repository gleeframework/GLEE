**Reasoning:**

Alice is stubbornly sticking close to her initial offer, even though the value of the money is decreasing significantly.  I'm hoping that by continuing to reject her offers, she'll become more willing to make a significant concession as we get closer to the deadline."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""This is ridiculous.  Let's just split it evenly and call it a day.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice doesn't seem willing to budge much from her initial offer, even though it's getting worse for both of us as time goes on. Offering a 50/50 split is fair, and hopefully, the clear frustration in my message will push her to accept before we both lose out."
