"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'm willing to give you a good deal!""
}

# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my $6,000 is now worth $5,700 (since 95% of $6,000).

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
