Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split, with me receiving $900,000 and Bob receiving $100,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the potential for inflation in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I would have preferred a larger share, it's better to accept this offer.  Even with the 10% inflation,  $200,000 is a significant gain, and the next round might be even worse."
