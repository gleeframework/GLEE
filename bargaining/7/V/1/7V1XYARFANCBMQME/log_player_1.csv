"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I think we can both agree on this.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I get 60 dollars and Bob gets 40 dollars. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fair, considering the inflation factor. Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 55-45 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'm going to try to negotiate a better deal.

I'll respond with:

{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""I'm not sure 55/45 is fair, considering the inflation factor. Can we meet in the middle at 50/50?""}

I'm hoping Bob will be willing to compromise and meet me at a 50-50 split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 55-45, I'm going to try to counter with a 50-50 split. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""I think we should meet in the middle and split it 50/50. It's a fair compromise considering the inflation factor.""}

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finally settle on a division."
