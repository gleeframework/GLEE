"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $500,000. This is a fair and straightforward offer, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 400k, but I think I deserve more! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer. With the 20% inflation, the $400,000 I'd get is actually worth $320,000, and the $600,000 Bob would get is worth $480,000. That's a significant difference!

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the disparity in our potential gains. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I think 58/42 is a fair split!""

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal than the 50/50 split I proposed in round 1."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money!

Considering the offer, I'd get $300,000, which is worth about $196,800 in today's value, and Bob would get $700,000, which is worth about $462,800. That's a significant difference, but I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the disparity.
