"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a small portion to get us started.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 ratio, giving me the majority of the initial $10,000, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount to get us started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent share, but I'm not giving away too much too soon. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I need to adjust my thinking.

The $4000 I would gain is worth 95% of the original $4000 (since it's 5% less due to inflation), which is $3800.

The $6000 Bob would gain is worth 80% of the original $6000 (since it's 20% less due to inflation), which is $4800.

I'm not thrilled about giving up a significant amount, but it's still a decent offer. I'll accept it.
