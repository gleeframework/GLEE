"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, we can re-evaluate later""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm suggesting we revisit the division later if we're not satisfied with the current split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started high, I'll meet you in the middle 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the effective values are:

Alice's gain: 4000 / 0.9 = 4444.44
Bob's gain: 6000 / 0.95 = 6315.79

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll aim to get a bit more. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""Meeting you in the middle, but I'm willing to give a bit more to you this time""
}
```"
