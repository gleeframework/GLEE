"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
``` 
 
I propose to keep $9,000 for myself and give $1,000 to Bob.  This is a fair starting point, considering the inflation factor that favors him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
This offer is a fair split, and while I might get a little more in the next round due to inflation, it's not worth risking a rejection and ending up with nothing."
