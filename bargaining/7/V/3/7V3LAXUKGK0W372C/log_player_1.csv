"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40. You can have the first move if you don't like it.""
}

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: I'll take 55% of the remaining pie. Your turn to decide. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced values, I'm not too thrilled about Bob's offer. I'd rather try to get a better deal. I'll reject his offer and make a counter-proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 45% if you give me 55%""
