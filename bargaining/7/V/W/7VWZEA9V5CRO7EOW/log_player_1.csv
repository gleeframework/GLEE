"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly lower offer, but still a decent split. Consider it! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to consider the impact of inflation. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, I'll need to think about whether $3000 is still a good deal for me.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer, hoping that I can do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher share this time. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation!""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think I'm still being fair. Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains! Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

However, since the money I gain is worth significantly less than before, I'll have to consider whether $3500 is still a good deal for me.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer, hoping it's the best I can get under the current circumstances."
