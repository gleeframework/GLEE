# Alice's message: You're running out of time, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the time pressure is on, accepting this offer would mean I get even less than before due to inflation.  Alice is clearly trying to exploit the situation. It's a risk, but I need to hold out for a better deal."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're really losing out now, take this before it's too late 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The relentless march of inflation is killing me. While 44 is much less than I wanted, rejecting this offer and hoping for something better in the later rounds is incredibly risky. Alice knows the clock is working against me and might not budge any further. It's a bitter pill to swallow, but better to get something than nothing at all."
