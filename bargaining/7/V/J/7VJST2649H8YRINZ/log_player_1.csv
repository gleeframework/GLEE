While this offer is closer to an even split, it's still significantly less than what I was offered in the first round, and I'm not willing to accept such a substantial loss due to inflation."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

While this offer is far less than what I initially proposed, the inflation has become a significant factor.  An even split is the best I can expect at this point, given the dwindling value of the money."
