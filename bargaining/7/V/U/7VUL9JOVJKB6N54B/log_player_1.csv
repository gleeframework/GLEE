"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 90-10, a fair start""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 10% share, which is $100,000, and keeping the remaining 90% for myself, which is $900,000. My message to Bob is that this is a fair starting point, and we can negotiate further if he's not satisfied."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. I'll take 90% this round, and we can work out a better split later. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to flip the script on me!

I'll reject this offer. I'd rather not give him 90% of the remaining $900,000, which is now worth $810,000 due to inflation. My gain would be only $100,000, which is not a good deal for me.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Time for a counterattack!

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's compromise""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 30% share, which is $300,000, and keeping the remaining 70% for myself, which is $700,000. My message to Bob is that this is a more balanced offer, and we can work out a better split later."
