"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can split the money quickly!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're going to regret rejecting my generous offer! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not going to regret it!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than 30% of the remaining value of the money. The inflation is already affecting the money's value, and I want to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3

  ""message"": ""You're getting desperate, aren't you? Take this offer and we can end this!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 42% of the remaining value of the money, which is a slight increase from my previous offer. Let's see if Bob will take it!"

# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to wait for the money to devalue further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than 45% of the remaining value of the money. The inflation is still affecting the money's value, and I want to try to get a better deal before it's too late."

# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is still holding out for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than 48% of the remaining value of the money. The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value, and I want to try to get a better deal before it's too late."

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting close to desperation, Bob. Take this offer and we can finally end this!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 52% of the remaining value of the money, which is a slight increase from my previous offer. Let's see if Bob will take it!"

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: You're not getting any closer to winning, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 510000 
# Bob gain: 490000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is still trying to outwait me.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer because I think I've reached a point where the potential gains are too small to be worth the risk of waiting for a better offer. The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value, and I'd rather take a slightly lower percentage of the remaining value than risk getting even less."
