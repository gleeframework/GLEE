"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I am proposing I take $85 and you get $15. Consider the inflation - it's better to take a sure deal now. 
# Bob gain: 15 
# Alice gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Alice, your offer was heavily skewed in your favor. I'm proposing a more reasonable split this time.  Let's be fair and avoid this thing dragging on.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic.  My offer accounts for the fact that the value decreases for me each round. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. We both lose out if we don't reach an agreement. A 50/50 split is the only fair option at this point.""}
