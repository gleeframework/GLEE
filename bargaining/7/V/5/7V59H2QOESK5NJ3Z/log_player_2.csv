Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.

``` 

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in Round 5 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Severe Inflation:** Inflation is hitting Bob significantly harder than Alice. Waiting any longer will drastically reduce Bob's potential gains.
* **Declining Offers:** Alice's offers have been getting steadily worse for Bob. It's unlikely she'll offer a better deal in subsequent rounds.
* **Certainty vs. Risk:** Accepting the current offer guarantees Bob a reasonable sum. Rejecting it carries the risk of ending up with an even smaller amount if negotiations completely break down. 

While getting only 35% isn't ideal, it's better than risking getting even less as inflation eats away at the value.
