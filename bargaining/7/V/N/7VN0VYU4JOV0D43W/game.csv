40.0,60.0,"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think we can both do better. I'm proposing we split the money 60/40 in my favor. This reflects the fact that the money is worth less to you in the future rounds.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.",Bob,2,

This reflects the reality of the situation and gives you a chance to walk away with something.  It's time to be realistic and end this before we lose everything.",Bob,6,
