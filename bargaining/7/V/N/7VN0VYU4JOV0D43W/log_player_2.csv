"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money fairly, Bob. I think this is a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. While it seems fair on the surface, I know the money is worth less to Alice in the future rounds. I'm going to try and negotiate a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think we can both do better. I'm proposing we split the money 60/40 in my favor. This reflects the fact that the money is worth less to you in the future rounds.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your point about the declining value, but your offer wasn't fair to me. This offer is a compromise, let's close this deal and avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

I'm still going to reject this offer. While it's closer to what I want, I think I can still get a better deal. The money is losing value faster for Alice, and I'm confident I can get more in a future round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Alice, we're both losing money with each passing round.  I'm sticking with my previous proposal â€“ a 70/30 split in my favor.  This recognizes the faster rate of inflation for you, and ensures we both walk away with something. Let's end this now and avoid further losses.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm proposing a straight 50/50 split to end this now.  Any further delays hurt us both.  Let's be reasonable and get this money. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

I'm still going to reject this offer.  While 50/50 seems fair on the surface, remember that the money is worth a lot less to Alice than it is to me. I'm going to hold out for a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 75, ""alice_gain"": 25, ""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking.  We're both losing money with each passing round.  This is my final offer - a 75/25 split in my favor. This reflects the reality of the situation and gives you a chance to walk away with something.  It's time to be realistic and end this before we lose everything.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be reasonable, but you're leaving me no choice.  This is my final offer -  a 45/55 split.  Take it or leave it, but the clock is ticking for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

Alice's offer is the best I can expect at this point. While I'd prefer a larger share, the clock is ticking, and further delays will hurt us both. This offer at least ensures I walk away with something substantial."
