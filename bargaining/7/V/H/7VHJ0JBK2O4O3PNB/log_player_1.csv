Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your split seems unfair to me given the inflation rates. I propose a 52/48 split in my favor. This way, we both lose less money overall due to inflation.  What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250
