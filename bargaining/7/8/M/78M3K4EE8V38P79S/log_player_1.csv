Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. It's a fair starting point, given the potential for inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
``` 

I'll offer a slightly more balanced split of 85/15 this time. While inflation has impacted my gains, I'm still willing to compromise to reach an agreement."
