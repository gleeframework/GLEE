"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject the offer. While it seems fair on the surface, I know that the money will be worth less to me in the future rounds. I'm hoping to get a better deal later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm offering you a bit less this time, but the money is worth less to me now. It's in both of our best interests to reach a deal before the value diminishes further.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. This is a good offer considering the inflation working against you. We should make a deal soon. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
While I appreciate the effort to meet halfway, Alice's offer is still too low considering the inflation factor working against me.  I'm hoping to reach a more favorable deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Alice, we're both losing money with each passing round. Let's split the money evenly and avoid further losses. This is the best deal we can get now.""}
