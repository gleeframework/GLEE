"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! I'm offering you $2000, a fair share, and I'll take the rest.""
}
```

This way, I get the majority of the money, but still offer Bob a decent amount to keep him engaged."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet you halfway, let's start with a fair split 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $8000 is still worth $8000, but Bob's gain of $2000 is now worth $1800.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll accept it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

It's a fair split, and I'm willing to compromise to get the game moving."
