"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I believe a more equitable split would be 5500 for me and 4500 for you.  This reflects the fact that the inflation penalty is higher for you, so I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share.  Let's see if we can agree on this for a fair and quick resolution. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
