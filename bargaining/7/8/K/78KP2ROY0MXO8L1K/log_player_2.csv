Alice's offer:

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I believe a more equitable split would be 5500 for me and 4500 for you.  This reflects the fact that the inflation penalty is higher for you, so I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share.  Let's see if we can agree on this for a fair and quick resolution.""}

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the inflation impacts us differently, but your previous offer wasn't fair to me.  This offer takes both our positions into account and ensures a quicker resolution that benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800
