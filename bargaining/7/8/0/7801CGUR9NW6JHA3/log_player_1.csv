"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my opening offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 5% less, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 30 / 0.95 = 31.58
* Bob gain: 70 / 0.95 = 73.68

I'll accept this offer.
