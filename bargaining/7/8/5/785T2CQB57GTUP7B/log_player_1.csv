"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose to keep 90 dollars and give Bob 10 dollars. I figure this is a fair starting point, as it gives Bob a small amount to incentivize him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred to get more, I think this is a fair deal considering inflation. Accepting this offer guarantees me 50 dollars, which is better than risking getting nothing if we keep rejecting each other's offers."
