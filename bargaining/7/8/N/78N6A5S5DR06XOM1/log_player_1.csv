"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}
``` 
I propose taking 99% of the money and giving Bob the remaining 1%.  Since I'm starting, I want to ensure a good chunk of the money for myself, but I'm also being somewhat generous to Bob in hopes of a quick agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would prefer to have a larger share, accepting this offer guarantees me $500,000, which is still a substantial amount. Considering the inflation, I might not get a better offer in the next round."
