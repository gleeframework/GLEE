"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split in my favor is more fair.  Since we're both starting to lose money, it's better to reach a deal now. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
