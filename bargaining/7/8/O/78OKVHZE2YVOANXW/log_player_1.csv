"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to try and get a large portion of the money in the first round.  I'll offer Bob a small amount, but enough that it might be tempting for him to accept.  Let's see how this goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I'd prefer a larger share, it's getting risky to reject offers.  This is a fair split, and it's better to take it than risk losing everything."
