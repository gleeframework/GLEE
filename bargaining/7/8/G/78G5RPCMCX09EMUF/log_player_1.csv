"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to get the negotiation started!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to get the ball rolling. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent chunk, but I'm not going to give up too much control 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

Considering the offer, I think I'll have to be a bit more cautious. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a pretty big gap, Bob. I'm not sure I'm comfortable with such an uneven split.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob. Let's find a fair compromise!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still aiming for a slightly higher share for myself to account for the inflation. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not budging much 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll!

Considering the offer, I think I'll have to be even more cautious. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's still a pretty big gap, Bob. I'm not sure I'm willing to accept such a small increase.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation. Let's meet in the middle again!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a fair split, but I'm still trying to get a slightly higher share to compensate for the erosion of value due to inflation. Your turn, Bob!"
