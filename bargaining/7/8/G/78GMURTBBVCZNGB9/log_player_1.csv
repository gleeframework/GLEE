"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I'm offering Bob 40% of the total amount, which is a fair share considering the game is just starting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less for Bob, he's trying to take advantage of the situation. However, I think I can do better.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob's offer was quite lopsided, I'll try to make a more balanced offer this time. Here it is:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

This way, I'm offering Bob a smaller share, but still a significant one, and keeping a larger share for myself."

Round 4

# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to make a comeback after my previous offer was rejected. However, I'm not convinced by his new offer. The money is worth significantly less for Bob now, so I think I can do better.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the money being worth less and less for Bob, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time. Here it is:

I'm taking a bigger share, but I think it's justified given the decreasing value of the money for Bob."
