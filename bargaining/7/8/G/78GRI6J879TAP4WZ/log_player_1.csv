"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leaving $4,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Not bad, but I want a bigger share! 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth 5% less for me, $2,500 is actually equivalent to $2,500 / 0.95 = $2,631.58 in the first round's value. But since the value of the money is decreasing, I'll have to be cautious.

I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal.
