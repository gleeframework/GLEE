"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000 and leave Bob with $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","My offer from round 1 was rejected, and now Bob is making a counteroffer. Considering the inflation, I'll evaluate Bob's offer.

Since my gain would be worth 20% less than in the first round, and Bob's gain would be worth 5% less, I'll calculate the actual values:

My gain: 4500 * 0.8 = 3600
Bob's gain: 5500 * 0.95 = 5225

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, as it's a bit closer to an even split than my initial offer. I'll reject it and make a new proposal.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth less now. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the remaining $10,000 and leave Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since my gain would be worth 48.8% less than in the first round, and Bob's gain would be worth 14.26% less, I'll calculate the actual values:

My gain: 4000 * 0.5162 = 2065.28
Bob's gain: 6000 * 0.8554 = 5132.4

Considering the inflation, this offer is actually a bit more favorable to me than my previous offer, and it's closer to an even split. I'll accept this offer.
