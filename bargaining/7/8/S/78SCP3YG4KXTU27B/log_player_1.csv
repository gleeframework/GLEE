"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll consider the effective value of the offer. If I accept this offer, I'll get 55% of the remaining value, which is approximately 55% of $90 (since $100 is worth 90% of its original value due to inflation).

Considering the reduced value, I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer was 55:45, I'll try to adjust my proposal to make it more favorable to myself. I'll aim for a slightly better ratio.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42}

I'm proposing that I get 58% of the remaining $100 and Bob gets 42%."
