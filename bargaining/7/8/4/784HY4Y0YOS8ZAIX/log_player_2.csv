"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being fair, but this is a lot of money! Let's get this over with. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
