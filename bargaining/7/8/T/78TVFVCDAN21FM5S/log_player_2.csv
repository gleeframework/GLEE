Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting closer, don't let inflation win 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is stubbornly sticking close to her original offer, even though the value is steadily decreasing. While the gap is narrowing, it's time to show I'm serious about getting a more equitable deal.  The rounds are slipping by, and I need to push her to be more realistic."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""This is it - a perfectly equal split.  Let's end this before inflation eats away at the value any further.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I've rejected several offers now, showing Alice I'm serious about a better deal.  By offering a 50/50 split, I'm demonstrating fairness and a willingness to compromise.  This offer is simple, clear, and emphasizes the urgency of the situation as inflation continues to erode the value. This should be tempting enough for Alice to accept."
