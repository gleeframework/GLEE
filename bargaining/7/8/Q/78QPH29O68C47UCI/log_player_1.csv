Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to be fair, but a 60/40 split recognizes that I took the initial risk. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000

{
""alice_gain"": 480000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's settle this now. This is a reasonable compromise to avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 440000 
# Bob gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, Bob's offer is now getting closer to a 50/50 split.  The longer we wait, the less the money is worth. Accepting a slightly less favorable split now mitigates further losses due to inflation."
