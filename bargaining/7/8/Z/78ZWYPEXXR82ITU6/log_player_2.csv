Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Let's split it more evenly this time.  We have a lot of rounds left, and I don't want to see my share shrink further. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm being generous. Don't push your luck. This is my final offer.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm still willing to meet you halfway.  Let's split the difference from the last offer. Time is running out, and neither of us wants to lose everything. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It's time to cut my losses. Alice is clearly aiming for a 55/45 split, and with inflation eating into my potential gains each round, it's better to take a decent offer now than risk getting nothing later.
