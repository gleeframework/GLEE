Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice rejected my previous offer, I'll try to be more aggressive this time. Here's my new offer:

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, the actual values are:

* Alice's offer: Bob gets $45, which is worth $36.90 in real money, and Alice gets $55, which is worth $49.45 in real money.
* My initial offer in round 2 was Bob getting $60, which is worth $58.40 in real money, and Alice getting $40, which is worth $34.40 in real money.

Since Alice's offer is closer to the real value of my initial offer, and considering the inflation, I'll accept her offer this time.
