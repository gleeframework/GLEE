Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

I propose taking $9,000 and giving Bob $1,000.  This is a good starting point that allows for potential negotiation in the future."

Do you accept this offer?","```json

I reject the offer. While it's a more even split, I still believe I can get a better deal for myself. The inflation doesn't affect my gains this round, so I'm in a strong position to negotiate."

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
