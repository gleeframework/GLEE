Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** This is a tough spot, but Alice is clearly exploiting the inflation disadvantage. While it's tempting to take $300,000, waiting one more round might force her hand. If she continues this trend, I'll be left with almost nothing in round 6, which would make her offer impossible to refuse.  This might make her reconsider a more even split in the next round."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""It's my last reasonable offer, Alice.  Take it or leave it.""}
```

**Reasoning:**  The inflation is killing me. I need to make a move now before my position is completely eroded. Offering her the same 60/40 split she initially offered shows I'm willing to compromise, but this is my final stand. If she rejects this, I'm in a terrible position in Round 7 where the inflation will have eaten away most of my potential gains."
