"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

I propose a 9000/1000 split, giving me the lion's share but still leaving Bob with something.  This seems like a fair starting point, considering I'm taking the risk of proposing first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject this offer. While it's tempting to take $1000, it's not a good long-term strategy. If I keep rejecting, Bob's offers will get increasingly worse due to inflation. It's better to continue playing and see if I can get a more favorable split later on."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer slightly to 8000/2000.  I'm still aiming for a majority share, but I want to signal that I'm willing to compromise.  Bob's rejection of my first offer showed that he wants a larger share, and I'm trying to meet him halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still going to reject this offer. While it's frustrating that Bob seems to be playing a game of ""I'll take 80% or nothing,"" I'm confident that his offers will continue to get worse with each passing round. I'm going to keep holding out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again to 7000/3000.  I'm starting to feel the pressure of the shrinking time, but I'm still hoping to get a significant share of the money.  This offer is a further compromise, but I'm still holding out for a deal that's more equitable than what Bob has been offering."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still going to reject this offer. Bob is clearly holding out for an almost entirely one-sided split, but his offers are getting progressively worse.  With each passing round, the pressure to accept something is mounting, but I'm going to continue rejecting until we reach a more balanced agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm lowering my offer one last time to 6000/4000. Time is running out, and I need to be realistic about the possibility of getting a larger share.  This offer still gives me a significant advantage, but it also acknowledges that Bob has been holding out for a more even split. Hopefully, this compromise will be enough to secure a deal before the remaining time runs out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I accept this offer. Although I'm getting significantly less than I initially wanted, the inflation is getting severe.  It's better to secure at least $4000 than risk getting nothing at all if we continue to reject each other's offers."
