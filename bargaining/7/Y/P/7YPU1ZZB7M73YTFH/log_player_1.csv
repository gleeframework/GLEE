Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split considering the inflation.  I'm willing to give you a little more, but I need a good portion of the money to be worthwhile for me. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger share to make it worth my while.  Let's try to reach a deal before the inflation eats away too much of our potential gains. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Even with inflation, Bob's offer is getting worse for me.  It's important to hold strong and demonstrate that I'm aiming for a fairer split, especially as he is impacted by inflation more significantly than I am."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time! Inflation is hurting us both. I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to get a fair share.  Let's make this deal and stop losing money. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting desperate, which is understandable given the inflation hitting him harder. However, his offer is still heavily skewed in his favor. I need to show resolve, but time is also becoming a factor. I'll need to make a more significant concession soon to avoid walking away with nothing."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the fairest option considering the circumstances. Take it or leave it, we're running out of time!""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

The pressure is on! I'm making a significant concession by offering a 50/50 split.  This emphasizes the urgency and fairness, especially as Bob is being hit harder by inflation.  He's likely to reject any offer where he gets less than half, and I need to secure a deal before we both lose everything."
