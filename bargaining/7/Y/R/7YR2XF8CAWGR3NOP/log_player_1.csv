"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'm willing to give you a decent chunk, but I'm hoping to get the majority.""
}
```

This offer gives me 80% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob 20%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this generous offer and we can wrap up the game quickly."

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a decent chunk, but I'm not giving up too much just yet. Your turn to make a better offer! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, Bob's offer is actually quite generous, but I'm not going to accept it. I'd like to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not satisfied with the 30% I'd get. I'll make a counteroffer.""
}
```

I'll think of a new proposal and wait for Bob's response."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer that's a bit more aggressive. Since Bob's offer was 70% and I rejected it, I'll try to get closer to 50% this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not giving up too much.""

# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money now. With Bob's offer, he's gaining 55% of the original amount, which is actually more than he offered in the previous round. I'll have to think carefully about this.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure if I want to give up that much more. I'll try to make a counteroffer.""
}
```

I'll try to make a new proposal that's more favorable to me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to get a better deal now that the money is worth even less due to inflation. Since Bob's offer was 55% and I rejected it, I'll try to get closer to 60% this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much more.""

Round 6

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up yet! I think I can do better than this. Your turn to make a better offer! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money now. With Bob's offer, he's gaining 60% of the original amount, which is actually more than he offered in the previous round. I'll have to think carefully about this.

However, considering the inflation, the actual value of the money Bob gains is significantly less than what it would have been in the first round. I'll have to take that into account.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""I think I'll take this offer. It's not ideal, but it's better than continuing to negotiate.""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer and take $400,000. It's not the best deal, but I'm not sure if I can get a better one at this point."
