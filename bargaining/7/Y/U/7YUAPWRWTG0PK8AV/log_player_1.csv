"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

This means I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40."

# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, my valuation of the offer has changed.

I'll decide to reject this offer. The numbers are not in my favor.
