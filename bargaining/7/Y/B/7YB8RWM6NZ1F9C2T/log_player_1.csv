"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started with a fair split. You can try to do better in the next round if you want.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $700,000 and Bob gets $300,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm not giving away too much just yet. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation, the money I gain is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, so my effective gain would be $560,000.

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a decent improvement from my initial proposal, but I'd like to try to get a better deal. I'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth 80% of what it was in round 2, so my effective gain would be $448,000 (80% of $560,000).

Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the risk of inflation.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $550,000 and Bob gets $450,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway and offer a 50/50 split, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea to give away too much considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 48.8% inflation, the money I gain is worth 51.2% of what it was in the first round, so my effective gain would be $512,000 (51.2% of $1,000,000).

Considering Bob's offer, a 50/50 split seems reasonable, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. Since I've already rejected a few offers, I'll try to negotiate further. I'll reject this offer and see if Bob is willing to make a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 5, the money is worth 40.96% of what it was in the first round, so my effective gain would be $409,600 (40.96% of $1,000,000).

Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve more considering the risk I'm taking with inflation.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $540,000 and Bob gets $460,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting a bit desperate, but I'll give you a slightly better deal. This is my last offer before I start getting really worried about the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 67.23% inflation, the money I gain is worth 32.77% of what it was in the first round, so my effective gain would be $326,770 (32.77% of $1,000,000).

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about the split, but I'm getting desperate too. I think I've been too aggressive in my previous offers, and Bob is starting to get a better deal. I'll accept this offer to avoid getting even less in the next round.
