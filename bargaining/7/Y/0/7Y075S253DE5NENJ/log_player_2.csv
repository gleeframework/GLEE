Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I'll try to get a good share. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer. Since the money is still worth the same for me, but Alice's gain is worth 36% less, I'll try to take advantage of this. However, 40 is a decent offer, and I don't want to risk losing more. I'll accept this offer.
