"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you a decent amount, but I'm not going to give away too much.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $700,000 and Bob gets $300,000. I'm framing it as a fair split, but I'm not giving away too much, leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm going to flip the script this round. Fair is fair, but it's time you get a taste of your own medicine.  
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to turn the tables on me.

I'll think about it for a moment...

I'll reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think I'm ready to give up the majority of the money just yet. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle this time. A 50/50 split seems reasonable, considering the value of the money is decreasing.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair given the decreasing value of the money."
