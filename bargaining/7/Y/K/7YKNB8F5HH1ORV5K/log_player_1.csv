"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split, with me taking the larger share. I think this is a fair starting point, as I'm initiating the negotiation. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, I'm willing to accept Bob's offer.  It's a significant gain for me, and with the risk of further inflation, I don't want to gamble on a better deal."
