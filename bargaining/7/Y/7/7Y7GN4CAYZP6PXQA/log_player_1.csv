# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider the offer. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, I need to think about whether the 400,000 I'll get is worth it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about Bob's new offer, considering the increased inflation.

```
{
