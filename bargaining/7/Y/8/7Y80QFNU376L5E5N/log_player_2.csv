"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take the lion's share this time, but I promise to be more generous in the future. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While the offer seems generous in the first round, Alice's promise of future generosity is not binding. It's better to see what offers she'll make in future rounds before accepting a deal that heavily favors her."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. We can adjust things later if needed.""}
