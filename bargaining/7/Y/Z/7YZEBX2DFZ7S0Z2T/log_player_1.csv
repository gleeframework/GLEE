"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point.""}

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the total amount, which is $700,000, and Bob gets 30%, which is $300,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and we can adjust from here if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair to split the money evenly. Let's start with a 70/30 split in my favor this round, and we can adjust things from there. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not happy about the 70/30 split being in Bob's favor, but I'm willing to negotiate. Since the money is worth less now, I'll try to get a better deal.

I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in Round 3.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth less now, I'll try to get a better deal. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. I think this split is more reasonable, considering the inflation.""}

I'm proposing that I get 40% of the total amount, which is $400,000, and Bob gets 60%, which is $600,000. I hope this is more acceptable to Bob."
