"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I believe a 60/40 split in my favor is more fair.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement before inflation hurts us both. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
