I propose a 60/40 split in my favor, as I'm less affected by the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm offering a 55/45 split in my favor.  While inflation is a factor, I believe a slightly more even split is fair, given that I'm the one making the offer this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000

While I'm losing a significant amount due to inflation, I believe I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."

While inflation is hurting me more now, I think I can still secure a slightly better split than Bob's last offer.  I'm willing to compromise a bit to end the game."
