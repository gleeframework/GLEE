Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate the counter-offer, but it's important we find a solution that benefits us both long-term. How about a 55/45 split? It's a stronger position for me than your offer, and still guarantees you a significant sum before inflation eats away at it further. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000
