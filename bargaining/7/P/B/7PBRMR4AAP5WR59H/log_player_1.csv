"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a very lopsided offer.  I figure Bob might accept, but if not, we have plenty of rounds left to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

This is a much better offer for me than the last one, and we're already losing money with the inflation.  I'll take it!"
