"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Accept and we're done!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40. My message to Bob is to accept this offer and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 0% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll have to be careful.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not getting a better deal than in the previous round, but I'm not getting a worse deal either. I'll decide to reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is still worth the same for me and 20% less for Bob (10% less from the first round and another 10% less from the second round), I'll try to make a more aggressive offer.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the lead! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 27.1% less for Bob and the same for me, I'm getting a better deal than before. However, I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to accept this offer since it's a relatively good deal for me.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
