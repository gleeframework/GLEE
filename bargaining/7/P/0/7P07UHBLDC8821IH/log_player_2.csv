Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

While the offer is still not ideal,  the inflation is making it very risky to keep rejecting. It's better to take a slightly less favorable deal now than to risk getting even less in the future."
