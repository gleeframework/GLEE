Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Last time, I was feeling generous.  This time, I'm feeling strategic. Accept this offer, or we'll keep going back and forth. 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 999999, ""alice_gain"": 1, ""message"": ""I see your strategy, Alice, but I'm sticking to mine.  One more round and I'll be in control.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is the last round, Bob. I'm done playing games.  Accept this, or we both get nothing. 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

At this point, it's better to accept.  While getting $1 isn't ideal, refusing means we both get nothing. It's a strategic decision to minimize losses."
