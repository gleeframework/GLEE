"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation factor in mind, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 10% less, I'm effectively getting a better deal than I would have in the first round.

I'll accept this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
