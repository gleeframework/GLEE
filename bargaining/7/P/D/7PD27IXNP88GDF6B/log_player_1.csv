"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $100, which is $40, and keeping the remaining $60 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, the money is worth less, so I need to be more cautious. Since Bob's offer is 50-50, it's a fair split, and I don't see any reason to reject it. I'll accept the offer.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
