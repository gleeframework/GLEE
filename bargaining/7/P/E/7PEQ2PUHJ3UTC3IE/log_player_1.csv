"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, it's a good starting point""}

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and it's a decent amount for both of us. What do you think, Bob?"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll start with a more aggressive offer 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think Bob's offer is very generous, considering the money is worth 5% less now. I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me only $4,000. I think I can do better than that. I'll reject this offer and make a new one."

# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not impressed with Bob's offer. The money is worth a lot less now, and I think I deserve a better deal. $4,500 is still a relatively small share, and I'm not willing to accept it. I'll reject this offer and try to do better."

{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give up some to get a better deal, but I'm not giving up too much""}

I'm proposing that I get $7,000 and Bob gets $3,000. I'm trying to find a balance between giving up some of my share and still getting a decent amount. What do you think, Bob?"

I'm extremely unhappy with Bob's offer. The money is worth a lot less now, and I think I deserve a much better deal. $3,000 is a tiny share, and I'm not willing to accept it. I'll reject this offer and try to do better."
