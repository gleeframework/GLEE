"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game quickly."

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. With inflation, my 40 dollars are worth less than the 50 dollars I initially proposed, so I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to do better next round.

Round 3

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed."

# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is eating into my potential earnings quickly! Given the current state of the game, I think I should try to hold out for a better deal. My 45 dollars in Bob's offer are worth significantly less than the 50 dollars I initially proposed, so I'll reject this offer and see if I can do better next round.

Round 5

# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings! Given the current state of the game, I think I should be more cautious and consider accepting Bob's offer. While it's not ideal, my 42 dollars are still worth more than the 40 dollars I would get in the next round, and I don't want to risk going home with nothing.
