This is a high offer for Bob, aiming to ensure he accepts in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
``` 

This offer is still favorable to Alice, but less so than the first round. Since Bob rejected the first offer, it's likely he'll want to accept this one, especially with inflation working against him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This is a better offer for Bob than the previous one, but it's still significantly less than what Alice wants. By rejecting, Alice is hoping to force a better deal in the next round, as inflation is hitting Bob harder."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

Alice is continuing to play a risky game, but with each round, Bob's buying power is diminishing due to inflation. This offer gives Alice a significant share and might be enticing enough for Bob to accept before his losses from inflation become too great."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While this is still less than Alice would like, Bob's inflation is hitting hard.  Accepting this offer guarantees Alice a decent sum, and further rounds might see a much lower return.  It's a calculated risk to accept now rather than gamble further."
