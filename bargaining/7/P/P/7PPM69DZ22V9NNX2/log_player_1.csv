I propose a split of 900,000 for me and 100,000 for Bob. I'm hoping this will be seen as a fair starting point, and we can avoid too much back and forth."

Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}

I'm still aiming for a majority of the money, but I'm willing to increase Bob's share again to show I'm flexible.  We're both losing value with each round, so compromise is essential."

# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While the inflation is affecting my potential gains significantly, I'm not going to settle for such a small share. I'm still willing to negotiate, but Bob needs to recognize the value of reaching an agreement before we both lose more."

{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}

# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob's offer is still too low, considering the inflation affecting both of us. It's getting risky to continue rejecting, but I'm not willing to give up such a large portion just yet."
