"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly but slightly in my favor considering the inflation disadvantage I have. This way we both benefit. 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
I'm not comfortable with the 500 dollar difference, especially since the inflation will only increase the disparity in the future. I think I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4900,
""alice_gain"": 5100,
""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise on the split, but I need a little more than 4750 to make this worthwhile. Let's find a solution that benefits us both.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want a better deal, and I'm willing to compromise. This offer is between our previous ones and ensures we both get a decent amount with the inflation working against us. 
# Bob gain: 4850 
# Alice gain: 5150 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a more even split, I'm willing to accept this offer.  The inflation is becoming a serious factor, and I'd rather have something than risk getting nothing."
