Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a quick agreement.  Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a blatant power play, Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation. I'll counter with my own proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50} 
```

I'm going for a fair split this round.  We both get a decent amount, and it avoids the potential for endless back-and-forth.  Hopefully, Bob sees the logic in this."
