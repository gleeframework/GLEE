"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept this and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not a very generous offer from Bob!

Since the money is worth 20% less in this round, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 3000 / 0.8 = 3750
* Bob gain: 7000 / 0.8 = 8750

I'll reject this offer and try to do better next round. Here's my response:
