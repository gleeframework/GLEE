"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share, but you get a decent amount to start. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round. With a 20% decrease in value for me and only a 10% decrease for Alice, I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the next round. Alice's initial offer, although generous, doesn't account for the disproportionate impact of inflation on my share. I'm hoping to capitalize on this disparity to secure a more favorable split in subsequent rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 250000, ""alice_gain"": 750000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I believe this is a more balanced offer. Let's compromise before the money devalues further.""}\n\nI've taken into account the impact of inflation on both our shares and proposed a division that I believe better reflects the changing value of the money. By offering Alice a significant amount while securing a larger share for myself, I'm hoping to find a middle ground that she'll find acceptable, especially since the value of the money will continue to decrease in subsequent rounds."
