Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering we both have an equal chance of making the next offer. Let's be reasonable and end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
