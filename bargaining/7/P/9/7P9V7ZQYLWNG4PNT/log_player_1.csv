"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split of the $1,000,000. This way, we both get an equal share and the game can end here if Bob accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gain still worth the same as in the first round, I'll have to think carefully about Bob's offer.

Since the money I gain is worth the same, but Bob's gain is worth 10% less, I'm better off accepting this offer. I'll get 400,000 dollars, which is still a decent amount.
