"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'm willing to give you nothing, but you can make a better offer next round.""
}
```

This offer is a bit aggressive, but I'm hoping Bob will see it as a starting point and make a more reasonable offer in the next round."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm going for a fair deal - let's split it 90/10, with the majority going to me since I'm the one making the offer this time. It's a good deal for both of us, and we can get this game over quickly. 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to get a good deal, but I'm not sure I want to give him 90% of the money.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the 90/10 split. I'd like to keep negotiating.""

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you 40% of the money, but I think I deserve more. Let's see what you've got!""
}
```

Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still willing to negotiate, but I think it's time we got closer to a 70/30 split. It's a fair deal considering I'm the one making the offer this time, and it allows us both to get something before inflation eats away at our potential gains. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to get closer to his desired 70/30 split. I'm not sure I'm comfortable with giving him such a large portion of the money.

  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to give you 50% of the money, but I think we can do better than that. What do you say?""
