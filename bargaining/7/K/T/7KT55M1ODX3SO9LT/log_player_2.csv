"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Alice, I'll offer a slightly lower amount to Alice to account for her discount.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","It's a 50-50 split, but considering the inflation, it's actually a better deal for me since my gain is worth less than Alice's gain due to the 19% discount. I'll accept this offer.
