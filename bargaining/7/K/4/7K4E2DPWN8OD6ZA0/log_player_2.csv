"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I take a bit more since the value decreases for both of us as time goes on. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
It's too early to accept this offer. I want to see what Alice is willing to offer later, especially since the money will be worth less to me in the future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split the money evenly. I'm willing to go with a fair offer to start off.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's meet in the middle. This is a slight improvement for me, considering the time pressure. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I'd prefer a more even split, accepting this offer is the best course of action given the time pressure and the fact that my share is worth less with each round."
