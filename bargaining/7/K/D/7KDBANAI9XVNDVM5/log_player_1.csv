I'm going to start with a generous offer, hoping to get this over with quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to reject this offer. While it's better than what Bob offered me in the first round, it's still far from fair. I'm confident I can get a better deal, especially considering the inflation factor."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15} 
```

I'm going to stick with a fairly high percentage for myself, but I'm going to reduce my initial offer a bit, hoping to find a middle ground. The inflation is starting to bite, so I need to be more realistic about my chances."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm going to accept this offer. While it's still not ideal, it's clear that Bob is becoming more stubborn, and with the inflation continuing, I'm not sure I can get a better deal. I'd rather take the 75% now and avoid risking getting nothing at all."
