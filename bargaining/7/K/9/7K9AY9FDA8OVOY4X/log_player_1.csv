"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept this and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but still a decent offer. Consider this! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is starting to bite!

After considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that a 40-60 split is fair, especially considering the inflation is affecting me more harshly than Bob. I'd like to negotiate further to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share. This is my revised offer.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still aiming to get a bit more than Bob's previous offer. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, considering the inflation is affecting me more. Let's see if this is acceptable. 
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on me now!

After considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm willing to accept this offer, as the difference between the amounts is relatively small, and I'm not sure if I can get a better deal in the next round. The inflation is making it harder for me to get a good share, so I'll take this one!"
