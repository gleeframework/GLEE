"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start""
}
```

This is a straightforward proposal, where we both get an equal share of $5,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering I'm taking the risk of rejection in this round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not affected by inflation, but Bob's gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.

I'm not sure if a 60/40 split is fair, considering I took the risk of rejection in the first round as well. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not a good trade for me, I'll make a counteroffer""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, a 55/45 split is more appealing""
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise that's closer to a 50/50 split, but with a slight bias towards me. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
