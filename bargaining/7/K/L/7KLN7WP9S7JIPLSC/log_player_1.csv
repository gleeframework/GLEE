Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's split it 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is getting less valuable by the round, so I need to think strategically.

Since Bob's offer is to split the money evenly, that means I'll get $500,000 and Bob will get $500,000. However, considering the inflation, Bob's gain is worth 20% less than my gain. This means that in terms of purchasing power, I'm still getting a better deal.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better deal for myself.
