It's better to reject this offer. You have 12 rounds, and inflation is going to hurt Alice more than it hurts you. You can likely get a better deal later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}
``` 
Let's flip the script. This offer gives Alice a smaller share, but she still gets something.  With inflation, we'll both get more in the long run."
