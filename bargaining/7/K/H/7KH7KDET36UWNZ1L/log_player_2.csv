"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the bigger share this round, but you'll get more in the long run if we keep playing. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While it's tempting to accept a quick 100,000, it's a very small share. By rejecting, I can force Alice to make a better offer in the next round, as the money will be worth less to her."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
