I'm going to start with a very small offer to Bob.  This is to see if he's willing to accept a tiny amount to get something, or if he'll play the long game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much better than the tiny amount he was offered in the first round.  However, given the inflation, I believe I can still get a better deal by holding out for a few more rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm increasing my offer to Bob, but still keeping a larger share for myself. I'm hoping to incentivize him to accept, but I'm also aware of the inflation and want to ensure I get a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to what I want, but I still think I can get a slightly better deal by playing it a little longer. The inflation is hurting Bob more than me at this point."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}
```

I'm again increasing my offer to Bob, but still keeping a larger share for myself. I'm aiming for a compromise while leveraging the inflation effect."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a fair offer considering the inflation.  It's a 50/50 split, and while I could continue playing, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer."
