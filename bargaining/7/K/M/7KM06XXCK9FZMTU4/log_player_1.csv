# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to take advantage of me. I'll have to think carefully about this one. Considering the inflation, I'd rather not accept an offer that gives me only 20% of the original amount. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.
