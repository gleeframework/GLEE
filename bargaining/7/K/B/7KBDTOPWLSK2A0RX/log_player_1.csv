"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

This way, I'll get 80% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob will get 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is still worth 100% of its original value, I'll consider the offer carefully. However, I'm not satisfied with the split, as it's equal, and I was hoping for a better share. I'll reject the offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since I rejected the previous offer, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Considering the inflation and the fact that the money I gain is still worth 100%, I'll make a new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

This way, I'll get 70% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob will get 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me calculate the value of Bob's gain in the first round, considering the 27.1% inflation. If the original value of Bob's gain was $200,000, then after 3 rounds of inflation, it would be worth:

$200,000 * (1 - 0.1) * (1 - 0.271) = $200,000 * 0.9 * 0.7289 â‰ˆ $130,578

Now, considering the offer, Bob's gain is $400,000, which is equivalent to approximately $130,578 in the first round's value. I'll accept the offer.
