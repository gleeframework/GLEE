"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. This is a 60/40 split, giving you a good share, but also recognizing my need to get a larger piece to make up for the potential inflation. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
