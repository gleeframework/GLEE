"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this offer and we can both walk away with a nice sum. Let's not risk it getting worse.""
}
```

This way, I get 80% of the initial amount, and Bob gets 20%. I'm hoping Bob will see the wisdom in accepting this offer and we can both walk away with a good chunk of money!"
