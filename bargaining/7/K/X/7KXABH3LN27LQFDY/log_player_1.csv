"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose taking $9,000 for myself and leaving $1,000 for Bob.  It's a big offer in the first round, so I hope he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I accept.  While it's less than my initial proposal, I'm not sure I can get a better deal in the next round considering inflation."
