"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I propose to take 90$ and let Bob have 10$. This is a fairly generous offer in my opinion and should encourage him to accept it, ending the game in our favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
This is a fair offer and I'm not sure I'd be able to get a better deal in future rounds due to the inflation."
