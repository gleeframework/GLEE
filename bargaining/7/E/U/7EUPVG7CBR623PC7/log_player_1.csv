"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a better deal this round, but be warned, I'm not getting any softer on the next rounds! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is trying to squeeze me in the second round!

I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can do better than a 40/60 split. I'll wait for the next round to make my next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 40/60, I'll try to get a better deal this round. I'll aim for a 45/55 split, which is a bit more favorable to me.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""You said you'd give me a better deal this round, but I think I can do better next time if I don't accept this one""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not taking the hint, are you? I'll give you a slightly better deal, but don't expect it to get any better from here! 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob is really trying to squeeze me now!

I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because it's still a 35/65 split, which is not favorable to me. I'm hoping that Bob will make a more generous offer in the next round, considering the inflation is eating away at the value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 35/65, I'll try to get a better deal this round. I'll aim for a 42/58 split, which is a bit more favorable to me.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not getting any softer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway""
}
```"
