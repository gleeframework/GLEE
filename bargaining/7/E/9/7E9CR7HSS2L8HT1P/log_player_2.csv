"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: My patience wears thin, take this or wait 
# Bob gain: 42

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You should've taken the previous one, now it's less 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage.  While the offer is getting worse, accepting a 40/60 split at this stage would set a very bad precedent for future rounds. I believe I still have leverage to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both benefit.""}"

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your 50/50 was a good try, but I'm not budging 
# Bob gain: 38 
# Alice gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**  Alice is playing a tough game, but she's unwilling to accept a fair deal. While the inflation is hurting, I need to show resolve. Accepting 38/62 would be significantly worse than my previous offers. I'm hoping she starts to feel the pressure of the shrinking pot."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""This is getting ridiculous, Alice. I'm offering a compromise - take it before inflation eats away at both our potential gains.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, Bob. This is the best you'll get 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** This is getting dangerous, but Alice is clearly trying to bully me into a terrible deal.  I'm banking on her cracking under the pressure of the remaining rounds. A 35/65 split is simply too large a difference to accept, especially knowing my bargaining position will only get worse with each rejection."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""Alice, we're down to the wire. This offer is a last-ditch effort to salvage something. Don't be greedy - let's both walk away with something.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 10.

Round 11
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.13% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Last chance, Bob. I'm not backing down 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  It's agonizing, but I have to cut my losses. Accepting a 30/70 split is awful, but with only one round left, and the inflation eating further into my potential gains, it's the best I can hope for. If I reject this, I risk walking away with nothing."
