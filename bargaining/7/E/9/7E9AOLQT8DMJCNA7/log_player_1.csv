"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the initial $100, which is $70, and you get 30%, which is $30."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a slightly more even split is fairer, Alice.  Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 5% inflation, the money is worth less, so I'll consider the new values.

I'll accept Bob's offer for this round. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
