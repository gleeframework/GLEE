Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's stop wasting time. This is a fair deal - take it or leave it. The clock is ticking. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is pressuring for a quick decision, time is working in Alice's favor.  The longer the game goes on, the less appealing Bob's offers will seem due to the rapid inflation affecting his potential gains.  Alice is better off holding out for a better deal."

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  Accept this offer and let's end this charade.  My patience is wearing thin. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly getting frustrated, but that works to Alice's advantage. While his message sounds threatening, he has no leverage as he loses more with each passing round. Alice's offer was already a compromise, and Bob's counter-offer is still heavily skewed in his favor. Holding firm and letting inflation chip away at Bob's potential gains is the best strategy for Alice."
