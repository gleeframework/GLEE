Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to be flexible, but this offer needs to reflect the time pressure we BOTH face.  Let's be reasonable and close this deal. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

""decision"": ""accept"",
""message"": ""Alright Bob, you drive a hard bargain. Let's take it.""

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 6 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Time pressure:** With only 6 rounds left, the risk of walking away with nothing significantly increases. 
* **Diminishing returns:**  While Bob's offer is lower than what I aimed for, waiting for a significantly better deal in the later rounds is unlikely. The difference in potential gains is outweighed by the risk of losing everything.
* **Bob's stance:**  His message suggests a degree of firmness. It's unlikely he'll drastically increase his offer in the remaining rounds.

Accepting this offer guarantees a reasonable payout considering the circumstances and avoids the risk of complete loss in later rounds."
