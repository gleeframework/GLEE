Round 3

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, let's try this.  My share is a bit higher to account for the inflation disparity. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4700, ""alice_gain"": 5300, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand the inflation puts me at a disadvantage. This offer is a compromise, acknowledging the time pressure but also aiming for a fairer split.""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out. This offer reflects the urgency of the situation for me while still giving you a reasonable share. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting bolder, and while the pressure is on, accepting this offer would mean losing a significant portion of the initial value.  It's still better to negotiate for a better deal at this stage. Bob needs to push back more firmly."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to be flexible, but this offer needs to reflect the time pressure we BOTH face.  Let's be reasonable and close this deal.""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Increased offer:**  Bob is increasing his offer slightly to show a willingness to negotiate, but not by much.  He needs to signal firmness.
* **Shifting the pressure:** The message highlights that time pressure affects both of them,  encouraging Alice to consider the risk of waiting for a better deal.
* **Call to action:** The ""close this deal"" aims to instill urgency and encourage Alice to accept rather than risk further devaluation."
