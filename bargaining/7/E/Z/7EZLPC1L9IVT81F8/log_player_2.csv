Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is stubbornly sticking close to her initial offer, even though the value of the money is decreasing significantly. By continuing to reject her offers, I increase the pressure on her to make a more substantial concession.  There's still time, but each round makes getting a better deal riskier."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Okay Alice, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and we both lose if this keeps going.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

The decreasing value of the money makes each round increasingly risky.  A 50/50 split is fair, and pushing Alice further could backfire. It's time to prioritize securing a deal over maximizing potential gain."
