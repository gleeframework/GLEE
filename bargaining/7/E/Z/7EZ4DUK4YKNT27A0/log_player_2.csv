Alice's offer:

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than a 60/40 split. I'm offering 55/45, which is still a fair deal, but gives us both a slightly larger share. We have time to negotiate further, but the inflation is going to eat away at the value of our money with each passing round.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to compromise. How about 58/42? It's closer to the middle ground and gives us both a decent share before inflation eats away too much more. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58
