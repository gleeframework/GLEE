"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and let's seal the deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can finalize the deal quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle and be done with it! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer... Splitting it down the middle seems reasonable, but I'm not sure if I'm getting the better deal.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 640000,
  ""bob_gain"": 360000,
  ""message"": ""A more modest proposal, but I think it's fair.""
}
```

I'm trying to make a more balanced offer, but still trying to get a slightly better deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation has taken a bigger hit, and my gain is now worth 51.2% of what it was in the first round (100% * 0.848 * 0.768).

I'm not thrilled about the fact that Bob's gain is still larger than mine, but I'm not sure if I can do better. I'll have to think carefully about this offer...
