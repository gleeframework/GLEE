I'm still holding out for a better deal. I think I can get more than 43 dollars!"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're running out of time, let's split it almost evenly 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though it's a bit less than I hoped for, it's getting risky to keep rejecting.  We're running out of time, and accepting this means at least I get something."
