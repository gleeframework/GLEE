"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."

# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the offer on the table, I'll decide to reject it. My initial offer was $800,000, and Bob's offer is only $500,000. I'm hoping to do better than that.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share, hoping he'll accept this time."
