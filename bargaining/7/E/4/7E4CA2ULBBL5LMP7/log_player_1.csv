I'm going to start with a pretty uneven split.  I'm hoping Bob will accept it, but if not, I'm confident I can get a good deal in the next round.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While I'm sure he's feeling confident after the last round, I'm going to fight for a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm proposing a more balanced split this time.  The inflation has made the money worth less, so I'm willing to compromise a bit more.  I think this is a fair offer, and hopefully Bob will see it that way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Okay, this is getting risky. Inflation is hitting hard, and while I'd prefer a more even split, I don't think I can do much better.  I'm accepting Bob's offer."
