"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5}
```

I'm going to start with a slightly unfair offer, keeping 95 dollars for myself. This is to try and secure a quick agreement, and I'm banking on Bob not knowing about the inflation. If he rejects, I'll have to adjust my strategy in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation rate is impacting the value of the money significantly. Accepting this offer ensures I get something, and the decrease in value is still less than if I were to reject and risk getting nothing in the next round."
