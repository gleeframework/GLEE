"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable""}\n\n###\n\nBob, I'm offering you a fair deal. I'll take 60% of the money, and you'll get 40%. This way, we both get a significant amount, and we can avoid the hassle of going through multiple rounds. Plus, think about the inflation - the sooner we agree, the more the money is worth! Let's be reasonable and settle this in the first round. What do you say, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm confident we can find a more equitable split. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not going to settle for 40% of the money, especially since I started by offering Bob a generous 40% in the first round. I'm willing to negotiate, but I think I can get a better deal. Let's see what the next round brings!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\n###\n\nBob, I see you're a tough negotiator! I respect that. In the spirit of compromise, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. Let's split the money 55-45 in my favor. This way, we both get a decent share, and we can put this game behind us. The inflation is starting to bite, so let's not drag this out any further! What do you say, Bob?"
