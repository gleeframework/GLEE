I'm going to start with a proposal that gives me a large share, since I know Bob's money will not be losing value with each round.  I'm hoping this will be enough to convince him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'll reject this offer.  Although Bob's offer is worse for me in terms of the raw amount of money, I'm still gaining something.  The inflation is hurting my side, but I can still make a better offer to Bob in the next round and potentially get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
``` 

I'm going to offer Bob a slightly higher share than in the previous round, hoping to incentivize him to accept.  The inflation is definitely a factor, and I need to find a balance between getting a decent share and ending the game before the value of my share decreases further."
