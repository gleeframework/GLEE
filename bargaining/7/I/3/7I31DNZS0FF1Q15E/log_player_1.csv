Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want a larger share, but my turn now.  I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. This ensures we both benefit before inflation diminishes the value. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
