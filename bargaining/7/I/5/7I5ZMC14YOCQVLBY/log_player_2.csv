"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 300000

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'd like to propose a more even split.  We both benefit, and we don't have to risk the money shrinking further.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, that last offer was too risky for me. This is my final offer - let's close the deal and avoid further losses to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a more even split, the inflation rate means that accepting this offer is the best way to maximize my gains.  Further rounds increase the risk of losing even more money due to inflation."
