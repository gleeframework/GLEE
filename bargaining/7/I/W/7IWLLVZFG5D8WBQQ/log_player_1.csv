"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 0% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll consider the proposal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to make a counteroffer, as I think I can do better than 40% of the remaining value."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","In round 3, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 10% less for Bob now (5% less from round 1 and 5% less from round 2), I'll aim for a slightly higher percentage for myself:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 62 
# Bob gain: 38 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 0% less for me and 14.26% less for Bob, I'll consider the proposal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I still think I can do better than 38% of the remaining value. I'll wait for Bob's next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","In round 5, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 19.62% less for Bob now (5% less from round 1, 5% less from round 2, and 9.62% less from round 4), I'll aim for an even higher percentage for myself:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
