Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your fairness, but I believe a more even split is possible.  Let's both take a bit more from the pot. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. The value is dropping quickly for both of us, so a fair split is the best way to ensure we both get something. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

Even with the inflation, accepting a 50/50 split right now is not in Alice's best interest. Bob is hurting more from the inflation and will become more desperate in the coming rounds. Alice can likely secure a better deal by continuing to negotiate."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, the value is plummeting.  We need to compromise to get anything at all. Let's both take a little less and secure a reasonable share. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is right about the decreasing value, he's hurting more than Alice.  Alice can afford to be a bit more patient and wait for Bob to make a more desperate offer. The current offer is better than Bob's previous one, but it's still likely Alice can get more."

""alice_gain"": 7200,

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, the money is almost worthless.  We need to agree on something now. This is my final offer - let's split the remaining value fairly. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a crucial point in the game. While Bob's offer isn't ideal, several factors suggest accepting:

* **Time Pressure:** Only 4 rounds remain. The risk of getting nothing significantly increases if the game continues.
* **Bob's Desperation:**  His language (""final offer,"" ""almost worthless"") suggests he's feeling the pressure of the decreasing value and is willing to settle.
* **Diminishing Returns:** While Alice might secure a slightly better deal in the next round or two, the difference won't be significant compared to the risk of losing everything.

Taking the 60/40 split now guarantees Alice a reasonable share, even considering inflation.  Waiting further carries a significant risk with potentially minimal reward."
