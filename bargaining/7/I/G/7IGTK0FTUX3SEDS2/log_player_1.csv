"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my initial offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```
This is a relatively fair split, with me getting 60% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob getting 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The offer is a 50-50 split, which is a reasonable compromise. I accept this offer.
