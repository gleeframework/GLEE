This offer gives me a larger share, but it's still fair since Bob gets a significant amount as well. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob is being greedy, and I know the money is worth less for him with every round. I'll counter with a better offer for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

I'm increasing my share slightly while still offering Bob a decent portion.  This should incentivize him to accept, as the money will be worth even less for him in the next round."
