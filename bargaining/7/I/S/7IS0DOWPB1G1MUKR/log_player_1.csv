I'm going to start with a relatively fair offer, but still heavily favoring myself since I know I can potentially get more as the rounds go on. Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being greedy! I'll reject this offer and see if he'll come down in the next round. The inflation is working in my favor, and I can afford to be patient."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20} 
```

I'm going to offer Bob a bit more this time, but still keeping the majority of the money for myself. He's clearly feeling the inflation, and I'm hoping he'll accept before things get worse for him."
