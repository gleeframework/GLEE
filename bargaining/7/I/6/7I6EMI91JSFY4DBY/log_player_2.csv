Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Alice, the total amount is now 9,000$ for me and 9,500$ for Alice.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is now worth 19% less for me and 9.75% less for Alice, I need to consider the actual amounts.

For me, 4000$ is equivalent to 3200$ in the first round.
For Alice, 6000$ is equivalent to 6750$ in the first round.

This offer is not as favorable for me as my previous offer, so I'll reject it.
