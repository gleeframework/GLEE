"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting 60 dollars and Bob getting 40 dollars. I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but still a fair split! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 20% less, so I'll get $48 instead of $60.

I don't think Bob's offer is very generous, considering I'm the one who made the first proposal. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time, given that Bob's previous offer was quite lopsided.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Time to meet in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which should be more to Bob's liking, considering his previous offer."
