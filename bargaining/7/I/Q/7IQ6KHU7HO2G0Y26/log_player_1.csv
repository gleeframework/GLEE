I'm starting with a generous offer, hoping to secure a quick win.  I'll keep an eye on the inflation, but it's still early in the game.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I would have preferred a higher share, the inflation is a significant factor.  It's better to take a smaller gain now than risk losing even more in the next round."
