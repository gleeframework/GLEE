"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a pretty aggressive offer, giving Bob a tiny portion. I'm hoping he'll be tempted to accept it quickly, as he gets something rather than nothing if the rounds run out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
 
This is a classic example of the ultimatum game.  It seems obvious that Bob is being extremely unfair, but the game highlights how even a tiny amount can be enough to sway someone to accept a deal, especially if they are afraid of getting nothing. I will reject his offer and see if he will be more reasonable in future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to try a more balanced approach this time, offering Bob a more significant share.  I believe this could be a good compromise.  While I'm still aiming for the majority, I'm showing a willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

This is starting to feel like a stalemate. While it's tempting to accept this offer due to the risk of getting nothing, it's still significantly unfair. I'm going to reject it and see if Bob will finally offer a more reasonable deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm going for a 50/50 split this round. I've shown flexibility by lowering my initial demands and now I'm offering a truly fair deal.  I believe this is the most reasonable way to reach an agreement and avoid the risk of both of us getting nothing."
