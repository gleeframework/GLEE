"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

This way, I'll get 80% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob will get 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my share is worth 20% less, so I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a new offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This time, I'll give Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still aiming to get the majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings.

I'll calculate the value of my share in the first round, which was $800,000, and apply the 48.8% reduction: $800,000 * 0.5162 = $412,560.

Considering this, Bob's offer is actually quite reasonable. I'll accept it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
