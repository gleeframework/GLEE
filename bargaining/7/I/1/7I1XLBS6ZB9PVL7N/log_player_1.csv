"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
```

I propose keeping 999,000 for myself and giving Bob 1,000. This seems like a fair starting point, as it offers Bob a small amount while ensuring the majority of the money goes to me. I'll see if he accepts, and if not, we can adjust the offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly better for him than my initial proposal. However, I am confident that I can secure a better deal for myself.  It is worth taking the risk of moving to the next round, where I can make a counter-proposal, potentially  achieving a more favorable outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000} 
```

I propose a split of 800,000 for me and 200,000 for Bob. This offer is less generous than Bob's previous offer, but I believe it is still reasonable. Considering the inflation factor, we both get a considerable sum. I am hopeful Bob will accept this proposal and we can end this game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still better for him than my previous offer, but it's not a good deal for me.  The inflation is affecting my share significantly. I will continue to negotiate and try to secure a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I propose a split of 600,000 for me and 400,000 for Bob. This offer is closer to Bob's previous offer but still favors me.  I am aware of the escalating inflation, so this proposal represents a compromise while still allowing me to secure a substantial share.  Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is not ideal, but it's the best I'm likely to get at this point. The inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money I'm earning, and continuing to reject offers will likely result in a much smaller share for me in the end. Accepting Bob's offer will secure at least some money."
