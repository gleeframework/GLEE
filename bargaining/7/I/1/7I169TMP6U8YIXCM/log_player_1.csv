"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a split of $900,000 for me and $100,000 for Bob.  I'm hoping to secure a large portion of the money in this first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'm not getting the majority of the money, it's better than nothing.  With the inflation, the value of my potential gains will continue to shrink if I reject.  It's time to take what I can get."
