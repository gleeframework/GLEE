Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm not buying it 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit my diminishing returns due to inflation. I need to hold firm and hope she starts proposing more reasonable offers as the rounds progress.  While my gains are decreasing, getting a smaller share is still better than nothing, which is what we both get if we reach round 12 without an agreement."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting closer, but I can wait 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough one, and the pressure is on with the remaining rounds dwindling. However, Alice's tone suggests she's confident in running the clock down.  I need to show some strength and hope she panics in the later rounds. Accepting 44 now sets a dangerous precedent."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 46, ""alice_gain"": 54, ""message"": ""This is reasonable.  Don't get greedy.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take a little more, thanks 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The end game is here. If I reject this, there are only three rounds left, and Alice is very likely to push for even less in the remaining rounds. Accepting 45 now, even with the significant inflation, is better than risking getting nothing or a much smaller amount in the final rounds."
