"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and consider the inflation!""}\n\nI'm offering Bob 40 dollars and keeping 60 dollars for myself, considering that with each passing round, the value of money decreases more for me than for Bob. This way, we both get a significant amount, and it's a relatively fair starting point for negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a fair share, but we need to factor in the inflation. Let's work together! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, although he's trying to factor in inflation, the difference in how inflation affects us isn't fully accounted for in his proposal. Given that the money is worth 20% less for me but only 10% less for Bob in this round, I believe I can negotiate for a better share in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation difference, let's adjust accordingly.""}\n\nGiven the increasing impact of inflation on my share, I'm adjusting my offer to ensure I still get a significant portion while being fair to Bob. This proposal reflects the different rates at which our shares are devalued."
