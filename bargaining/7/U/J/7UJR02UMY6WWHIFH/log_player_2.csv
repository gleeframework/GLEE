I'm Bob, and this offer is way too low. I'll try to get a better deal in the next round."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000}
``` 
I propose a much fairer split: 900,000 for me and 100,000 for Alice. This ensures we both get a significant share of the money."

# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While this is a better offer than her first one, I'm still not satisfied. I'll try to negotiate a more favorable deal in the next round."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a significant improvement from the previous round, and I believe it's a fair compromise given the inflation affecting Alice's share."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This offer is starting to look more reasonable. While I'd prefer more, accepting this split ensures I get a good share and we don't risk losing everything due to further inflation."
