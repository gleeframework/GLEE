"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

Let's see if Bob is willing to accept a small cut to get something right away!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm not going to accept such a low offer!  I'm hoping Bob will realize that we need to negotiate a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
``` 

This time I'm going to offer a much larger share to Bob, but still maintaining a decent amount for myself. The inflation is starting to get serious, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still not happy with this offer.  Even though the money is worth less, I can hold out for a better deal. Bob needs to understand that we both have something to lose if we keep rejecting each other's offers."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
``` 

I'm proposing a more balanced split this time. I'm aware that inflation is biting, but I'm confident that we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. Let's see if Bob is ready to be more reasonable."
