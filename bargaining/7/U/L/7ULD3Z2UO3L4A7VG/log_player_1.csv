"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\n###\n\nI am offering 600,000 dollars for myself and 400,000 dollars for Bob. This is a reasonable offer considering the progressive decrease in value due to inflation. It's in both our interests to conclude the game as quickly as possible to minimize loss. I am hoping Bob will see the logic in accepting this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the inflation we have to account for. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI will reject this offer because, although the value of money decreases with each round, accepting 400,000 dollars now (which is actually worth less due to inflation) seems less favorable compared to potentially getting a better offer in the next round or making a counteroffer that could be more beneficial. The difference in inflation impact between us (20% for me vs. 5% for Bob) means that prolonging the game disadvantages me more, but I'm willing to take that risk for a potentially better outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, this is the best I can do""}\n\n###\n\nGiven the progressive devaluation of the money and the fact that we both lose value with each passing round, I'm making a slightly more conservative offer compared to the first round, aiming to find a middle ground that Bob might find acceptable. This offer still leans in my favor but acknowledges the urgency of concluding the game to minimize further loss. I'm hoping Bob will see the reason in this offer and accept it to end the game."
