Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to pressure me with the ""final offer"" tactic.  While the decreasing value due to inflation is a concern, accepting a deal heavily in her favor isn't the solution. I need to hold firm and push for a more equitable split, even if it means going down to the wire."
