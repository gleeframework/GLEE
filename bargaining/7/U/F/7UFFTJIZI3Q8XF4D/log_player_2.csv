"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, Bob. 60-40 seems reasonable. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
Let's see if we can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I appreciate your fairness, Alice, but I think we can do better for both of us.  I'd propose a 60/40 split in my favor, as the value of the money is declining for me.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob. 55-45 seems like a fair split, considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll take it.  It's not ideal, but with the inflation, it's better than risking getting nothing at all."
