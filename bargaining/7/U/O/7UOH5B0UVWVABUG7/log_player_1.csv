Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer was a bit too skewed for my liking. I understand the time pressure, so I'm offering you a reasonable deal with a slight advantage for me considering the inflation disparity. Let's close this out. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
