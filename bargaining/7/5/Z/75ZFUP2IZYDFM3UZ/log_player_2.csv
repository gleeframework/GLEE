Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better deal than that.  Let's find a middle ground, or this will keep going back and forth. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting this offer begins to make more sense in light of the rapid inflation. 

* **Declining Value:**  The longer this goes on, the less the money is worth. Another rejection means risking even less in the next round.
* **Alice's Position:** Alice seems firm on getting a larger share. It's unlikely she'll agree to anything dramatically better for Bob.
* **Certainty vs. Risk:** Accepting now provides a guaranteed amount. Rejecting and countering carries the risk of Alice further lowering her offer. 

It's a tough choice, but sometimes getting something is better than risking getting nothing as inflation eats away at the potential gains."
