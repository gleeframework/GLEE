Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better.  I'm willing to split it 60/40, with me getting the bigger share. Since the money is worth less each round, I think it's in our best interest to reach an agreement now. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
