Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable.  My offer in Round 1 was more than fair. I understand you want a good deal, but this is getting ridiculous.  I'm willing to take a little less to end this now, but I won't accept anything less than $55. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
