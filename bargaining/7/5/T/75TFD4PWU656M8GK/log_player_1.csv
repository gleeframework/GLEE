"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives Alice 90% of the money and Bob 10%.  It's a fairly aggressive offer, but it's a good starting point to see what Bob will accept. I'm hoping to secure a good portion of the money early on before the inflation effects kick in."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best strategy for me at this point. The inflation is significant, and while the offer isn't ideal, it's better than potentially getting nothing in later rounds."
