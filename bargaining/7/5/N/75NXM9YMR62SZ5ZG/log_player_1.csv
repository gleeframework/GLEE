I'll take the lion's share, but leave a little something for Bob.  He'll need to agree quickly, though, before the inflation kicks in!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's better to take half now than risk getting even less in the next round."
