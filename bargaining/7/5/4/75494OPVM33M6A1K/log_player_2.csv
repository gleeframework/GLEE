"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the majority, but you get a good chunk to start. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While it's tempting to take the $1000, it's better to see if Alice is willing to offer more. There are still 11 rounds, and the money will depreciate for Bob with each round. It's worth seeing if a better deal is possible."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000, ""message"": ""I think this is a fair starting point, considering the money is going to depreciate for me each round. Let's start a negotiation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to give up some of my share, but I need a good amount to make it worth my while. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While this offer is better than the previous one,  it's still not great considering the inflation affecting Bob's gains.  It's worth seeing if Alice is willing to come up to a closer compromise."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 3500, ""alice_gain"": 6500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway. This offer is closer to your last proposal but keeps things fair for both of us. Let's reach an agreement.""}
```"
