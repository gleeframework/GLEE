"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount, but it's a fair starting point. I'm keeping $900,000 for myself, which is a significant portion of the total amount. The message is a friendly one, hoping to persuade Bob to accept the offer and end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair.  50/50 split seems like a reasonable starting point. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants a 50/50 split, which is a reasonable proposal. Since the money is worth the same for me as it was in the first round, I'm not gaining any advantage by rejecting this offer. I'll accept the 50/50 split.
