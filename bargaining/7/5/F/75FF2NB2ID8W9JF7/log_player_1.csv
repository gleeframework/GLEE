"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself, with the message ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you say?"""
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a bit more, but not too greedy. Your turn! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less, I'll adjust my gain accordingly. I'll calculate the actual amount I'd get if I accepted Bob's offer:

$8,000 is 80% of the original $10,000, so I'd get 20% of the original amount. Let's calculate the actual amount:

$10,000 x 0.2 = $2,000

But, since the money is worth 10% less, the actual amount I'd get is:

$2,000 x 0.9 = $1,800

However, according to Bob's offer, I'd get $2,000. I'd actually get more than the adjusted amount, so I'll accept the offer.
