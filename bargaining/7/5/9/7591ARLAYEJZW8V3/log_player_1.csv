Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit too much in your favor, Alice. How about a 55/45 split? It's still a slight advantage for me, but closer to even.  Let's settle this before inflation eats into our potential winnings. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
