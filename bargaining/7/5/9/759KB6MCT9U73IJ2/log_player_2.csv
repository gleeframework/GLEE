{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is fairer, considering the inflation factor. It gives you a decent amount and I get a little more for taking the risk of going to the next round.""}

# Alice's message: Bob, this is a serious offer. I need to get a decent share due to inflation, but I'm willing to be slightly more generous than your last proposal. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800
