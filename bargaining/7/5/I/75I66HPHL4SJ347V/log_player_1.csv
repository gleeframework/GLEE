"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Split it down the middle, let's get started!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. Let's get this game going!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, but I'll take a slightly larger share this time! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth 10% less now, the actual amounts I'd gain are:

* Alice gain: 5000 / 0.9 = 5555.56
* Bob gain: 5000 / 0.9 = 5555.56

Considering the inflation, I think this offer is a good one, and meeting in the middle seems like a fair compromise. I'll accept Bob's offer.
