I propose to keep $9,000 and give Bob $1,000.  This seems like a fair starting point, but I'm open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}

I'm willing to give Bob a little more this time, but I need to make sure I get a good share. Let's try $8,000 for me and $2,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500

This is a tough call, but I'm holding out for a better deal.  The inflation is really hurting me, but I think I can still get more than $4,500."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000} 
``` 

I'm going to try to compromise. $7,000 for me and $3,000 for Bob seems like a fair offer, given the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While this offer is far less than I wanted, the inflation is starting to take a real toll. Accepting is the best option to avoid getting nothing."
