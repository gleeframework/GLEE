Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a fairly generous offer.  I figure Bob might be willing to accept it, especially since we don't know what the inflation impact is on him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'm getting less than my original offer, it's still a significant amount of money, and it's unclear how Bob's inflation is affecting him. It's possible he's being impacted even more severely, so I'll take the 50/50 split."
