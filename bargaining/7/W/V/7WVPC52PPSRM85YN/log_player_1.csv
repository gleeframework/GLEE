"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the fair start, Alice, but I think I can do better.  Let's see if you agree with this! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to flip the script!

I'll think for a moment... Ah, I'm not going to fall for it that easily!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer and wait for the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Time to make a counteroffer!

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You tried to flip the script, Bob, but I'm not falling for it. Let's try again!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which is a bit more in my favor this time. Your turn, Bob!"
