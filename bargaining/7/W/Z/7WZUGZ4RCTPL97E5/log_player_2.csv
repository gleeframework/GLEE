"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money reasonably.  I think this is a fair offer considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is ""fair"" in the sense of being close to a 50/50 split, it's not in my best interest given the inflation.  I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think this is a fairer split given the inflation.  Let's move forward.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer. We both lose if we don't agree. I am being fair considering the inflation impacts me more. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is significantly impacting both of us, and it's better to secure some gains than risk getting nothing."
