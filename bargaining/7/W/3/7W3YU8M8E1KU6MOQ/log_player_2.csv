# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my offer is quite generous 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""The value is decreasing rapidly.  This is my final offer.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Last chance, the inflation is killing your share 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While not ideal, the value of waiting any longer is significantly diminished by the inflation. Accepting a 43/57 split is better than risking a worse offer in a future round, or even getting nothing at all if we can't come to an agreement."
