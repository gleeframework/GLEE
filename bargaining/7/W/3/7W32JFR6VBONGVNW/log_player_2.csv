**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer at this stage is the most logical choice given the circumstances and the rapid rate of inflation eating into my potential gains. 

* **Time Pressure:**  We are past the halfway point, and Alice is clearly holding firm. Continuing to reject her offers in the hope of a significantly better deal is becoming increasingly risky.
* **Inflation Impact:** The longer this goes on, the less my share is worth. Accepting 400,000 now is better than potentially getting a slightly better split later when inflation has eroded its value even further. 
* **Guaranteed Gain:**  Accepting guarantees I receive something. Holding out carries the risk of walking away with nothing if we fail to agree. 

It's a tough pill to swallow, but sometimes a sure thing, even with a compromise, is preferable to a gamble in such a scenario."
