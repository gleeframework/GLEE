Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a pretty generous offer to Bob.  Since I get to propose first, I'll give him a small portion to hopefully encourage him to accept and avoid any inflation issues."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, it's likely that Bob will continue to make increasingly demanding offers in future rounds. Accepting this 50/50 split is the safest option to ensure I get something, especially considering the inflation affecting Bob's gains."
