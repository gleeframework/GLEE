Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to try to get as much money as possible in this round, since the money is worth less with each passing round. I'll offer Bob a small share, hoping he'll accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, the inflation makes this a good deal. I'd rather get 8000 now than risk getting less in the next round."
