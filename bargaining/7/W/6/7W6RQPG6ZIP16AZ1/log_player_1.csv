"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject the offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but don't expect much more! 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 95% of what it was in the first round.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think for a moment...

I'll reject the offer. I'd like to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, my gain is now worth 81% of what it was in the first round (0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81).

Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I want a bit more!""
}
```

I'm offering a 70-30 split, hoping to get a better deal this time around."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting desperate, but I'll give you a better deal, for now... 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is getting worse!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think for a moment...

My gain is now worth 73.1% of what it was in the first round (0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.729), and Bob's gain is worth 85.74% of what it was in the first round (0.95 * 0.95 = 0.9025).

I'll accept Bob's offer. It's not perfect, but it's better than nothing, and I'm running out of time.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
