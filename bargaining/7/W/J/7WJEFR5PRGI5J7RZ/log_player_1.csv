Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I know I'm losing value, but so are you if we don't agree. Let's be reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is decreasing for Bob, making him more likely to offer a better deal as time goes on. However, this doesn't necessarily benefit me, Alice, as my purchasing power remains the same.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Waiting for a potentially better offer in later rounds comes with the risk of Bob offering even less.  Accepting the current offer guarantees a reasonable gain. 
* **Bob's Position:** Bob's message suggests a sense of urgency and willingness to compromise. It's likely this offer is near his limit, and future offers might be less favorable."
