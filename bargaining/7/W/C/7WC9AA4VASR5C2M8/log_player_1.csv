"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  Since I'm making the first offer, I'm going to try to get a good chunk of the money. I figure Bob might be willing to accept a smaller share to get something rather than nothing if he rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to try to get a 60/40 split in my favor this round.  Bob clearly wants a larger share of the money, but I don't think he'll be willing to wait another round and see the value decrease even further.  I'm hoping he'll accept this offer to avoid the risk of getting less in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to reject this offer. Bob seems to be getting more and more greedy with each round, and I'm not willing to accept such a small share. I believe I can get a better deal in the next round.  Let's see what happens if I take the risk and wait another round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000}
```

I'm going to propose a 40/60 split in my favor this round. Bob has been trying to get a larger share with each round, but I think he might be starting to realize that he's at risk of getting nothing if he keeps rejecting my offers. I'm going to try to meet him halfway to see if we can come to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm going to accept this offer. Even though it's a small share, it's better than getting nothing.  Inflation is making the money worth less with every passing round, and I'm not sure if I can get a better deal in the next round. It's time to take what I can get!"
