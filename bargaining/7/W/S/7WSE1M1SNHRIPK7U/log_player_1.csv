"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

This way, I get 70% of the initial $100, and Bob gets 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'd rather wait for a better offer. Bob's offer is slightly worse for me than my initial offer, so I'll reject it.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","In round 3, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the fact that the money is worth 20% less than in the first round (10% less than the second round). Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 65,
  ""bob_gain"": 35
}

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","In round 5, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the fact that the money is worth 37.1% less than in the first round (10% less per round, with 3 rounds passed). Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 68,
  ""bob_gain"": 32
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","A 50/50 split! It's a fair offer, and considering the rapidly decreasing value of the money, I think it's a good time to accept and split the remaining $100.
