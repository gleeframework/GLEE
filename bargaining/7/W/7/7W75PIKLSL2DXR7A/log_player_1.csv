"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a fair deal! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of 40 is actually worth 32 (80% of 40) and Bob's gain of 60 is worth 57 (95% of 60).

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, considering the inflation. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly bigger share this time, but I still want to keep some for myself!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, which is a bit more in Bob's favor than my previous offer. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share this time, but I'm getting desperate to end this game! 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation:

My gain of 35 is worth 17.8 (48.8% of 35) and Bob's gain of 65 is worth 61.15 (85.74% of 65).

Considering the inflation, this offer is actually not as bad as it seems. I'll accept this offer.
