"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money 3:2. It's fair and reasonable. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

It's a good offer, but I think I can get more!  I'll try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's flip the script! I propose a 6:4 split in my favor. It's a fair trade, considering you'll get more in the next round.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I believe in fairness. Let's split the money equally. This should satisfy both our needs. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

Even though inflation has hurt the value of the money, a 50/50 split is a fair outcome.  I'm happy to accept."
