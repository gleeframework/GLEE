"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point""}

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and it gives us both a decent chunk of the money to work with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take a smaller share now, or you'll get even less later! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth less now, I'm more inclined to take a smaller share now rather than risking getting even less later.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
