"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering Bob 40 dollars, and I'll take the remaining 60 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'd like to get a slightly larger share to account for the decreased value. However, Bob's offer of 50-50 is a decent compromise.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
