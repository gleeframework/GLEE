# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Alice's offer is slightly better than the previous round, but I'm still not happy with the imbalance. I'll reject again and see if she's willing to budge further in the next round."

Alice's offer is the best I've seen so far, and with inflation getting worse, I can't afford to be too picky.  I'll accept and take the 4500."
