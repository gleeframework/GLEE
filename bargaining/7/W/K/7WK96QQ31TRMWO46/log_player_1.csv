I'll offer Bob a measly $1 and keep the rest.  It's a huge gamble, but I'm hoping he'll accept it to avoid the risk of getting nothing if he rejects and I get to propose again.  The inflation is unknown to me, so it could be a big factor in his decision.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though Bob is taking half, it's a much better deal than getting nothing in the next round if he rejects.  With inflation, it's very likely that the money will be worth significantly less in the next round."
