"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept and we can start fresh with a clean slate.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping to set the tone for a future negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's compromise! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, but I still get the same amount as before. I'm not sure if Bob's offer is a genuine compromise or a test to see how much I'll settle for.

I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more given the risk I'm taking.""
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive in my offer, but still leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle, no games! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rate increasing, Bob's offer is worth even less to him than before. I'm not sure if he's serious about splitting it down the middle or if he's trying to bluff.

I'll accept the offer, as it's a relatively fair split and I don't want to risk losing out on a decent share.
