Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  What do you think?

# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see if I can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split in my favor is more fair.  Let's get this done!""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's compromise.  I'll take a slightly smaller share this time, but I think 57/43 is a fair split.  Let's end this. 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is starting to hurt and this is a decent compromise. Let's end this game."
