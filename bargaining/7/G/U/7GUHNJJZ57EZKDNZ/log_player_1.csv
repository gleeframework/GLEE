Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you wanted a larger share for making the first offer, but that's no longer the case.  Let's split fairly, with a slight advantage to me to compensate for the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
