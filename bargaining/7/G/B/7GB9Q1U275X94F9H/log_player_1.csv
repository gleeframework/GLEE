This is a very aggressive offer, but it gives Alice the maximum possible gain in the first round. It's unlikely Bob will accept, but it sets the stage for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

# Bob gain: 999000

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000} 
```

This offer is a compromise, acknowledging that I won't get the full 999,999 anymore.  It's still a good deal for me, but it offers Bob a more reasonable cut.  The inflation is likely to continue to benefit me in the later rounds."

Bob is still trying to get the lion's share, but the inflation is starting to hurt him significantly. My offer in the next round will likely be closer to a 50/50 split.  The pressure is now on him."
