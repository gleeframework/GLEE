"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The offer is not in the format I expected, but I'll assume it's a proposal from Bob.

I'll respond with a decision. Since the offer is not in the format I expected, I'll make sure to specify the total amount each of us would gain in the response.

The offer from Bob is:
Alice gain: 3000
Bob gain: 7000

This means Alice would get $3000 and Bob would get $7000.

The current total is $10,000, and after the first round, the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob. After the second round, the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob again.

If I accept this offer, I would get $3000, which is worth 90% of $3000 from the first round, and 64% of $3000 from the second round. So, I would effectively get $3000 * 0.9 * 0.64 = $1920.

Similarly, Bob would get $7000, which is worth 80% of $7000 from the first round, and 52% of $7000 from the second round. So, Bob would effectively get $7000 * 0.8 * 0.52 = $3648.

I'll decide to reject the offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Now it's my turn again. Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The offer from Bob is:
Alice gain: 4000
Bob gain: 6000

To calculate the effective gain, I'll consider the inflation rates. The money is worth 10% less each round for me, and 20% less each round for Bob. After 3 rounds, the money is worth 0.9^3 = 0.729 for me, and 0.8^3 = 0.512 for Bob.

The offer from Bob is:
Alice gain: 4000
Bob gain: 6000

If I accept this offer, I would get $4000, which is worth $4000 * 0.729 = $2916 from my perspective.

Similarly, Bob would get $6000, which is worth $6000 * 0.512 = $3072 from his perspective.

I'll decide to accept the offer.
