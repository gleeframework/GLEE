"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the majority, but I'm sure we can work something out for you. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
Let's see what I can get by making a counter-offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I'm proposing a more equitable split. Let's both get a good share, and avoid any further rounds where we both lose money.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a significant portion.  Let's finalize this before we both lose more money. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer a larger share, I'm losing money each round. It's better to take the offer and secure at least something."
