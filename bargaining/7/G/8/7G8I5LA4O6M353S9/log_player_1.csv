"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'm willing to give you 400k. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000 and keeping 600,000 for myself, which seems like a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I think we can do better.  I propose a 60/40 split in my favor, reflecting my greater risk in rejecting your previous offer.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is trying to negotiate a 60/40 split in his favor, which is a pretty aggressive ask.

I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better deal for myself. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with a 60/40 split. I think that's too skewed in your favor. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to see a more balanced proposal.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation has taken its toll, and the money is now worth 95% of its original value. I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. I'll give you 450k, but I need to keep 550k for myself. Let's make a deal!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a decent share and keeping a significant amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to compromise. I'm offering you 450k, which is a fair compromise given the inflation and the fact that I've rejected your previous offer.  Let's end this negotiation and split the money. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to turn the tables on me by offering the same amount I offered in the previous round, but now he's the one making the offer.

I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate further. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure why you're offering me the same amount I offered you earlier, Bob. I'm willing to consider a slightly better offer, but I'm not going to accept the same terms as before.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now due to inflation. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 525000,
  ""bob_gain"": 475000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, Bob. I'll give you 475k, but I need to keep 525k for myself. It's a fair compromise, don't you think?""
}
```

I'm trying to find a sweet spot where I'm not giving up too much, but still making a reasonable offer to try to close the deal."
