"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, 80% to me, 20% to Bob.""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $10,000, which is $8,000, and Bob gets the remaining $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 60% and leave you with 40% 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled with the offer, but I'll consider it.

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my thinking. With the offer, I'd get $4,000, which is a decent amount, but I'd be giving up a significant portion of the initial $10,000.

I'll decide to...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 50/50 split, and end this game.""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which means we'll both get $5,000 each. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more, but still leave you with a decent share 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Another offer from Bob!

Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to be careful with my decision. With the offer, I'd get $4,500, which is still a decent amount, but I'd be giving up more than I would have liked.

I'll weigh my options and decide...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 3000, ""bob_gain"": 7000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a bigger share, but I need some room to breathe""}

I'm proposing a 70/30 split, with me getting $3,000 and Bob getting $7,000. I'm willing to give Bob a larger share, but I still need to hold onto some value considering the reduced worth of the money due to inflation."
