"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. I'm framing this as a fair starting point, but I'm open to negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle and see if we can improve from here. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob, the effective amounts are:

Alice gain: 855,000
Bob gain: 450,000

I'll accept Bob's offer for now.
