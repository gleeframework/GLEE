"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a small difference, I'll make it worth your while to accept!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000, and I'll take the remaining $9,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fairer, but let's talk.  This offer reflects a compromise, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less, my gain of $9,000 in the first round is now equivalent to $8,550.

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a reasonable compromise. I'll accept his offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
