"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take the majority and you can have a smaller share to test the waters.""
}
```

This way, I'm taking 80% of the initial $100, which is a significant portion, but still leaving Bob with a small but not insignificant amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, let's be equal for now 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 20% less, so the actual value of my gain in this round is 80% of the previous round's gain, which is 0.8 * 80 = 64.

Considering Bob's proposal, I'm not sure if it's a good idea to accept an equal split, especially since I've already proposed a 80-20 split and Bob rejected it. I'll try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure about an equal split, can you meet me at 70-30?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, my gain is worth 20% less than in the previous round, so the actual value of my gain in this round is 80% of the previous round's gain, which is 0.8 * 64 = 51.2.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share. Let's see if you can live with this.""
}
```

This time, I'm proposing a 70-30 split, which is a bit more in my favor, but still leaves Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting a bit greedy, I'll give you a smaller share, but I'm not going all the way to 30 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, so the actual value of my gain in this round is 0.516 * 80 = 41.28.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'm not thrilled about giving up more of the share, but I'm not sure if I can do better. I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Okay, fine. I'll take 40. But I'm not happy about it.""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer, but I'm not pleased about it. I think I might have been too aggressive with my previous offers."
