"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but not too much, since you didn't accept the first offer 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
It's better to take what I can get now, before inflation eats away at my potential gains further."
