"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: That wasn't very fair, Alice. How about a more even split this time? We can still get a good deal before inflation eats into it too much. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
