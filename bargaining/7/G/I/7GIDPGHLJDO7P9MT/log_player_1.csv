"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a 90/10 split in my favor. It's a risky move, but I'm hoping Bob will be happy with a little something and we can end the game quickly. Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would have preferred more, accepting this offer is the best course of action. Inflation will only continue to devalue my potential earnings.  A 50/50 split is a fair outcome considering the circumstances."
