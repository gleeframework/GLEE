"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a good base""}

I'm proposing a 4:1 split, where I get 80% and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I think 4k is a fair starting point 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer...

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not satisfied with the 3:2.5 split. I was hoping for a more even split, considering we're starting with a larger amount. I'll wait for the next round to make a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""Meeting you halfway, a slight compromise""}

I'm proposing a 7:3 split, which is a bit more in my favor than Bob's previous offer, but still a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway this time, let's split it evenly 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer...

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm surprised Bob is willing to split it evenly! Considering the money is worth less than before, I think this is a fair compromise. I'll accept the 50:50 split."
