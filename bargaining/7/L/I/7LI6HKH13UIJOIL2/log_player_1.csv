I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor. I'm hoping this will be fair enough for Bob to accept, but also secure a good chunk of the money before inflation kicks in.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I'm not thrilled about the 30/70 split, I'm taking it.  With inflation, my share will be worth less if I reject and try to negotiate again.  Better to take what I can get now!"
