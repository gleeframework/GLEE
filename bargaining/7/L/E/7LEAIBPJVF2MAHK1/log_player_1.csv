"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! I'll take 70% and you can have 30%. It's a fair starting point, don't you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. What do you think, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up that much, but I'll give you a slightly better deal. You can have 40% and I'll take 60%. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the numbers are looking a bit different now.

I'll think about it for a moment... I'd rather not give up 60% of the remaining money, but I also don't want to risk going into more rounds with decreasing values.
