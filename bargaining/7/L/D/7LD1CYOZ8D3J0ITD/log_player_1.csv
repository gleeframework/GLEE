"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'm open to negotiations""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial 100$ and keeping 60% for myself. My message is a friendly opening offer, inviting Bob to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous, I'll take this deal 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking its toll!

I'm not thrilled with the new offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I need to adjust my expectations. I'll have to think carefully before making a decision.

I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the 20% decrease in value due to inflation (10% in round 1 and 10% in round 2).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 55% of the remaining value, which is a bit more favorable to him than my previous offer. My message is a hint that I'm open to further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging, take it or leave it 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll now!

Considering the significant decrease in value, I'm not thrilled with the new offer. However, I don't want to risk getting a worse deal in future rounds. I'll have to think carefully about it.

I'll accept this offer, hoping that the game will end soon.
