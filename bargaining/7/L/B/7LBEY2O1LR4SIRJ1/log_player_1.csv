"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'm the one who's really hungry! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain is worth 90% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not thrilled with the offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
