I'm starting with a pretty aggressive offer, hoping to get most of the money in the first round. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is trying to get a better deal for himself, but I'm not satisfied with this offer yet. I'm going to try to get a better split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly, hoping to find a middle ground and get a deal done before the inflation hurts me too much."
