"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the $100 in a 75:25 ratio. This might seem a bit lopsided, but considering the risk of inflation and the uncertainty of future rounds, it might be the most reasonable approach. 
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
