"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000. The message is a straightforward one - I'm giving Bob an opportunity to take the deal or reject it and try to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly better deal. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $450,000 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, which is $360,000. And Bob's gain of $550,000 is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, which is $495,000.

I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept this offer. I'd like to try to negotiate further and see if I can get an even better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think I deserve a bit more. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 52-48 split in my favor, with me getting $520,000 and Bob getting $480,000. The message is a gentle push to see if Bob will accept this compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think this is a fair and equal split. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $500,000 is worth 40.8% of what it was in the first round, which is $408,000. And Bob's gain of $500,000 is worth 72.9% of what it was in the first round, which is $729,000.

I think this is a pretty good deal for me, considering the inflation. I'll accept Bob's offer.
