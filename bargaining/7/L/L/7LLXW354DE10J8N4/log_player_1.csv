I'll reject this offer. I was hoping for a more even split, and Bob's offer is a bit too skewed in his favor. I'll make a new offer in the next round.

{""alice_gain"": 475000, ""bob_gain"": 525000}

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Bob gain: 550000

I'll accept Bob's offer from round 6. It's not ideal, but it's better than going further and risking even more erosion of the value of the money.
