"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the total amount, which is $600,000, and Bob gets 40%, which is $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, let's see if you'll accept 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled with the offer, but I'll consider it.

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my expectations. I'll accept the offer if I can get at least 55% of the remaining amount.

In this case, I'll accept Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
