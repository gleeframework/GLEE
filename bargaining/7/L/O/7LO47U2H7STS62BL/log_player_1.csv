"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'm going to start with a fairly generous offer, hoping to secure a deal quickly.  I'll keep a large portion of the money, but still give Bob a significant share.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  It's significantly less than my previous offer, and even though I lose 10% of my potential gains due to inflation, I'm willing to hold out for a better deal. I'll be making the offer in the next round and I'm confident I can secure a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000} 
```

I'm going to reduce my offer slightly to 800,000 for myself, but I'm still offering Bob a good share.  I'm hopeful that he will accept, as the money is worth less to me with each passing round.  Let's see if he's willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly unreasonable.  While I'm losing value due to inflation, I'm still in a better position than him, as he's receiving a constant value. I'm determined to get a better deal. I'll make a new offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000} 
```

I'm going to lower my offer again, but I'm still confident I can secure a fair deal. Bob is getting increasingly greedy, but I'm not willing to give in to his demands. I'm hoping he'll realize that accepting my offer is the best way to maximize his gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly unreasonable.  I'm losing value due to inflation, but I'm still in a better position than him, as he's receiving a constant value. I'm determined to get a better deal. I'll make a new offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000} 
```

I'm making one final concession, lowering my offer to 600,000 for myself.  Bob is getting increasingly greedy, but I'm hoping he'll recognize that this is the best deal he'll get.  If he rejects this, we're both going to be losing a lot of money.  Let's see what he decides."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting absurd. It's clear he's trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I won't let him get away with it. I'm losing value, but I'm still determined to get a better deal. I'll make a new offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000} 
```

This is my final offer. I'm willing to split the money equally.  Bob is becoming increasingly unreasonable, but I'm hoping he'll see that this is the best way to maximize his gains, as well.  If he rejects this, we're both going to end up with nothing."
