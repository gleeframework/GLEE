"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point""}

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and we can adjust from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the potential for inflation. Let's see what you think. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think a 60/40 split is fair, especially since I'm already losing 10% of my potential gain due to inflation. I'd like to propose a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I think this split is more reasonable. Let's take it""}

I'm proposing that I get $5,200 and Bob gets $4,800. I'm trying to account for the reduced value of the money due to inflation, and I think this split is more reasonable."
