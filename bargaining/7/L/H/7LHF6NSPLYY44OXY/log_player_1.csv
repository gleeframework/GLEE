"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a fair share, let's end this""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small amount, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent share, but I'm not being generous 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, Bob's offer seems more generous than it initially appears. I'll think about it for a moment...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time, considering the inflation has reduced the value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""You're not being generous, so I won't be either""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, no need to be greedy 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation eating away at the value of the money, Bob's offer seems more reasonable now. Meeting in the middle seems like a fair compromise.
