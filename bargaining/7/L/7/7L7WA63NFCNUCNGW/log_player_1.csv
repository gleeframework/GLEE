"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I deserve a bit more, considering inflation hits you harder 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I understand your perspective, Bob. This offer is a compromise, taking into account the inflation factor for me.""

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is really hurting your share, I think it's time for me to take a bigger cut 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While the inflation is increasingly impacting my share, accepting only $300,000 is a terrible deal.  I need to convey the urgency of the situation to Bob and make him understand that a fairer deal is necessary to avoid both of us walking away with nothing in the end."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is getting dangerous.  My share is rapidly shrinking, and if we don't reach an agreement soon, we'll both lose out. This offer is my final compromise.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency:** The message emphasizes the urgency of the situation due to the rapid inflation impacting Alice's share. 
* **Compromise:**  Alice is making a significant concession by offering slightly more than Bob's previous offer. 
* **Finality:** By stating this is her final compromise, Alice signals the seriousness of the situation and the need for Bob to accept a deal now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're right, the longer we wait, the more you lose. I'm willing to take advantage of that. This is my final offer 
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a predatory offer. Bob is clearly exploiting the inflation mechanic to maximize his gain. Accepting $150,000 is a significant loss, and while the value will continue to decrease, I'm hoping Bob will see the lack of logic in continuing this to a point where I get nothing. It's a risky gamble, but a better alternative than accepting a severely unfair deal."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 250000,
""bob_gain"": 750000,
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you want to maximize your gain, but pushing this further is pointless. My share will soon be worth next to nothing, leaving you with no deal at all. This is my absolute last offer - let's be reasonable.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct Approach:** This message directly addresses Bob's strategy, highlighting the flaw in his logic.
* **Finality:** Emphasizing this as the ""absolute last offer"" conveys the seriousness of the situation and removes any doubt about further negotiations.
* **Compromise:**  While still a significant loss, offering $250,000 is a final attempt at compromise, demonstrating a willingness to salvage the situation.

At this point, it's a gamble whether Bob understands the concept of losing out completely if Alice's share becomes practically worthless. This offer attempts to appeal to both his rationality and his desire for a deal."
