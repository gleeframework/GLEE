Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still believe my contributions are worth more. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving towards a more balanced split, the rate of inflation is working against me faster than it is against her. Holding out a bit longer could pressure her to make a much better offer, even if it means accepting a slightly less favorable split in the next couple of rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""message"": ""Time is running out, and we both lose if this fails.  This is my final offer - I think it's more than fair considering the circumstances."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency:**  With each round, the value of the money decreases drastically. It's crucial to apply pressure on Alice.
* **Finality:**  By stating this is my final offer, I signal I'm serious and unwilling to accept a worse deal. This may push Alice to accept rather than risk getting nothing.
* **Slight Concession:** Moving slightly closer to her previous offer shows willingness to compromise, but not at the cost of a significantly worse deal for myself."
