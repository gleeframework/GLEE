Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Alright Bob, let's stop this back and forth.  This is a straight split of our previous offers.  Take it or leave it - we're running out of time! 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in Round 5 is the most logical choice given the circumstances:

* **Time Pressure:** With only 7 rounds remaining, the risk of walking away with nothing significantly increases with each rejection. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** Inflation is steadily eroding the value of the money.  Delaying an agreement only benefits the party who is less affected by inflation (Bob).
* **Unpredictable Outcome:** There's no guarantee that future offers from Alice will be better, especially with her ""take it or leave it"" stance.

It's a tough decision, but accepting a less-than-ideal offer now is better than risking a complete loss later."
