"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

This is a classic ultimatum game. I'm aiming for a high share, knowing that Bob might accept even a small amount rather than risk getting nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly better for him, but I'm still hoping for a higher share. I'm confident I can get a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to acknowledge Bob's rejection, but I'm still aiming for a substantial majority of the money.  Since we both know time is running out, I believe this offer is fair and in our best interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is increasingly attractive due to inflation, I'm still hoping for a better share. I believe I can get a more favorable offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}
```

I'm making a slight concession to acknowledge Bob's consistent rejection of my offers. However, I'm still aiming for a majority of the money. With each passing round, the value of the money decreases, making it increasingly important to reach an agreement soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is now a 50/50 split, which is the fairest outcome given the current inflation rate and the limited rounds remaining. While I prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the most rational decision considering the risk of getting nothing at all."
