Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going for a strong opening offer, aiming for a large share.  Since we have 12 rounds, I'm hoping this will be enough to incentivize Bob to accept early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is incredibly unfair. Even with inflation, I'm still getting a significantly smaller share than Bob.  I'll reject and hope to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm raising my offer slightly, but still aiming for a majority share. I need to find a balance between getting a good deal and encouraging Bob to accept before the inflation gets out of control."
