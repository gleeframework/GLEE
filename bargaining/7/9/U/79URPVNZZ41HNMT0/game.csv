700000.0,300000.0,Let's divide the money in a 7:3 ratio. I believe this is fair considering the inflation effect in future rounds.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
450000.0,550000.0,Let's split the money closer to 55/45.  It's a fairer split considering we both lose value over time with inflation.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
600000.0,400000.0,I propose a 6:4 split. This maintains a reasonable balance while accounting for inflation. I hope you find it fair.,Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,accept
