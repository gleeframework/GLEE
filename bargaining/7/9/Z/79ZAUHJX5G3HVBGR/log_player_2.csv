"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the inflation will affect us both.  Let's get this done in the first round.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation affects me more, I think this is a more suitable split.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time. The inflation is getting out of control, and we both need to be reasonable. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nSince the money is worth 36% less for me now, the actual value of my gain is 5000 * 0.64 = 3200.\nConsidering the rapid decrease in value, accepting this offer seems like the best option to minimize further losses.\n###"
