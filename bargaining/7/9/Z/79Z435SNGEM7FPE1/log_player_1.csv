"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, I'll get a decent chunk for my efforts!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I get $60 and Bob gets $40. My message is a bit cheeky, but I'm hoping Bob will accept!"

# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'll consider it.

}
```
