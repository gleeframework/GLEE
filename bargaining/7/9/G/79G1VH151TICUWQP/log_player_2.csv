Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting closer, but not quite there 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in Round 5 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:** The longer Bob waits, the less his share is worth due to the 5% inflation per round.  He's already losing a significant chunk of the potential value.
* **Alice's Strategy:** Alice is clearly aiming for a better-than-even split. Her offers have been gradually getting closer to even, but she's unlikely to offer anything significantly better than this unless Bob demonstrates extreme patience.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Holding out for another round hoping for a slightly better offer isn't worth the risk. The inflation will continue to eat away at Bob's potential gain.

Accepting the 4300 in Round 5 is better than risking an even lower offer in subsequent rounds or, in the worst case, walking away with nothing if no agreement is reached."
