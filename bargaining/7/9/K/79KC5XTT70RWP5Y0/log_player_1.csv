"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate!""
}
```

This way, we both get $500,000, and we can avoid any potential disputes. What do you think, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 400000, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to be more cautious. Bob is offering me $400,000, which is 80% of the original $500,000 I was offered in the first round, considering the 20% discount for Bob's gain. I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, but I don't want to risk waiting for the next round, when the money will be worth even less.
