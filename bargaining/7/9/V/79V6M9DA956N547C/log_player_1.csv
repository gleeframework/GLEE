"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a moderate proposal. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this new offer. With inflation, my gain is worth 20% less than before, so I'd rather get a higher share to make up for it. But I don't want to be too greedy, either. Considering the inflation factor, I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the inflation factor. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60}

I'm trying to be more aggressive this time, given the reduced value of money due to inflation."
