"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""I propose we split it 8000 for me and 2000 for you. This allows us both to have a fair share while considering the risk of inflation.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 4000 for me is a bit low. This offer gives me a slightly larger share, but still leaves you with a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
