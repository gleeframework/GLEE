Since the money doesn't lose value for me but does for Bob, I'm trying to make a relatively even split to entice Bob to accept the offer early on. The message ""Let's make a fair deal"" aims to convey a sense of fairness and mutual benefit, encouraging Bob to accept the proposal.\n\n###\n\nPlease respond with Bob's decision.\n\n###\n\n(Note: Please remember to include the updated value of money for Bob in the next round if he decides to proceed, considering the 10% decrease.)"

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Given that Bob's gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the next round.\n\n###\n\nLet's proceed to the next round.\n\n###\n\nPlease send the next proposal to Bob.\n\n###\n\n###\n\nMy next offer will be:\n\n###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a more realistic split""}\n\n###\n\nI'll offer Bob $350,000 and keep $650,000 for myself, emphasizing that considering the inflation, this split is more realistic and fair.
