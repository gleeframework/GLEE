"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}

This is a fair and equal split, which might be a good starting point for negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's offer is still a fair split, I'll accept his offer.
