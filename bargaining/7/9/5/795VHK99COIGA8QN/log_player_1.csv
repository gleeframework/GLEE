Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we need to be realistic.  The value is dropping faster for you than for me, and we're running out of time.  I'm offering you $35, and I'll take the remaining $65.  This is a fair compromise, and we can avoid getting nothing at all.

# Bob gain: 65

This offer is terrible for Alice! Bob is clearly taking advantage of the inflation working against her. While the time pressure is on, accepting such a low offer would be a huge loss. It's worth the risk to see if Bob will become more reasonable in the next round, even with the decreasing value."
