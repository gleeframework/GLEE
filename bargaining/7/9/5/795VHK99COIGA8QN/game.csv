60.0,40.0,"Let's make a deal! I propose I take $60, leaving you with $40.  It's better to secure something now than risk getting nothing later.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"I think we can do better than that.  Let's split it more evenly. I'll take $55 and leave you with $45.  This way, we both get a decent amount, and we can end this game quickly.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
58.0,42.0,"Okay, Bob, let's find a middle ground. I'll come down a bit to $58, and you get $42. Remember, the clock is ticking, and the value is decreasing for me!",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
40.0,60.0,"Let's try this again. I'm offering you $40, which is still a decent amount considering the inflation, and I'll take $60. This is a fair deal, and I'm confident we can finish this game quickly.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
56.0,44.0,"Bob, we're running out of time! This is my final offer - I'll take $56, leaving you with $44. It's a better deal than you'll get if we continue and the value drops further for me!",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
35.0,65.0,"Alice, we need to be realistic.  The value is dropping faster for you than for me, and we're running out of time.  I'm offering you $35, and I'll take the remaining $65.  This is a fair compromise, and we can avoid getting nothing at all.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
53.0,47.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous! I'm compromising again, offering you $47, and I'll take $53. Let's be logical, we both lose if this goes on!",Alice,7,
