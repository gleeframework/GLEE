Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer was a bit lopsided. Let's be more realistic. I propose a 70/30 split in my favor.  This reflects a stronger starting point for me, considering the inflation working against us both. 
# Alice gain: 30

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time, and the inflation is eating into our potential gains.  I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor.  It's a fair deal that gives us both a reasonable share before the money loses even more value.
