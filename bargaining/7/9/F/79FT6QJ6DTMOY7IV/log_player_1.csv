I propose to take $9000 and give Bob $1000. This way, I secure a majority of the money while still offering Bob a small amount to potentially incentivize him to accept. Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I'm still aiming for a majority share.  I'm offering Bob $2500, which is a significant increase from the last round. Hopefully, he'll be willing to accept."

Bob is getting increasingly greedy! I'm not going to accept an offer where I get less than half. I'll try to negotiate a fairer deal in the next round."
