Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to move a little closer to your offer, but I think a 45/55 split is more fair given the inflation factor.  Let's find some middle ground before we lose even more. 
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, it's still heavily skewed in her favor, especially considering the inflation working against me.  I need to signal I'm willing to negotiate but won't accept a deal where I lose significantly more value over time."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable.  The inflation is hurting both of us. A 50/50 split is the fairest solution right now.  I'm not going to accept anything less, and we're running out of time. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer a slightly better split, accepting a 50/50 deal at this point is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The longer this drags on, the less my share is worth. Accepting now cuts my losses. 
* **Alice's Stance:** She's made it clear she won't accept anything less. Holding out for a better deal is risky, and we could both end up with nothing.
* **Time Pressure:**  With only a few rounds remaining, the risk of losing everything significantly outweighs the potential for a slightly larger gain."
