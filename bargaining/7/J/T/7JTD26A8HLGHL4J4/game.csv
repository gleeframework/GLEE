350000.0,650000.0,"Alice, that's a terrible deal for me! Let's be realistic. I propose a 65/35 split in my favor. Take it or leave it, the clock is ticking, and inflation is eating away at our potential gains.",Bob,2,

450000.0,550000.0,"I'm willing to move a little closer to your offer, but I think a 45/55 split is more fair given the inflation factor.  Let's find some middle ground before we lose even more.",Alice,3,

400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, we need to find a solution quickly. I'm willing to meet you halfway with a 60/40 split. This offer considers the inflation working against me. Let's close this deal before we both lose out.",Bob,4,

500000.0,500000.0,"Bob, let's be reasonable.  The inflation is hurting both of us. A 50/50 split is the fairest solution right now.  I'm not going to accept anything less, and we're running out of time.",Alice,5,
