9000.0,1000.0,Let's start with a fair deal. I'll take 90% and you can have 10%. We can always adjust later.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
5000.0,5000.0,Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest way to start.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
8000.0,2000.0,"I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a larger share. 80/20 seems like a fair compromise given inflation.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4000.0,6000.0,I'm willing to give you more than 50% to make this happen.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.,Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
7500.0,2500.0,I'm still feeling the effects of inflation.  75/25 seems like a reasonable compromise for both of us. Let's get this done.,Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
3000.0,7000.0,This is my final offer.  Inflation is making this deal worse for you with each round. Let's settle before it's too late.,Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
7000.0,3000.0,We are getting dangerously close to the deadline.  Let's meet in the middle at 70/30. This is my final offer.,Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
2500.0,7500.0,"I'm raising my offer again to 75/25.  This is my final offer, and we are running out of time.  Let's reach a compromise before it's too late.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
6500.0,3500.0,We're running out of time.  I'm lowering my offer slightly to 65/35.  This is my final offer before we both get nothing.,Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
2000.0,8000.0,"We're in the final stretch, and I'm willing to go higher.  80/20 is my final offer. If we don't agree now, we both get nothing.  Let's be reasonable and end this game.",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
6000.0,4000.0,"This is it, Alice. We're down to the wire. I'm going to stick with my previous offer: 60/40. It's the best we can do.  Accept this or we get nothing.",Alice,11,
