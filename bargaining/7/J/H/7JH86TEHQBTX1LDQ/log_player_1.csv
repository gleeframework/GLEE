"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","That's a pretty one-sided offer!

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a more balanced offer this time.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60
}"
