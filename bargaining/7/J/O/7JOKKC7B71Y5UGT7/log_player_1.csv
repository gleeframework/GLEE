Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to be greedy and try to take almost everything. I'm hoping Bob will be reasonable enough to take $1, rather than risk getting nothing in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I'd prefer to get more, it's better to take half than risk getting nothing in the next round. The inflation makes the potential gain in future rounds too risky for me."
