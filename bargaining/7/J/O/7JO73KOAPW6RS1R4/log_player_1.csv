"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take $600,000 and you can take $400,000. We can discuss further if you'd like to propose a different split.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a relatively generous offer considering the high stakes."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, with me getting the bigger share.  Let's see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to turn the tables on me.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not going to accept this offer, as I think I can do better than a 40% share. I'll try to negotiate further and aim for a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation taking its toll, the money is worth 10% less now. Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. How about a 55-45 split in my favor? It's a more balanced offer than the initial 60-40, and I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a sweet spot where I can get a decent share while still giving Bob a significant amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a small share, but I'm still hoping for a 70/30 split in my favor. This is my final offer before we both risk losing more money due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is taking a toll!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not going to accept a 30% share, especially considering the inflation is eating away at the value of the money. I'll try to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The value of the money is continuing to erode. Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I still think I deserve a bit more. How about a 48-52 split in my favor?""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and not getting too greedy, considering the inflation is making the money worth less and less."
