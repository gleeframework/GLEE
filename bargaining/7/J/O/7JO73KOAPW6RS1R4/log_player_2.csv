Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I still think I deserve a bit more. How about a 48-52 split in my favor? 
# Bob gain: 520000 
# Alice gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll take it!  While it's not ideal, the inflation is making the potential gains smaller with each round. I'd rather get something than risk getting nothing."
