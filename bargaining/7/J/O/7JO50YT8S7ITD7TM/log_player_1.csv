"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

This is a fairly aggressive first offer, but I believe it's a good starting point. It shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I also value my share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This is a very unfair offer, and while I'm losing value due to inflation, I'm not willing to accept such a drastic shift in the balance.  I'll continue to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35}
```

This is a compromise offer, acknowledging that Bob may be willing to negotiate a bit closer to 50/50. However, I still aim to maintain a significant portion of the money, given the inflation disadvantage."
