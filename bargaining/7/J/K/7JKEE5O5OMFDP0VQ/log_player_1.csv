"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}
``` 
 
I propose a split of 990,000 for me and 10,000 for Bob.  This is a good starting point, and I believe Bob will see the value in taking this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I reject this offer. Although the offer is better than the previous round, my share is still too low. I'm hoping to get a more equitable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
``` 

I propose a 550,000 / 450,000 split. This is a more balanced offer that considers the inflation impacting both of us. I'm confident this will be more appealing than Bob's previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the inflation has significantly devalued Bob's offer, it's still the best option I've been presented with so far. The value of my share has decreased, but it's better than risking a further decrease in the next round, especially with the uncertainty of Bob's potential offers."
