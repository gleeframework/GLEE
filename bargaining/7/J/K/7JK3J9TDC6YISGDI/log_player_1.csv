Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer, taking into account the 20% inflation that has occurred since the first round:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I still want a fair share""
}
```"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much more, I want a fair share too 
# Alice gain: 3800 
# Bob gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on my potential earnings.

Considering the reduced value of money, I'll have to be more cautious. However, Bob's offer is still slightly better than my previous one, and I don't want to risk getting an even worse deal in the next round.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
