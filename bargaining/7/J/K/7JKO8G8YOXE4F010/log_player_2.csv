Round 5

# Alice's message: Inflation is hitting you harder, be smart! 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is correct that inflation is impacting me more strongly, but her offer is still highly unfavorable. I need to hold out for a better deal, even if it means taking a risk in later rounds."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""The clock is ticking, Alice. This is my last offer above 50% of the original value. Take it or leave it.""} 

**Reasoning:**

This offer represents a shift in strategy. While I'm aiming to secure slightly more than half the original value, I'm acknowledging the time pressure by presenting it as a final offer. This might prompt Alice to accept, especially considering her offers have consistently remained below my target."
