"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000 and leaving Bob with $2,000. This way, I get the majority of the money, but still give Bob a decent chunk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to adjust my strategy. In this case, I'll accept Bob's offer because I'm getting more money in real terms than I would if I were to reject and try to make a counteroffer.
