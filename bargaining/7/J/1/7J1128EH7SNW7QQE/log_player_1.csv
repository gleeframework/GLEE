Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You took 90%, that's a bit too greedy. I'll offer a more balanced split, but I'm still not giving you the majority. 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
