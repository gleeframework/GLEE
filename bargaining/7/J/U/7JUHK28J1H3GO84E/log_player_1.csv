"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you $100,000, a fair starting point. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount to start with, in the hopes that he will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a fair starting point is to give you $100000 and keep $900000 for myself. Let's see how this goes! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: $100,000 x 0.9 = $90,000
Bob gain: $900,000 (no change)

I'll reject Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me only $90,000, especially since Bob is keeping the majority of the money. I'll make a new offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you $200,000, a slightly better offer. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm trying to increase the amount I'm offering Bob, while still keeping a significant portion of the money for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you $200000, but I need more than that to be satisfied.  Let's work together to find a solution. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value!

Since the money is worth 27.1% less due to inflation, the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: $200,000 x 0.7279 = $145,580
Bob gain: $800,000 (no change)

I'll reject Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me only $145,580, especially since Bob is keeping the majority of the money. I'll make a new offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you $400,000, a more generous offer. Let's wrap this up!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent amount for myself and giving Bob a reasonable share, while also keeping in mind the decreasing value of the money due to inflation."
