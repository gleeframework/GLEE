Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want a good deal. Let's end this now with a perfectly even split. It's the most rational choice considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000
