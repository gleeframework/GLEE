"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's end the game!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we each get $500,000. This seems like a fair and straightforward offer, and I hope Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have 40% 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it.

Since my money is worth the same as in the first round, I'll think about it from a purely financial perspective. If I accept this offer, I'll get $400,000, which is 40% of the total amount. While it's not a bad offer, I was hoping for a more even split.

However, considering the inflation and the fact that my money is worth the same as in the first round, I'll decide to...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was not satisfactory, I'll make a new proposal.

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""A slightly better offer, hoping you'll accept this time!""}

I'm proposing a 45/55 split, where I'll get $450,000 and Bob will get $550,000. I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to Bob, considering the inflation and the fact that my money is still worth the same as in the first round."
