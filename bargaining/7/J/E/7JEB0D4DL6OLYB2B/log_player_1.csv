"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 60/40. I think this is a more reasonable and fair division, considering we're already in the second round and the money's value is decreasing. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
