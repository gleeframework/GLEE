"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less now, I need to adjust my expectations accordingly. Given that Bob's offer is still a 55/45 split, I'll accept it.
