"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Your turn!  I'm feeling generous, but let's make it snappy, this inflation is no joke.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejecting Alice's offer:** Alice's initial offer heavily favored her. It made sense to reject and counter-propose.
* **Round 2 Offer:**  
    * Bob understands time is against him due to the higher inflation rate. 
    * The offer is still slightly in Bob's favor to incentivize Alice to accept quickly. 
    * The message adds a bit of personality and subtly highlights the time pressure."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, let's split the difference! 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation is hurting:**  While Alice's offer is closer to a ""fair"" split, the inflation is eating into Bob's potential gains. Accepting now would mean losing a significant chunk of the initial value.
* **Alice is likely feeling the pressure:** Alice's more casual message and move towards a more even split suggests she also wants to avoid further rounds and losses due to inflation.
* **Leverage for a better deal:** By rejecting, Bob signals he's willing to play the long game, hoping Alice will offer a better deal in the next round to avoid even further losses from inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Okay, enough games.  Let's end this with a fair split before this money is worth nothing!""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time pressure is mounting:** By round 4, the inflation has significantly eroded the value of the initial $10,000. 
* **Going for the ""fair"" split:** Offering a 50/50 split is the most logical move at this point. It's unlikely Alice will accept anything less favorable to her, and further delays hurt both players.
* **Direct message:** The message is designed to emphasize the urgency and the fairness of the offer, hoping to nudge Alice toward accepting."
