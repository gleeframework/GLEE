"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $400,000 and keep $600,000 for myself.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent chunk, but I'm not giving away too much 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my share of $300,000 is now worth 95% of what it was in the first round, which is $285,000.

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but it's better than nothing. I'll accept it.
