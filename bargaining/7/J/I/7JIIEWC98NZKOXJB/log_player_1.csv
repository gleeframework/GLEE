Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take a slight lead""}

I'm proposing that I get 60 dollars and Bob gets 40 dollars. I'm framing it as a ""fair"" split, but also taking a slight lead. Let's see if Bob accepts or rejects my offer!"
