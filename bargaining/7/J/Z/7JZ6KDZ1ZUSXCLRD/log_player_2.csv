Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob. This offer is still better for me, but it gives you a chance to get a good share too. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, it's still heavily in her favor.  The rate of inflation is hurting me much faster than her, so holding out for a slightly better offer this round is a risk worth taking."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Time is running out Alice, and inflation is eating our potential gains.  This is a fair split.""}
