"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This offer gives me a larger share, but it also leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate in the next round if he rejects it.  I'm hoping to secure a good portion of the money while avoiding the inflation that would hit me harder in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is worse for me than my initial offer, even with the inflation considered.  I'll reject and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

I'm offering a slightly higher share to Bob than my original offer, hoping to incentivize him to accept.  Inflation is now a factor for both of us, and I'm confident that I can get a better deal than Bob's offer from the previous round."
