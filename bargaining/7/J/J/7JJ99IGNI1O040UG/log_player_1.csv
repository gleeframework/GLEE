Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bigger share to make it worthwhile. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is moving in the right direction, it's still not advantageous for me. Here's why:

* **Time advantage:** I have time on my side.  The longer Bob waits, the less his potential share is worth due to the inflation working against him.
* **Target amount:** My goal is to secure a significantly larger share than Bob.  Waiting for a better offer is the optimal strategy at this point."

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're both losing money with each passing round. Let's be practical and agree on a deal that benefits us both. I'm willing to take a smaller share to ensure we both get something. 
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is feeling the pressure of the inflation, and his offers are getting more reasonable. However, I'm still in a strong position.  Here's why:

* **Inflation impact:** The value of Bob's potential share is decreasing rapidly.  Every round that passes gives me a stronger negotiating position.
* **Target in sight:** My goal of securing a significantly larger portion of the money is within reach.  I'm willing to push a bit further."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 750000,
""bob_gain"": 250000,
""message"": ""This is my final offer, Bob. Take it or leave it.  You're running out of time and options.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's time to apply pressure and present a ""take-it-or-leave-it"" offer.  This approach aims to:

* **Force a decision:** Bob is running out of time and the value of his potential share is dwindling.  This forces him to make a critical decision. 
* **Maintain a strong position:** While I'm slightly lowering my demand, I'm still securing a significantly larger portion of the money.
* **Avoid losing everything:**  While I'm confident in my position, dragging this out further risks losing everything if no agreement is reached."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I need a bigger share to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to accept your previous offer. Let's end this stalemate and both walk away with something. 
# Alice gain: 750000 
# Bob gain: 250000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has finally agreed to my previous offer. While I could potentially push for more in the remaining rounds, there's a risk that Bob might become even more risk-averse and propose increasingly unfavorable deals. Accepting now secures a significant victory and guarantees a positive outcome."
