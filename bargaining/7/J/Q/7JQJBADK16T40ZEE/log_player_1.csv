"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. What do you say, Bob?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but still a fair deal! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, my gain of $4000 is now worth $3600.

I'm not sure I like the asymmetry of the offer, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of!""
}
```

I'm trying to negotiate a bit more in my favor, but still leaving room for a possible agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, my gain of $3500 is now worth $2569.50.
