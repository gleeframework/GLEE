"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly, no need for negotiations""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial amount, which is $4000, and I'll take the remaining $6000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take this offer 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't think Bob's offer is as generous as he thinks!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer. His gain is now worth 10% less than in the previous round, so $7000 is actually worth $6300. I'd rather wait for a better offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, it's a fair split""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to take a slightly smaller share, hoping Bob will accept this compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'll take a bigger share 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not getting desperate yet!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer again. His gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, so $5500 is actually worth $4000. I think I can do better than this!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
 ""message"": ""We're running out of time, let's split it 50/50""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept this fair and equal division of the remaining money."
