"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This way, I get 80% of the original amount, and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since Bob's offer is still a 60-40 split, I'll decide to reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, the total value is now $9,000. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7200,
  ""bob_gain"": 2800
}
```

This way, I'm aiming for a slightly higher share, but still leaving room for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the significant reduction in value due to inflation, Bob's offer seems more appealing. A 50-50 split is a fair compromise, considering the reduced value of the money. I'll decide to accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
