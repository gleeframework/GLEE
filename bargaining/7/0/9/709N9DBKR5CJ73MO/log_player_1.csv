"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 

This is a classic game theory scenario.  I'm aiming for a highly lopsided split in my favor in the first round, as I'm assuming Bob will be risk-averse and accept a small gain.  

I'll be interested to see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It's a fair offer, and I don't know how inflation will affect Bob's offers in future rounds.  It's better to accept the 50/50 split now and avoid the risk of getting nothing."
