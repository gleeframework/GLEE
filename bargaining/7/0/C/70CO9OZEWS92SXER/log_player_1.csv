I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. I believe this is a fair starting point, considering I am making the first offer.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While a 50/50 split seems fair on the surface, I'm not comfortable accepting it. Even though I'm losing money due to inflation, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'll see if I can negotiate something more advantageous in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm willing to compromise, but I still believe I deserve a larger share. This offer reflects the inflation that has occurred and is still more favorable to me than a 50/50 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While the inflation is hurting me, I'm still not ready to accept such a drastic drop in my share. I believe I can still get a better deal with more rounds left to play."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm adjusting my offer again, recognizing the increasing inflation, but I'm still pushing for a larger share. This offer is a 60/40 split in my favor, which I believe is still fair considering my initial proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still not willing to accept such a low share of the money, especially considering the inflation is hurting me more than Bob. I'll try to get a better deal in the next round."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm realizing the inflation is becoming a serious factor.  I'm willing to accept a 50/50 split to avoid risking getting nothing at all."
