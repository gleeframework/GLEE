"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, and I'll take the remaining $600,000. This way, we can both get a significant amount of money and avoid the risk of a long and potentially inflationary negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants to mirror my initial offer. I'll decide whether to accept or reject this offer.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
