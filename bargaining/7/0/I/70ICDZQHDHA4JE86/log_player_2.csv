Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to go for a very aggressive 90/10 split. Alice's offers have been getting worse, and I'm not sure how much longer I can keep rejecting them before we both get nothing.  I'm hoping she'll recognize that taking something is better than nothing, especially with inflation hitting us both so hard."

Alice's offers are getting increasingly ridiculous. It's clear she's trying to take advantage of the situation. I'm not going to settle for such a small portion of the money, even with inflation hitting us both hard. I'll continue to hold out for a better deal."

I'm making a final push with a 95/5 split. This is my last chance to get a decent share of the money. Alice has been rejecting every offer, and we're running out of time.  Inflation is taking a heavy toll, but I'm hoping she'll realize that accepting something is better than losing everything."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 10.

This is just insulting! Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the situation.  I'm not going to accept such a pittance. Even with inflation, I have to hold out for a better offer. We're almost out of time, but I still believe there's a chance for a more fair deal."

This is my final offer. It's a 99/1 split in my favor. We're both losing money rapidly due to inflation, but this is the best I can offer. Alice has been rejecting every offer, and I'm hoping she'll realize that taking a small share is better than getting nothing at all."
