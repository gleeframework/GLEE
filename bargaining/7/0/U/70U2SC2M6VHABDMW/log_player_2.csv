"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I propose we split it 60/40, with me getting the larger share. We can always adjust in later rounds if needed. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

It's a good starting point, but I'm not sure about the 60/40 split right away. Let's see what happens if I counter."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is a more balanced starting point.  It gives us both a good amount, and we can adjust if needed in later rounds.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at a 50/50 split.  This is fair and avoids us both losing more money to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Let's take the 50/50. With the inflation, it's better to secure what we can get now rather than risk a further loss in the next round."
