Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is a more balanced starting point.  It gives us both a good amount, and we can adjust if needed in later rounds. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500
