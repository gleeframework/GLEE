45.0,55.0,"I think a 55/45 split is more fair, as we both get a good amount.  Let's end this quickly and avoid the inflation!",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I believe my initial offer was already quite fair.  Considering the inflation, taking 45 now is worth even less than my first offer.  Let's settle this now with 55/45.",Alice,3,
