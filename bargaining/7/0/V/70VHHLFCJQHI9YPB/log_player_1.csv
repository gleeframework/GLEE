"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the $100, leaving Bob with 20%. This is a fair starting point, and I hope Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more balanced split is fairer. Let's try this. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

I'll evaluate Bob's offer:

* Alice gain: 45 (worth 90% of the original $100, considering the 10% inflation)
* Bob gain: 55 (worth 95% of the original $100, considering the 5% inflation)

I think this is a reasonable offer, but I'd like to try to get a bit more. I'll reject the offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering a 50-50 split, hoping to meet Bob in the middle and end the game."
