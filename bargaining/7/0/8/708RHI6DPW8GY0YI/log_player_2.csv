"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. A 55/45 split seems reasonable. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see if I can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better, I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need a bigger share for myself to make it worthwhile. What do you say?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's stop wasting time. I'm offering a 50/50 split.  This is fair and avoids further losses due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

A 50/50 split is a fair outcome, and further rounds risk losing money for both of us."
