"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}

I'm offering to take 80% of the $10,000, leaving Bob with 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the decreased value of the money, my initial reaction is that Bob's offer is even more generous than I expected. I'll consider it.
