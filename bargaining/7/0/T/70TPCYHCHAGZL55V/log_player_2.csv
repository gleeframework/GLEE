# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nSince the offer is to split the money evenly, which is the most fair outcome, I will accept this offer to ensure we both get an equal share and avoid the risk of getting nothing if we fail to agree within the 12 rounds."
