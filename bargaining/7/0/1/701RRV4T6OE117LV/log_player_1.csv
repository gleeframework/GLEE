"Round 1

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you say?""

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time. It's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I can still consider the offer in terms of the original $10,000.

However, I don't think splitting it evenly is the best deal for me, especially since I was willing to offer Bob $2000 in the first round. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.
