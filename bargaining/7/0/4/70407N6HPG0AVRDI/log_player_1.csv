"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can split the money fairly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, let's end this! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new values due to inflation, I'll reassess the offer.

My gain of $5,000 is worth 80% of the original $6,000 (since 20% was lost to inflation), which is $4,800. Bob's gain of $5,000 is worth 90% of the original $4,000 (since 10% was lost to inflation), which is $4,500.

I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal, but I'll consider it. However, I'll make a counteroffer to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll consider your offer, but I'd like to counter with 5500 for me and 4500 for you.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, my gain of $5,500 is now worth 80% of $6,750 (which is the 80% of $8,500, since $5,500 is 80% of $6,875), which is $5,400. Bob's gain of $4,500 is now worth 90% of $5,000, which is $4,500.

However, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced values.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal this time, let's end this!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I want more! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the values of the offer due to inflation.

My gain of $5,200 is worth 51.2% of the original $10,000 (since 48.8% was lost to inflation), which is $5,120. Bob's gain of $4,800 is worth 72.9% of the original $6,600 (since 27.1% was lost to inflation), which is $3,484.4.

However, Bob's new offer is for $4,500 for me and $5,500 for him. Let's calculate the values of these amounts due to inflation.

My gain of $4,500 is worth 45% of the original $10,000, which is $4,500. Bob's gain of $5,500 is worth 55% of the original $10,000, which is $5,500.

I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""I'll accept your offer, it seems like a fair deal!""
}
```"
