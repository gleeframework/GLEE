Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm offering you $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. The money is worth less to you in each round, so it's in your best interest to accept this offer before it's worth even less. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
