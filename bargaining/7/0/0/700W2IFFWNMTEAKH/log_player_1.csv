"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you can take 40%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle. I'll take 50% and you can take 50% 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less now, the actual amounts I would gain are $5,000 * 0.9 = $4,500.

I'm not willing to accept a 50-50 split, as I'd rather try to negotiate for more. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to negotiate further. I'll take 55% and you can take 45%""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth 10% less again, so the total amount is now $9,000. Since the money Bob gains is still worth the same as in the first round, his gain is still $5,000.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise further. I'll take 55% and you can take 45% again""
}
```

I'm sticking with the 55-45 split, hoping Bob will accept this time."
