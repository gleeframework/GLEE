"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm curious to see Bob's response!"

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve more since I'm the one making the proposal this round 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 10% less, so I need to be careful. Bob's offer is a bit more generous, but I'm not sure if it's enough.

```

}
```

I'll reject this offer and wait for the next round. Maybe I can negotiate a better deal in the next round!"

Round 3

  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more this round. Can we meet in the middle?""

# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on my gain! With the money being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I need to be very careful. Bob's offer is a bit more generous, but I'm not sure if it's enough.

```

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3800,
  ""bob_gain"": 6200,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to be realistic about the inflation, but I think I deserve a bit more. Can we meet in the middle and try to make this work?""
