"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted a fair start, now it's my turn to be greedy! 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is being greedy, indeed!

I'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""You're being a bit too greedy, Bob! Let's find a middle ground.""
}
```

I'm adjusting the split to 42-58 in my favor, but still leaving Bob with a decent share. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still want a slight edge! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is still being a bit greedy, but I can see he's trying to compromise.

However, considering the effect of inflation, Bob's gain is now worth even less than in the previous round, so I'll consider this a slightly better offer than before.

I'll accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

Let's see if I can get a better deal next time!"
