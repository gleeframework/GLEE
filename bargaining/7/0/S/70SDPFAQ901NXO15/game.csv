6000.0,4000.0,"Let's start with a reasonable offer. I take $6,000, you take $4,000.  This way we both benefit from finishing the game early.",Alice,1,

4000.0,6000.0,"I'll take $6,000 and give you $4,000.  This is a fair split, and we can avoid losing money to inflation.",Bob,2,

5800.0,4200.0,"I understand you want a larger share, but my previous offer was more than fair. Let's settle this now and avoid further losses. I'll take $5,800 and you get $4,200.",Alice,3,

3500.0,6500.0,"I'm willing to give you a little more, but I still need a larger share to make this worthwhile.  Let's split it $6,500 for me and $3,500 for you. We are both losing money with each round.",Bob,4,

5600.0,4400.0,"Bob, we're approaching a critical point where the inflation is eating significantly into our potential gains. I'm offering you $4,400, which is more than your last offer would be worth in the next round. Let's be sensible and end this here.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
3000.0,7000.0,"Alice, we're losing a lot of money to inflation.  Let's split it $7,000 for me and $3,000 for you.  This is the best way to maximize what we can get before the remaining value is too low.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Bob, it's clear we both want a larger share, but this stubbornness is hurting us both. The inflation is becoming critical.  Let's take an even split of $5,000 each before it's too late. This is the fairest and most logical option at this point.",Alice,7,
