"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40. It's a fair start.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000. My message to Bob is that it's a fair start, and I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's give you a slightly smaller share, but still a decent offer 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth less due to inflation, I'm not as eager to accept a smaller share. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that this is a decent offer, and I'd like to see if I can do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle. This is a fair 50-50 split.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, with each of us getting $500,000. My message to Bob is that this is a fair and even split, and I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game here."
