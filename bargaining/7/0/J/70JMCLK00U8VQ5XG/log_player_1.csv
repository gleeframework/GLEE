"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor, as I'm the first to propose and I want to secure a large share.  Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, a 50/50 split is a fair outcome considering the inflation. Accepting this offer guarantees me a significant portion of the money, and rejecting it risks losing everything."
