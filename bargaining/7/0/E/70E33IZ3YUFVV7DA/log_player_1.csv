"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving each of us $500,000. This is a good starting point, and I hope Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, but I need a bit more to make it worthwhile. Let's see if you'll accept this! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the uneven split, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

After some thought, I'll make a decision:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept an uneven split, especially since I'll be getting 40% less than Bob. I'll try to negotiate or make a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 420000, ""bob_gain"": 580000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more. Let's try to find a middle ground.""}

I'm proposing a slightly more uneven split, but still trying to be reasonable and find a compromise. I'm willing to give up a bit more to get closer to a deal."
