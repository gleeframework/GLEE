"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. Take this 10% and we can both be happy! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's tempting to take a quick 1000$, I want to see what kind of deal Alice is willing to make if she has to propose again."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly. I'm taking into account that the money is worth less with each round. How does 5500 for me and 4500 for you sound?""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. I'm willing to give you a larger share, but we need to reach an agreement soon. The longer we wait, the less our money is worth. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting this offer. It's good that Alice is willing to offer more, but I'm still hoping for a better split. I'm going to see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
