"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, 70-30 in my favor.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 30 dollars, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept it and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I want a bigger piece of the pie 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting already!

Considering the new values, I'm not thrilled about the 20 dollars I'd get, but I don't want to risk going to the next round and losing even more value. I'll accept Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
