"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

I'm offering Bob $30, and I'll take the remaining $70."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less now, I'll consider the actual amounts I'll receive in this round.

My share would be 45 / 0.9 = 50, and Bob's share would be 55 / 0.9 = 61.11.

I'll reject this offer because I'd be getting less than in the previous round. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 10% less again, I'll make a new offer.

I'll offer Bob $40, and I'll take the remaining $60. 

{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60}"
