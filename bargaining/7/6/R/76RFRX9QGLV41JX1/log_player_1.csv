I'll propose a split of $900,000 for me and $100,000 for Bob. This is a fairly generous offer, but it's important to get the ball rolling and avoid losing too much to inflation.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is quite unfair.  It's only worth 20% of the money I was originally offered, and it's clear he's taking advantage of the inflation. I'm going to reject this and try to negotiate a fairer deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob $400,000.  This is a more balanced split than his last offer, and it's still enough for him to get a decent portion of the money. Hopefully, he'll see that this is a fair deal and accept it before we lose more to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is even worse than his previous one. I'm  losing even more ground with each passing round, but I won't be bullied into accepting such a terrible deal.  Let's see if Bob is willing to negotiate something more fair in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation.  I'm going to offer him an even split of the money.  This is a fair deal, and hopefully, he'll accept it before we both lose too much more to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I refuse to accept another unfair offer from Bob. He is trying to take advantage of the inflation, and I will not allow him to take such a large portion of the money. I am still hoping we can reach a fair agreement, but I won't cave to his demands."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob $600,000 this time.  He's been consistently trying to take more than his fair share, but I'm hoping that this offer, which is still more than he's offered me, will convince him to settle for a deal before we both lose even more to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still not fair. I'm not going to accept anything less than a 50/50 split. We're both losing a lot of money to inflation, and I'm not going to let him take advantage of that.  Let's see if he's willing to negotiate a more even split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

It's clear Bob is playing a risky game, but I'm not willing to lose any more money to inflation. I'm going to offer him a 50/50 split. It's the fairest deal, and it's still a lot of money for both of us. Hopefully, he'll come to his senses and accept it before we both end up with nothing."
