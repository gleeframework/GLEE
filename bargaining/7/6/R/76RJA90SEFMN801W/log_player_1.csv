"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 40% and keep 60%""
}
```

I'm starting with a 60/40 split, which seems fair to me. What do you think, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, I'll give you 50% and take 50% 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 20% less for me, so $5000 is equivalent to $4000 in the first round. I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, considering the inflation effect.

I'll reject the offer for now.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll aim for a slightly higher percentage to account for the decrease in value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I need to keep a majority to account for the inflation""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm still not comfortable with the majority 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money!

Considering the new offer, I think I'll accept it. The 52/48 split is closer to my initial offer, and I'm not sure if I can get a better deal in the next round.
