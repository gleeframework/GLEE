Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a fairly generous offer.  I'm hoping Bob will accept, as I don't want to lose too much to inflation.  Let's see how he reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more, accepting this offer is the best option. The inflation is hitting me hard and if I reject this, there is a high chance Bob will propose an even worse offer in the next round.  I don't want to risk getting even less."
