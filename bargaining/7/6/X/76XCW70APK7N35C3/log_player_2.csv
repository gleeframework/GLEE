Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, this is a fair deal 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800

""alice_gain"": 4600,

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm not buying it 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit my disadvantage with the inflation.  While the pressure is mounting, accepting this offer would mean losing a significant chunk of the potential gain. I'll hold out a little longer and see if I can get her to move closer to a 50/50 split."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Okay, Alice, let's be realistic.  The clock is ticking, and we both lose if this falls through. I'm willing to take a slight hit on my end, but this is the best I can offer.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting desperate, I can see that. But I'm not backing down 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is killing me. While this offer is far from ideal, rejecting it means risking getting even less in future rounds. Alice is clearly playing hardball, and at this point, it's better to secure something rather than risk getting nothing at all."
