"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I propose a 60/40 split to start us off. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see if I can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think a 65/35 split is a fair starting point. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is ticking and this money is losing value for me.  I'm willing to be generous, but I need you to meet me closer to the middle. 65/35 is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer ensures I get something.  Time is running out, and Alice is willing to pay a higher price for a deal."
