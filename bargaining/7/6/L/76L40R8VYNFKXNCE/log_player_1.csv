"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 5000, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split to start, and hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted to start with a fair split, but I think I deserve a bit more. Let's try again. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to negotiate a bit more in his favor. Considering the inflation, my gain of $4000 is actually worth $3200 in the first round's value. I'll have to weigh that against Bob's gain of $6000, which is worth $5400 in the first round's value.

I'll reject this offer for now and try to negotiate further.
