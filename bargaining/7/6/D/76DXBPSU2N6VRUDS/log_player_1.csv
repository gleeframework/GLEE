"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a split of $9,000 for me and $1,000 for Bob. This seems like a fair starting point, considering the potential for inflation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is significantly less than my initial proposal, the 5% inflation on my side and the 20% inflation on Bob's side make this a better deal than continuing. It's better to accept the $6,000 now than risk getting even less in future rounds."
