"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you 20% and take the rest. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than a 20/80 split.  Let's be a little more even.  This offer keeps more money in our pockets. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, my initial offer was already a bit more generous than I thought.

Considering Bob's counteroffer, I think I can do better than that. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's still a bit too uneven, Bob. I'd like to propose a more balanced split. Let's try 60/40 in my favor.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's aim for a more balanced split. I'll give you 40% and take the rest. This way, we both get a decent share.""
}
```"
