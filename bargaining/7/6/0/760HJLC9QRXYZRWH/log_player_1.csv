I'm going to start with a pretty generous offer to Bob.  I want to see if he's willing to accept a deal early on.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my strategy for the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being greedy! I'm not going to accept such an unfair deal. It's my turn to propose next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer a bit to see if Bob is willing to compromise. I'm still aiming for a good share, but I want to make sure we reach an agreement before the inflation hits us too hard."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still being very stubborn! I'm not going to accept this offer.  The money is losing value too quickly, but I'm determined to get a better deal.  It's my turn next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer even further.  Bob seems to be focused on getting a large share, so I need to make a more appealing offer to get him to accept before the inflation erodes our potential gains even more."
