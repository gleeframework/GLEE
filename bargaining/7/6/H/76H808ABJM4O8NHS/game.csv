6000.0,4000.0,"Let's start with a fair split. I get $6000, you get $4000.  It's a good deal considering the inflation!",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"I'm willing to give you a little more, but I think a 55/45 split is a fair starting point considering the inflation.",Bob,2,
,,"That's still not a great deal for me, Bob. Let's see what I can offer in the next round.",Alice,2,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Okay Bob, how about we switch it up? I'll take the $5500, and you get $4500.  The inflation is working against me, so this seems fair.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"I think it's time we compromise. The inflation is affecting both of us, and a 60/40 split feels like a fair way to move forward.",Bob,4,
,,"While I appreciate the sentiment Bob, that's the same offer I made in round one, and it's even worse for me now with the inflation.  I need to see a more significant shift in my favor to accept.",Alice,4,reject
5200.0,4800.0,"Bob, this inflation is no joke!  I'm willing to come down slightly from my previous offer, but I need you to meet me halfway.  $5200 for me and $4800 for you seems like a reasonable compromise.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
3500.0,6500.0,"Alice, the inflation is hitting us both hard, but I'm trying to be fair. Let's meet in the middle. I'll take 65% and you take 35%. This is a good deal for both of us considering the circumstances.",Bob,6,
,,"Bob, I understand the inflation affects us both, but your idea of 'meeting in the middle' seems very generous to yourself. This offer is significantly worse than what you've offered before. I'm starting to worry we won't reach an agreement.",Alice,6,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  We need to settle this before the inflation eats away at everything. Let's split it right down the middle, 50/50.  It's the fairest option at this point, and we both need to agree before we lose it all.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,accept
