"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""
}
```

I'm proposing that I take $6,000 and Bob takes $4,000, with a message suggesting a fair split. Waiting for Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split, considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{

  ""alice_gain"": 5700,
  ""bob_gain"": 4300,
  ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I've made a compromise""
}

I've taken into account the 5% decrease in value for my share from Round 1 to Round 2, and another 5% decrease from Round 2 to Round 3, and adjusted my proposal accordingly. Waiting for Bob's response!"
