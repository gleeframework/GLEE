"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 650000,
""bob_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Let's be fair, Bob. This offer gets us both a good amount."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Strong:**  It's generally good to begin negotiations with a somewhat ambitious offer. This signals that I value my position.
* **Understanding Inflation:**  Time is literally money in this game. I lose value faster than Bob with each round.  A slightly less favorable offer now is better than risking a much worse outcome later. 
* **Appearing Reasonable:** While my offer favors me, it's not outrageously so. I want to give Bob an incentive to accept, emphasizing fairness and a win-win situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be realistic. I'm willing to give you a generous share, but I deserve a larger cut. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's message sounds generous, the actual offer is heavily skewed in his favor. The impact of inflation makes accepting this deal much worse for me than it appears at face value. 

* **My Loss:** Accepting this offer means I'm getting 400,000, which is already less than what I initially proposed. Due to inflation, this amount is worth even less to me now.
* **Bob's Advantage:** Bob is essentially offering me a slightly better deal than last round, knowing that the longer the game goes on, the more desperate I'll become for any deal. 

I need to counter with a proposal that acknowledges the inflation but doesn't drastically undervalue my position."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Bob, time is literally money for us, and we're both losing out. This offer is a compromise that still gets us a good deal."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Time Pressure:** I'm making it clear to Bob that I understand the impact of inflation on both of us. Delaying a decision benefits neither of us. 
* **Compromise, Not Capitulation:**  While my offer is lower than my initial proposal, it's significantly better than what Bob offered. I'm showing flexibility but not caving to his unrealistic expectations.
* **Focusing on the Shared Goal:** Reminding Bob that the goal is for both of us to walk away with a ""good deal"" keeps the negotiation collaborative rather than adversarial."
