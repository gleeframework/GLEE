"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and start fresh""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'm not being generous 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Since my gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll have to think carefully about whether it's worth accepting.

For now, I'll decide to...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was quite one-sided, I'll try to make a more balanced proposal this time. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""A bit more generous this time, but I'm still trying to get a fair deal""}

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share this time, but I'm still trying to maintain a reasonable balance. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
