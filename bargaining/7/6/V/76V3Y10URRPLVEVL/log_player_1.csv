"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. This ensures a large initial gain and gives Bob some incentive to consider accepting. Since inflation is a factor, I want to maximize my share early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While this offer seems good on the surface, I'm going to reject it. Here's why:

* **Inflation Advantage:** I know that the money I gain is worth the same as the previous round.  However, Bob is experiencing a 20% reduction in the value of his gains due to inflation. This means that in future rounds, the value of my gains will likely stay the same, while his will continue to decrease.
* **Power Dynamics:** By rejecting this offer, I maintain control of the negotiation. I'm not desperate to accept a small share, and I'm confident that I can secure a better deal later in the game.

By rejecting now, I create pressure on Bob. He'll likely need to make a more appealing offer in the next round to avoid losing more ground due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm going to slightly reduce my share to 80%, giving Bob 20%.  My reasoning:

* **Maintaining Control:** By offering a smaller share than my previous offer, I show that I'm not desperate and am willing to walk away. This creates pressure on Bob to accept or offer something more favorable.
* **Inflation Advantage:** Since inflation is affecting Bob more than me, the value of his gains will continue to decrease with each passing round. Offering a slightly higher share now may be more appealing to him than waiting and potentially getting even less later.
* **Strategic Compromise:** This is a compromise that allows me to secure a good share of the money while keeping the door open for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I am going to reject Bob's offer. While it seems tempting at first, the inflation is working in my favor:

* **Inflation Advantage:** Bob is facing a massive 48.8% reduction in the value of his gains, while my gains remain unaffected. This means that with every passing round, the value of my gains becomes more significant in comparison to his.
* **Power Dynamics:** By rejecting his offer, I continue to hold the power in the negotiation. He is desperate to secure a deal as his gains are rapidly diminishing. I can leverage this desperation to push for a more favorable deal in future rounds.
* **Future Potential:** The value of my gains will likely increase with each passing round due to Bob's dwindling gains. Holding out now gives me a better chance of securing a larger share in the future.

By rejecting his offer, I am pushing the negotiation in my favor. It is very likely that Bob will be forced to offer me a much better deal in the next round to avoid losing even more ground due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly to 70%, giving Bob 30%. Here's why:

* **Inflation Advantage:** Bob is losing a significant amount of value with each passing round due to inflation.  I need to offer something enticing enough to tempt him, but not so much that I lose out on the benefits of inflation.
* **Shifting Power Dynamics:**  I'm starting to see a shift in the power dynamic. Bob is increasingly desperate, and my rejection of his last offer has likely amplified that. 
* **Strategic Approach:** By offering a slight increase, I'm testing the waters. If he rejects this, it confirms that I need to hold out for a better deal. If he accepts, I've secured a good share while still taking advantage of the inflation situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's getting closer to a 50/50 split, I'm still not satisfied. Here's why:

* **Inflation Advantage:** Bob is now losing over 67% of the value of his gains due to inflation.  This means that each round, the value of my share becomes increasingly more significant. I don't need to rush into a deal that doesn't fully reflect the current advantage I have.
* **Power Dynamics:** Bob's increasing desperation is a clear sign that he's willing to concede more ground.  By rejecting his offer, I'm reinforcing my position and putting pressure on him to make a more generous proposal in the next round.
* **Future Potential:** With each round, the value of my share is likely to increase further as Bob's share diminishes.  I'm confident that if I hold out, I can secure a much more favorable deal in the remaining rounds.

This offer is a step in the right direction, but I'm holding out for a better outcome. I'm confident that with a few more rounds of negotiation, I can get a larger share of the money, leveraging the power of inflation to my advantage."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35}
```

I'm offering 65% for myself and 35% for Bob. My reasoning:

* **Inflation Advantage:**  Bob is losing a substantial amount of value due to inflation.  He needs to secure a deal quickly to minimize his losses.
* **Shifting Power Dynamics:** The power balance continues to shift in my favor.  My previous rejections have likely made Bob more desperate, and he is likely to be more open to my offer.
* **Strategic Compromise:** This offer is a compromise, but it still gives me a substantial portion of the money while acknowledging Bob's need for a deal.

I believe this offer is compelling enough to persuade Bob to accept, as it gives him a larger share than his previous offer. However, if he rejects, I will continue to push for a larger portion in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's getting closer to a 50/50 split, I'm still not satisfied. Here's why:

* **Inflation Advantage:** Bob is now losing over 79% of the value of his gains due to inflation.  This means that each round, the value of my share becomes increasingly more significant. I don't need to rush into a deal that doesn't fully reflect the current advantage I have.

This offer is a step in the right direction, but I'm holding out for a better outcome. I'm confident that with a few more rounds of negotiation, I can get a larger share of the money, leveraging the power of inflation to my advantage."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}
```

I'm offering 75% for myself and 25% for Bob. My reasoning:

* **Inflation Advantage:**  The value of Bob's gains is rapidly declining due to inflation, making him increasingly desperate to secure a deal.
* **Power Dynamics:**  I've successfully rejected several of his offers, demonstrating that I'm not afraid to walk away. This gives me a strong negotiating position.
* **Strategic Calculation:** This offer is a significant increase from my previous offer, showing that I am willing to compromise. However, it still gives me a substantial share of the money, considering Bob's diminishing gains.

This offer is a fair compromise, leveraging my advantage while considering Bob's situation. If he rejects it, I'm prepared to continue pushing for a larger share in the remaining rounds."
