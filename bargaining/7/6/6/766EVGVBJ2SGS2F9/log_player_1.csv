"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 50/50.""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a fair split, 50/50, and see how Bob responds. Since there's no inflation in the first round, we can consider this a baseline offer. I'm curious to see if Bob will accept or try to negotiate for more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer of a 50/50 split, but I think I can provide more value in this scenario. How about a 60/40 split? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money is worth 20% less for me in this round, I need to consider the reduced value. With Bob's offer of a 60/40 split, I would get $4000, which is equivalent to $3200 in the first round's value (due to the 20% decrease). Considering this, I think I can try to negotiate for a better deal in the next round. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal.
{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nNow it's my turn again. I'll make a new offer and try to find a mutually beneficial agreement. Since the money is worth less to me, I might need to be more strategic in my proposal.
###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to offer a 55/45 split. This way, we both get a decent share, and I account for the reduced value on my end.""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nSince I've already made my new offer in the previous response, I'll just reiterate it here.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the inflation concern, but a 55/45 split still feels a bit too low for me.  I propose a 58/42 split as a middle ground. It's a stronger position for me while still offering you a reasonable amount considering the time pressure. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 48.8% less for me in this round, I need to carefully evaluate Bob's offer. The proposed 58/42 split would give me $4200, which, considering the inflation, is equivalent to approximately $2151 in the first round's value. Given the decreasing value of the money for me, I'm not satisfied with this offer. I think I can try to negotiate for a better deal in the next round, hoping to find a more favorable split. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal.
{""decision"": ""reject""}
###\n\nNow it's my turn again. Considering the significant decrease in value due to inflation, I need to adjust my strategy to ensure I get a reasonable share.
###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Given the substantial impact of inflation on my end, I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. This adjustment accounts for the loss in value I'm experiencing, while still offering you a considerable amount.""}\n\n###\n\nI'm trying to compensate for the loss in value by proposing a split that favors me slightly more, while still being mindful of Bob's expectations. Let's see how Bob responds to this new offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I've already made my new offer in the previous response, I'll just reiterate it here.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the inflation is a major factor now.  This offer is my final compromise - it gives me a slight edge while still leaving you with a significant sum considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 67.23% less for me in this round, the impact of inflation is severe. Bob's offer of a 55/45 split in his favor would give me $4500, which, considering the inflation, is equivalent to approximately $1477 in the first round's value. Given the drastic decrease in value, I'm not thrilled with this offer, but I also need to consider the time pressure and the risk of ending up with nothing if we don't reach an agreement within the 12 rounds. I'll have to weigh my options carefully.
