Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I still want the bigger share 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable. I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need a decent share too. This is getting risky with the inflation.""}

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll meet you halfway between my last offer and your last offer. This is my final compromise 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

At this point, inflation is becoming very significant, and the potential gains are shrinking rapidly.  Accepting this offer is the best way to ensure some gain, even though it's not a perfect split."
