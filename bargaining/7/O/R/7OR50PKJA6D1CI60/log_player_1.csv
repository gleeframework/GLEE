Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my opening offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or proceed to the next round."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

I'm offering a slightly more favorable split to Bob this time, but still aiming to get a larger share for myself."
