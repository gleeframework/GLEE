Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fairer. Let's start with this and see where we go from here.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's split it evenly, and we both get a decent amount before the money gets too small. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to a more reasonable split, accepting now would mean I'm losing out significantly to inflation. I need to push for a slightly better deal while there's still time, but I need to be mindful that the pot is shrinking for both of us."
