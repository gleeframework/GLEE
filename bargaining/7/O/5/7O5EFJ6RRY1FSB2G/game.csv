5250.0,4750.0,"Let's split fairly, with a slight advantage for me starting off.  Every round the total amount decreases, so it's in our best interest to settle this quickly.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Let's split it evenly, we both get 5000. The money is worth 5% less to me now, so I'm actually getting less value than you. It's fair to split it 50/50.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5200.0,4800.0,"Bob, I understand the inflation is affecting you, but I need a bit more to make this worthwhile. This offer is still better than what you'll get in later rounds.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4950.0,5050.0,"Considering the inflation, I'm willing to take a bit more to offset the loss. This way, we both still get a significant amount, and it's better to settle now rather than losing more value in the next rounds.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5100.0,4900.0,"Bob, we're running out of time, and the value is only decreasing for you. This is a compromise - I'm lowering my share, but we need to agree now before you lose even more.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
4925.0,5075.0,"Time is of the essence! With the inflation eating away at my share, I'm willing to take a bit more to offset the loss. This is a fair offer, considering the circumstances. Let's settle this now before it's too late!",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
5050.0,4950.0,"Bob, this is it.  I'm coming down to an even 50/50 split to get this done. You are losing value with every second that passes! If you reject this, I'm afraid we'll both walk away with nothing.",Alice,7,
