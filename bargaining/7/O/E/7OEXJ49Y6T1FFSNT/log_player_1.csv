"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, see how it goes from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this fair offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a better deal this time, but you have to take it! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to negotiate, but at a cost to me. With inflation, my gain of $3000 is now worth 95% of what it was in the first round, which is $2850. Bob's gain of $7000 is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, which is $6300.

Considering this, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject Bob's offer. Since my gain is significantly lower than Bob's, I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Now it's my turn again. Since the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm still hoping for a fair split.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but still trying to maintain a fair division of the remaining $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer to a fair split, but I'm not there yet! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation:

My gain of $4000 is worth 86.74% of the original $5000, which is approximately $4340.

Bob's gain of $6000 is worth 72.9% of the original $8300, which is approximately $6000.

Considering the values, I'll decide whether to accept or reject Bob's offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
