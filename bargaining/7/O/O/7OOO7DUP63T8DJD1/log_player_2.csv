Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of Bob's shrinking pot. While the difference is getting smaller, accepting now would still mean losing out on a significant sum compared to the initial rounds. Bob needs to hold his ground a bit longer and hope Alice starts making real concessions."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""This is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the fairest. Take it or leave it, Alice.""}

**Reasoning:**

It's time for a power play.  Delaying further significantly hurts Bob due to inflation. A firm 50/50 offer:

* **Projects strength:**  Alice might be trying to exploit Bob's weakening position. A firm stance shows he's not desperate.
* **Is simple and fair:**  Hard to argue against, and Alice might be more agreeable as the deadline approaches.
* **Establishes a clear bottom line:**  Alice knows now that getting more than half is off the table.

There's a risk Alice will reject it, but the potential loss from further inflation makes it a gamble worth taking."
