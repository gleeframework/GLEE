"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering a fair split. Let's get this over with quickly. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's split it with a slight bias to me, considering the inflation rate is higher for you.""}\n\n###\n\nI'm making an offer that takes into account the inflation rates, trying to find a middle ground that might appeal to Alice given her higher inflation rate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable. This inflation is making things worse for both of us, let's split it evenly this time. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the impact of inflation on both of our gains and the fact that Alice is now offering an even split, it seems like the best option to accept this offer before the value of the money decreases further."
