Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're running out of time, Bob.  I need to factor in the inflation hitting me each round. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200

``` 

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in Round 5 is the most logical choice for Bob at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is steadily decreasing for Alice, making her more likely to accept a deal as time goes on. However, this doesn't affect Bob.
* **Time Pressure:** Alice states this is her final offer, increasing the pressure. If Bob rejects this, there's a high chance the negotiations fail, and they both get nothing. 
* **Decent Offer:** While not the 51/49 split Bob aimed for, getting $4800 is still a significant sum. 

Rejecting this offer carries a substantial risk for Bob with little potential reward."
