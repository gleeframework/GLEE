Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 900,000 - 100,000 split in my favor. I'm hoping Bob will find this a fair offer, considering the potential for inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I would have preferred a larger share, the inflation risk is high. Accepting this 50/50 split guarantees me at least half of what I could have gotten in the first round, after accounting for inflation."
