"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and get it over with.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do a little better than a 50/50 split. Let's start with 60/40 and see where we can go from there. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll consider the effective value of the offer. In terms of the initial $1,000,000, my gain of $400,000 is equivalent to $380,000 in the first round.

I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I think it's a reasonable offer. I'll decide to...
