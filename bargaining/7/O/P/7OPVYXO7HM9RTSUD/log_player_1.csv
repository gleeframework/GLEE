"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly considering the inflation impact""}\n\nI'd like to propose a division where I receive $6000 and Bob receives $4000. Given the inflation impact, where each round decreases the value of money by 20% for me and 10% for Bob, starting with a higher share seems reasonable to account for the greater depreciation on my side. This initial offer aims to balance the future loss in value, making it a fair starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair, considering the inflation impact is greater on you. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nGiven the current offer and the impact of inflation, accepting this split would mean I end up with significantly less value compared to the original amount. Since the money is worth 20% less for me in this round, the $4000 offered is actually worth $3200 in terms of original value, which is too low for me to accept. I'll proceed to the next round to try and negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the progressive devaluation of money due to inflation, where each round further reduces the value, it's crucial to adjust the proposal to reflect this changing value. Given that I'm now facing a second round of 20% depreciation, and Bob faces a second round of 10% depreciation, the stakes for maintaining value are higher for me.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Adjusting for increased inflation impact, let's find a mutually beneficial split""}\n\nThis offer aims to slightly increase Bob's share while ensuring that I mitigate the loss due to inflation. By proposing a division of $5800 for myself and $4200 for Bob, I'm attempting to find a middle ground that acknowledges the impact of inflation on both of us, while also recognizing the need for compromise to reach an agreement."
