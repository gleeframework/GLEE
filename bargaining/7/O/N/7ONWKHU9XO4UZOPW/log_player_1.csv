Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose that I take $90 and Bob takes $10.  It seems like a fair starting point, as I am the one initiating the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
