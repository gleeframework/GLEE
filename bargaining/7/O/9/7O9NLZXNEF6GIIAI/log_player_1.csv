"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70/30 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet in the middle, let's see if you're willing to compromise! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, my gain of 50 is actually equivalent to 40 in the first round. I'm not sure if I'm willing to meet in the middle, considering I could have gotten 70 in the first round. However, I'm willing to compromise.
