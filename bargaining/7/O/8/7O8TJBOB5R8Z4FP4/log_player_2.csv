"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split almost evenly, with a slight advantage for me to account for inflation in later rounds.  This way we both benefit greatly. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I think this offer is too generous to Alice. I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I think a more balanced split is fair.  This will give me a slightly better deal, but still leave you with a significant portion. Let's get this done before inflation bites us both!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. Inflation is working against me. I'm proposing a perfectly even split. Take it or leave it - time is literally money for me. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
An even split is fair given the current circumstances. I'm happy to secure half the money before inflation hurts us both further."
