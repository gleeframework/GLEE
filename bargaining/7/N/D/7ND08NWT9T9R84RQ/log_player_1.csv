"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $10,000, which is $8,000, and Bob gets $2,000. This is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly bigger share 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $6,000 is worth 80% of $8,000, which is $6,400, and Bob's gain of $4,000 is worth 80% of $2,000, which is $3,200.

I don't think this offer is a good compromise, as I'm giving up more than I gained in the first round. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, my gain of $6,400 is now worth 80% of $6,400, which is $5,120, and Bob's gain of $3,200 is now worth 80% of $3,200, which is $2,560.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I still want a majority share""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the remaining $10,000, which is $7,000, and Bob gets $3,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, let's split it 50/50 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less in each round, the total reduction in value is 1.2^3 = 1.728, or 72.8%. So, my gain of $7,000 is now worth 27.2% of the original $10,000, which is $2,720.

Bob's gain of $3,000 is now worth 30% of the original $10,000, which is $3,000.

Bob's offer is to split the remaining $10,000 50/50, which is a fair offer considering the current value of the money. I'll accept this offer.
