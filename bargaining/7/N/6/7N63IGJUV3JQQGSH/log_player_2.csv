Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see we're getting closer. I'll meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. 58-42 is a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. The inflation is starting to become significant, but it's more important to secure a better deal.  I'm aiming for something closer to a 50/50 split, and I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to achieve that."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're getting anxious, but I'm not ready to settle for 52% yet. How about we meet at 56-44? It's a fair deal considering the time left. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The game has reached a critical point.  

* **Significant Inflation:**  The money is losing value rapidly. Accepting 440,000 now is significantly better than potentially getting a slightly better deal in a few rounds and losing even more to inflation.
* **Alice's Concessions:**  Alice has moved considerably from her initial 60/40 offer. While not ideal, 56/44 is likely the best I can realistically achieve at this stage.
* **Risk of Losing Everything:** Holding out any longer significantly increases the risk of walking away with nothing. 

It's a tough decision, but the risk of getting a much worse outcome outweighs the potential for a slightly higher gain."
