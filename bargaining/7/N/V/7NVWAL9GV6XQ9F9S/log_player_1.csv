I propose to take almost all of the money and give Bob only $1. This is a very aggressive strategy, but I hope Bob will realize that getting anything is better than nothing if he rejects my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer. While it's a lot of money, I am hoping to get a better deal in the next round. I know Bob will have to make a more favorable offer to me because my share will be worth more in the next round due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering Bob a 400,000 share, which is a significant increase from his last offer.  I'm hoping this will be more appealing to him, considering the increasing value of my share due to inflation."
