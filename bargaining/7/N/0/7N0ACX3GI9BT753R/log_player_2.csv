Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's offer was 50/50, I'll try to get a bit more. Given the inflation factor, I'll offer a slight increase to Alice's share. Here's my offer:

# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer is still slightly biased towards her. I'll try to get a bit more, but not too much, since I don't want to risk rejection again. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's offer was 45/55, I'll try to get closer to 50/50. Given the inflation factor, I'll offer a slight increase to my share. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 47,
""alice_gain"": 53}"
