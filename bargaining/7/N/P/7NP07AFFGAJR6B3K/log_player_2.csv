"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money equally. It's fair and simple. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

It's tempting to take the easy split, but there's no harm in seeing what Alice will offer next, especially since I know the money is worth less with each round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm confident I can get a better deal for myself in the long run.  Let's see if you agree!""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we divide the money with a slight imbalance, hoping to balance our gains over time. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Alice's offer is better than the previous round's offer, it's still significantly less than what I could get in the first round.  I'm hoping to leverage the inflation factor in my favor and get a better deal in the coming rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""We're both losing money with each round. I'm willing to offer you a slightly larger share this time to show my willingness to compromise.  Let's try to find a deal that works for both of us.""
}

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I believe a more balanced division could work better for both of us. This time, I've tried to keep it closer to an even split. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is getting closer to what I was hoping for in the first round, but I still think I can get a better deal.  I'm going to keep playing and see if I can push for a higher share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 7000,
""alice_gain"": 3000,
""message"": ""The inflation is hurting us both, but I think we can still find a way to both get a decent share. I'm willing to offer you a smaller share this time, but I believe it's a good deal considering how much the money is worth now. Let's try to reach an agreement.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: After considering the impact of inflation, I believe it's best to split the money equally again. This maintains fairness and ensures stability in our shares. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Alice's offer is now better than what I initially asked for in the first round. While inflation has definitely eaten away at the value of the money, accepting this offer guarantees me a substantial share and avoids the risk of getting nothing at all in the later rounds."
