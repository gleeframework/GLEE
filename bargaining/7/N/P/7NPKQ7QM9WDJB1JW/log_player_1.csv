"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly considering the inflation impact.""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering $5,500 for myself and $4,500 for Bob, with a message suggesting a fair split considering the inflation impact. Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the inflation puts you at a disadvantage, but my offer in this round ensures you get a decent share before it diminishes further. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer. Although the offer seems generous given the message, accepting $4,000 in the second round means I'd actually be getting less value due to the 20% decrease from the first round. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to get a better deal despite the decreasing value."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Considering the rapid value loss for me, I need a larger share.""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering $6,000 for myself and $4,000 for Bob, with a message explaining that due to the rapid loss of value on my end, I need a larger share to compensate for the inflation impact. Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer.  Take it or leave it.  The value for both of us decreases each round. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI'm accepting Bob's offer. Given that the value of the money for me decreases by 20% each round and we're already in the fourth round, the value has decreased significantly. Accepting $4,500 now is better than risking another round where the value would decrease further. Additionally, Bob's message indicates this is his final offer, suggesting he might not be willing to compromise further. It's time to secure what I can."
