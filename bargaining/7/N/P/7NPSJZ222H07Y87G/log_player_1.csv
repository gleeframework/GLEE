"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, I'll consider the actual value of the money I'll get if I accept this offer. 55% of the remaining money (after inflation) is worth 44% of the initial $100. Similarly, Bob will get 45% of the remaining money, which is worth 42.5% of the initial $100.

Considering the reduced value of the money, I think this offer is not bad. I'll accept Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
