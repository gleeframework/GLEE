"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. I'll give you a decent amount.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 30 dollars, which is a relatively small amount, to see if he'll accept and end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll match your fairness, but let's not leave room for negotiations 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 10% less, so I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the 50 dollars, which is a fair split, and we can end the game."
