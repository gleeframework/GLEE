Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very lopsided offer. I'm hoping that Bob will realize that he has much more to gain by accepting even a small amount now, rather than risking getting nothing if we go through all 12 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to keep more of the money, it's better to take the 500,000 now than risk getting nothing in the next 10 rounds.  There's no guarantee Bob will be so generous again, and the inflation could eat away at my share significantly."
