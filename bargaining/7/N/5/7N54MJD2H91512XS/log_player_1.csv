"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting 6,000 and Bob getting 4,000. This is a reasonable starting point, and I hope Bob will consider it a fair offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting a smaller share, but it's still a decent offer. Accept now and avoid further negotiations. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 2,000 offer, but I'm also concerned about the potential consequences of further negotiations and the decreasing value of the money due to inflation.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
