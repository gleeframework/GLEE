I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor. It's a pretty aggressive offer, but I figure I can get away with it since the inflation rate is a secret. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob's offer is a lot worse than my initial proposal. I'm not going to accept that. Let's see what I can do in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I'll offer a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a more reasonable offer, and I think it's a good compromise after Bob's lowball offer. Let's see if he's willing to accept this time."
