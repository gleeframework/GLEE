50.0,50.0,Let's start fair.  I propose a 50/50 split.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
40.0,60.0,"Your 50/50 split seems fair at first glance, but the inflation hurts you more than me. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor to account for this difference. Consider it carefully - the longer we wait, the less we both get!",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"I understand the inflation, but a 60/40 split is too much. Let's compromise with a 55/45 split. This still accounts for the inflation, but it's fairer to both of us.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
42.0,58.0,"I appreciate the attempt at compromise, but we're running out of time. 58/42 is my final offer for this round. It accounts for the inflation we face, and we both need to agree before our potential gains dwindle further.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
52.0,48.0,"I'm willing to meet you halfway. 52/48 is my final offer for this round.  We can't keep going back and forth, the longer we wait the less we both get!",Alice,5,
