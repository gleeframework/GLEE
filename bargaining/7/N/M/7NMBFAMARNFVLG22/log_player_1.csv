"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, a fair deal!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split, where I get 80% of the money and Bob gets 20%. I think this is a fair deal, considering the initial amount is $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slightly more balanced split, but still a good deal for me 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I can see that Bob's offer is more generous than his initial proposal.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
