"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice.  A 50/50 split seems like the best way to start.  I'm sure we can find a better deal later, but let's see how this goes first. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
