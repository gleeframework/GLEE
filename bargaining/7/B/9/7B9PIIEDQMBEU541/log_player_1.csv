"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money 60-40, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me $6,000 and Bob $4,000. This is a relatively generous offer, considering I'm the first one to make a proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's see if we can do better 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, Bob's offer is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so he's effectively offering me $4,500 and keeping $4,500 for himself.

I'll consider this offer. Since it's a 50-50 split, it's a fair offer, but I was hoping to get a better deal. However, I don't want to risk going to the next round and facing even more inflation.

I'll accept this offer.
