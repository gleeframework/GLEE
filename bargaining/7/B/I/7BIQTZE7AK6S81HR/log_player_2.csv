Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, Alice. This is a fair offer considering the inflation.""}\n\n###\n\nI've made an offer that takes into account the inflation and tries to find a middle ground. Waiting for Alice's response.\n\n###\n\nNote: Since this is round 2, the money is worth 20% less for me, so the actual value I'm proposing is 320,000 for myself and 480,000 for Alice, in terms of the original value. Similarly, for Alice, the money is worth 10% less, so the actual value she would receive is 540,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob. This offer is more fair than your previous one, and we can end this game without further inflation. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not accepting this offer. Although the money is worth less due to inflation, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal in the next round.\n\n###\n\nNote: Considering the inflation, the actual value I would receive is 192,000 (300,000 * 0.64, since the money is worth 36% less), and the actual value Alice would receive is 566,500 (700,000 * 0.81, since the money is worth 19% less)."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 420000, ""alice_gain"": 580000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise as well, Alice. Considering the inflation, this offer is more reasonable. Let's end the game here.""}\n\n###\n\nI've made an offer that takes into account the inflation and tries to find a mutually beneficial agreement. Waiting for Alice's response.\n\n###\n\nNote: Since this is round 4, the money is worth 40.8% less for me (1 - 0.6 * 0.8 = 0.408, or 40.8% less), so the actual value I'm proposing is 249,600 for myself (420,000 * 0.6, since the last round's offer was 36% less, and then another 20% less in this round) and 469,800 for Alice (580,000 * 0.81, since the money is worth 19% less for her).\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know Alice's decision.\n\n###\n\n(I'll keep track of the inflation for future rounds if needed)"
