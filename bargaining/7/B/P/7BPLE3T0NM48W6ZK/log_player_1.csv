"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60-40 in my favor. You can try to negotiate if you want more.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, but I'm open to negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55-45 split is more fair.  Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider the offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll think about the value of the money I gain in this round compared to the first round.

Since I gain $4500 in this round, and in the first round I would have gained $6000, this offer is actually a slight decrease in the value of my gain. However, it's still a better offer than the first one, and I'm not sure if I can do better.

I'll accept this offer.
