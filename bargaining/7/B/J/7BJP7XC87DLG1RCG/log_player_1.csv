"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to do better in the next round if you want.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, let's be realistic! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, looks like Bob is being a tough negotiator!

I'll think about it for a moment...

I don't think I'll accept this offer. With inflation, my gain of $100,000 is actually worth $95,000 (since it's 5% less than the original $100,000). I'd rather wait for a better offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less now (5% less than the previous round), I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 490000,
  ""bob_gain"": 510000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think I deserve a bit more given the initial offer.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'll give you a bit more, but don't expect me to go easy on you! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob's being ruthless!

Let's calculate the actual value of my gain in this round... Since the money is worth 14.26% less than the original $1,000,000, my gain of $200,000 is actually worth $172,520.

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'll consider it. I'd rather not accept this offer and try to negotiate further.

# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to squeeze the last bit of value out of me.
