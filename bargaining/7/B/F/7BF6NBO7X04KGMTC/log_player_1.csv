This is a tough one! While Bob's offer is far from ideal, it's important to consider the situation strategically:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is decreasing significantly with each round for me (Alice), but not for Bob. 
* **Downward Trend:** Bob's offers have been getting progressively worse from my perspective.
* **Potential for Losing More:**  If I reject this offer, there's a high chance Bob will offer me even less in the next round, which would be further eroded by inflation. 

Therefore, even though it's not a ""fair"" deal, accepting Bob's offer of $4000 is the most logical choice at this point to avoid losing even more money to inflation."
