# Alice gain: 40

Do you accept this offer?","I'm not convinced by Bob's argument, and I think I can do better. I'll reject his offer and propose a new one.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly better deal.""}

# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'm running out of time and options. I'll accept his offer, hoping that I can still get a better deal in the next round.
