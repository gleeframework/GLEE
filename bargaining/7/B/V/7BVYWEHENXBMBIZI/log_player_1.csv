Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering the inflation rate is higher for me. Let's see what you think. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not convinced by Bob's offer. I was willing to start with a 60-40 split, but now he's trying to take an even bigger share. I think I can do better than this. I'll wait for the next round to make a new proposal."
