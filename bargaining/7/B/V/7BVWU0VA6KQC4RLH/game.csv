6000.0,4000.0,Let's split the money 60/40. This ensures you get a fair share while I get slightly more for starting the negotiations. It's a good deal for both of us before inflation diminishes the value.,Alice,1,

4500.0,5500.0,"Your offer was a bit too skewed in your favor, Alice. Let's be fair, I take a slightly larger share this round acknowledging that you initiated the negotiation.  This way we both benefit before inflation eats away at the value.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5200.0,4800.0,"Bob, I understand you want a larger share, but letting inflation eat away at the value benefits neither of us. I'm proposing a 52/48 split - closer to your offer, but still recognizing my initial proposal. Let's close the deal before we lose more.",Alice,3,
