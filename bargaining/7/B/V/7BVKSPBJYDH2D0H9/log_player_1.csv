"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}

This way, I get 70% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob gets 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll have to be more cautious. Since Bob's offer is closer to my desired share, I'll decide to accept this offer.
