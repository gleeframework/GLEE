I'm starting with a pretty aggressive offer, aiming for the majority of the money. Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

While I'd prefer to keep a larger share, taking a 50/50 split is still a good outcome considering the inflation.  It's better to secure something now than risk getting less in future rounds."
