"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer, Bob! I'll take 100% and you get nothing. But don't worry, I'm sure you'll do better next round.""
}
```

This offer is a bit cheeky, but I'm hoping Bob will see the humor in it and make a counteroffer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle, Alice. Fair and square! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to consider the effects of inflation. Since the money is worth 5% less for me, I'll think about the actual value I'll get.

For me, the gain of 40$ is actually 40 * 0.95 = 38$ in real value.

I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer or not.

I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me, I'll make an offer that takes this into account. I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the decreasing value of money.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, Bob, but I think this is a fair compromise. Don't wait too long to respond, though!""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will see the value in this offer and accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going to get taken advantage of, Alice. Let's meet in the middle, but this time for real. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the increased inflation, the money is worth less and less for me.

For me, the gain of 50$ is actually 50 * 0.8574 = 42.87$ in real value.

I'm not sure if this is the best I can get, but I'll consider it. Since the inflation is affecting me more severely, I'll think about whether I can do better next round.

I'll accept this offer.
