"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we both get $5,000 each. This seems like a reasonable starting point, and I hope Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take this! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too thrilled about Bob's proposal, but I'll consider it.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll evaluate the offer based on the current value. Bob's proposal would give me $4,000, which is a significant decrease from the original $5,000 I proposed.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more""}

I'm proposing a slightly more favorable split, giving me $5,500 and Bob $4,500. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in this compromise and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I still want more! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

Considering the inflation, Bob's proposal would give me $4,500, which is still a decrease from my original $5,000. However, I'm getting closer to the middle ground.

I'll think carefully about this offer. If I accept, I'll be giving up $500 from my original proposal. On the other hand, if I reject and Bob makes another offer, the value of the money will decrease even further.

I'll accept this offer, hoping that Bob will be more willing to compromise in future rounds.
