"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit too greedy for me.  Let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. Think about it - it's better to secure a decent amount now than risk getting even less later as inflation kicks in. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
