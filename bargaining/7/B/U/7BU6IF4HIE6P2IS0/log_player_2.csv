"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  We can work from there. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nReasoning: In this game, I (Bob) am at a disadvantage due to inflation, as each round decreases the value of the money by 10% for me and 20% for Alice. However, starting with a 60/40 split in Alice's favor seems unfair since we both have equal bargaining power at the start. Rejecting the first offer gives me a chance to propose a more favorable division in the next round or potentially force Alice into a worse position due to the higher inflation rate affecting her share. Given the early stage of the game and the significant impact of inflation, especially on Alice, it's strategic to reject the offer and see how the game unfolds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's try a bit more balanced approach considering the inflation impact.""}\n\nReasoning: Given the inflation rates (10% for me and 20% for Alice), and considering we are in the early stages of the game, I propose a division that slightly favors me. This is strategic because, with each passing round, Alice loses more value than I do. By offering a 55/45 split, I'm testing Alice's willingness to negotiate while also taking into account the future devaluation of the money, especially on her part. This approach aims to find a middle ground while leveraging the pressure of inflation to my advantage."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly.  Inflation is hurting us both, so a 50/50 split seems fairest now. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nReasoning: Although a 50/50 split might seem fair under normal circumstances, considering the impact of inflation, Alice is actually losing more value over time compared to me. Given that we are only in Round 3 and there are 9 rounds left, accepting a 50/50 split now might not maximize my gain, especially since Alice is under more pressure due to her higher inflation rate. By rejecting this offer, I aim to leverage the increasing pressure of inflation on Alice to potentially secure a better deal in future rounds. Additionally, since the money's value decreases more significantly for Alice, she might be more inclined to accept a less favorable offer in subsequent rounds rather than risking further devaluation of her potential gain."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering the impact of inflation, I'm willing to take a bit more but still offer you a substantial amount.""}\n\nReasoning: In this round, I'm increasing my proposed share slightly, taking into account the cumulative effect of inflation on both of us but particularly on Alice. Given that Alice's potential gain is devaluing faster than mine, I'm positioning myself to benefit from this dynamic while still offering her a significant amount. This strategy aims to test Alice's patience and her willingness to accept a deal that is slightly less favorable to her but still reasonable, considering the ongoing devaluation of the money. By proposing a 58/42 split, I'm applying gentle pressure while keeping the door open for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're both losing money with each round. Let's compromise and try a 45/55 split in your favor.  I think that's the best we can do at this point. 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nReasoning: Given the current state of the game and the significant impact of inflation on both our potential gains, accepting a 45/55 split in my favor seems like the most strategic decision. At this point, we've both lost considerable value due to inflation, but Alice is losing value at a much higher rate. Her offer indicates a willingness to compromise and possibly a concern about ending up with nothing if we continue. Since the difference in our inflation rates means I'm in a slightly better position, but still losing value, securing a deal now minimizes further loss. Accepting this offer ensures I receive a larger share that is still worth a substantial amount compared to waiting longer, where both of us risk ending up with significantly less or even nothing if we fail to reach an agreement within the 12 rounds."
