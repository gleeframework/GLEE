"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This way, I get 80% of the initial $10,000, and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll evaluate Bob's offer. Since the money is worth less, I'd rather get a larger share to compensate for the decrease. However, Bob's offer is still quite generous, and I don't want to risk waiting for a better offer.
