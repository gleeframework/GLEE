"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60/40.  It's a fair start, and we can both walk away with a decent amount.

# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see if we can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think we can do better. I'm offering you 4000, and I'll take 6000. It's a fair deal, and we can end this game quickly.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise.  Let's split it 55/45. This is a fair deal, and we can finally end this game. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a 60/40 split, the inflation is eating into my potential gains. Accepting this offer ensures I get something and avoids further losses."
