"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's share fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a 60-40 split in my favor. Since the money loses value over rounds, I want to incentivize Bob to accept the offer early on. A ""fair"" offer might be subjective, but starting with a slight bias towards myself gives room for negotiation while still being somewhat reasonable. Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a more fair split, considering the potential for inflation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI won't accept this offer because, despite the inflation, giving Bob 60% of the money seems too skewed in his favor. The difference in how inflation affects us means I lose more value over time, but accepting such a low offer now doesn't feel right. I'll propose a counteroffer, aiming for a more balanced split, considering the inflation impact. Let's see how Bob responds to a different proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet closer to the middle.""}\n\n###\n\nGiven the impact of inflation and the need to find a mutually acceptable split, I'm adjusting my offer to give myself 55% and Bob 45%. This is a compromise, taking into account the value loss over rounds, especially since I'm more affected by it. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a reasonable middle ground, considering the pressures of inflation on both our parts."
