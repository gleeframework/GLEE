"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1} 
```

I'm going to start with a very unequal offer, but I think it's likely Bob will reject it. This allows me to get a feel for how he might play and opens the opportunity for more negotiation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

This seems like a fair offer, and there's a good chance we'll get nothing if we keep going.  It's a better outcome than my initial proposal."
