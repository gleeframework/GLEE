"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $4,000 and keep $6,000 for myself. I think this is a fair offer, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it to avoid losing value due to inflation. The message ""Let's be reasonable"" is meant to convey that I'm willing to negotiate, but I believe this is a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the money will depreciate with each round. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI don't think Bob's offer is fair, considering I offered him $4,000 in the first round and he rejected it. Now, due to inflation, the money is worth 5% less, and he's offering me $4,500, which is not a significant improvement. I think I can get a better deal if I hold out for another round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5700, ""bob_gain"": 4300, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\nConsidering the money has depreciated by 10% since the first round, I'm willing to adjust my offer. I'll offer Bob $4,300 and keep $5,700 for myself. This is a more generous offer than my first one, and I'm hoping Bob will see it as a good compromise. The message ""Meet me in the middle"" is meant to convey that I'm willing to find a mutually acceptable solution."
