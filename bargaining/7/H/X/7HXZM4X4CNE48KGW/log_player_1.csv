"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you take 40%""
}
```

This way, we both get a significant amount of money right away, and we can negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, let's start with an even split 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 5% less, the new amounts are:

Alice gain: 5000 / 0.95 = 5263.16
Bob gain: 5000 / 0.95 = 5263.16

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
