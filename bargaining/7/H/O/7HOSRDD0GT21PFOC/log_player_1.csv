"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%. I think this is a good starting point, and it's a fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the lead, let's see if you'll accept 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

Since the money is worth 20% less for Bob, his 80% gain is actually equivalent to 64% of the original $100. Meanwhile, my 20% gain is still 20% of the original $100.

I'm not thrilled about the drastic difference in our gains, but I'm willing to consider it. After all, we have 11 rounds left to negotiate.

For now, I'll decide to {""decision"": ""reject""} this offer and proceed to the next round."

{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60, ""message"": ""Let's try to find a middle ground, 40-60 split?""}

I'm proposing a more balanced split this time, with me getting 40% and Bob getting 60%. I'm hoping this compromise will be more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll try to squeeze out a better deal, let's see if you'll budge 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob's offer is getting more aggressive!

Since the money is worth 48.8% less for Bob, his 70% gain is actually equivalent to 36.4% of the original $100. Meanwhile, my 30% gain is still 30% of the original $100.

I'm not thrilled about the drastic difference in our gains, and I'm starting to feel like Bob is trying to take advantage of the situation. However, I'm willing to consider it. After all, we have 8 rounds left to negotiate.

For now, I'll decide to {""decision"": ""reject""} this offer and proceed to the next round."
