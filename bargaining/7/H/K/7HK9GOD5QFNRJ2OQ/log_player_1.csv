Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}"

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rate, Bob's offer is actually a 4.76% gain for him and a 5% gain for me, which is a more favorable outcome for me. I'll accept his offer.
