450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, I propose a 55/45 split in my favor.  This is a fair offer given the inflation, and I believe it gives us both a good starting point.  Let's work together to get the most out of this deal!",Bob,2,

550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, let's be reasonable. I rejected your offer last round because it heavily favored you. This is my counter-offer: a 55/45 split in my favor. It's fair considering the dwindling value of the money.",Alice,3,

475000.0,525000.0,"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to compromise a little more with a 52.5/47.5 split in my favor. This takes into account the inflation and ensures we both get a decent share.  Let's settle this before the money becomes worthless.",Bob,4,

500000.0,500000.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous. The inflation is eating away at our potential gains.  I propose a simple 50/50 split. Let's end this now and walk away with something substantial.",Alice,5,
