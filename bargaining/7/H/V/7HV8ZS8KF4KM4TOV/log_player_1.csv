"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor.  This is a fair starting point, as it's a 90/10 split.  I hope Bob will be reasonable and accept this offer, but if not, I'm prepared to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While I appreciate Bob's attempt to be ""fair"" by reversing the split, I can't accept this offer. Inflation is a major factor here, and even though I don't see its effect on Bob, I know it's impacting the value of his offer. I'm not willing to settle for such a small share, especially after my initial generous proposal was rejected. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to 7000/3000 in my favor. This is a significant compromise from my first offer, but it still reflects the value I believe my contributions are worth. It also recognizes that inflation is likely affecting the value of Bob's offer more than mine.  I hope this offer is acceptable, as I'm prepared to see this negotiation through until we reach a fair agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Although Bob's offer is significantly worse than my initial proposal, the inflation affecting Bob's gain is making his offer more appealing. It's clear that continuing to reject offers will lead to further reductions for both of us, and with the current offer, I'm still securing a substantial portion of the money.  Therefore, I'll accept this offer and end the game."
