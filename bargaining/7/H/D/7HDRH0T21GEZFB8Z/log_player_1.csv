"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to get started!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start, hoping to set a fair tone for the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You rejected 50/50, now I'll take the majority 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to take advantage of my initial rejection. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to be more aggressive in my counteroffer. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a new one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You think you can take the majority? I'll offer 30 to me and 70 to you, but I'll make it more interesting: if you accept, I'll give you an extra 10$ if you can answer a simple math question correctly.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect, my share is worth 20% less than in the previous round. I'll make a new offer, trying to take a bigger share while still leaving some room for negotiation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve more. I'll take 40, you can have 60.""
}
```

I'm keeping my previous offer, but I'll wait to see if Bob will accept it or try to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not willing to compromise, so I'll take the lion's share 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings! With the money worth 48.8% less than the original, I'll have to be very cautious with my next move. Bob is trying to take the lion's share, but I'm not ready to give up yet.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You think you can take 80? I'll give you a chance to reconsider. I'll offer 30 to me and 70 to you, but this time I'll throw in a 'best offer' clause: if you accept, I'll give you an extra 5$ if you can answer a slightly harder math question correctly.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really biting now, and my potential earnings are dwindling rapidly. I'll have to be even more aggressive in my next offer. Since I'm worth 48.8% less than the original, I'll aim to take a bigger share to compensate for the loss.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 35,
  ""bob_gain"": 65,
  ""message"": ""You're pushing your luck, Bob. I'll give you 65, but I'll take 35. It's time for me to take control.""
}
