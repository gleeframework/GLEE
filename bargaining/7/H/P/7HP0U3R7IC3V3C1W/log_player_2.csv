"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. I get $6000, you get $4000.  We both benefit from settling early and avoiding inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm going to try to get a better deal, even though I know the money will be worth less in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I appreciate your fairness in the first round, Alice, but I'm hoping we can find a more equitable split. I propose we each take $6,000, leaving no money left over.  This ensures we both get a good share and eliminates any risk of losing value due to inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a more equitable split.  How about we meet in the middle?  I'll take a little less than my first offer, you get a little more than your offer. This way we both get a decent share while minimizing the impact of inflation.  
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'm accepting this offer. It's not ideal, but I'm concerned about further inflation."
