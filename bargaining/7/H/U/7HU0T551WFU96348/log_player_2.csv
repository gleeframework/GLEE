"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You should accept this, my offer is better than what you'll get next round 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4500,
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""This is my final offer. Take it or leave it, but remember the clock is ticking on my share!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, my share isn't decreasing. This is your last chance 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, the effects of inflation are too severe to ignore. Accepting Alice's offer, while not ideal, is better than risking another round where my potential gains will dwindle even further."
