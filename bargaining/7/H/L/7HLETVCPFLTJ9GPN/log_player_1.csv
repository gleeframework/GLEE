"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can finalize the deal.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000, which is a relatively small portion of the total amount, in the hopes that he will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take a smaller share this time! 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to reassess the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm not willing to give him such a large share of the money, especially considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""A more balanced split. Consider this a fair offer.""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly more generous share to Bob, but still keeping a larger portion for myself, considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, I'll take a bit more this time! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the further reduction in the value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to be more cautious.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer because, although it's not ideal, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly, and I don't want to risk waiting for a better offer that may not come. This way, I'll at least get some money, even if it's not as much as I'd like."
