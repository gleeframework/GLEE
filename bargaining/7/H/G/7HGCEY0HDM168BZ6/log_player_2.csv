Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out and inflation is eating our money. My offer is still on the table -  a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you said yourself we need to reach a deal. I'm meeting you in the middle.  Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a slightly better outcome, Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of inflation more acutely than I am. Accepting this offer guarantees a reasonable payout, whereas continuing to negotiate carries the risk of walking away with nothing."
