"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000, ""message"": ""I think it's fair that I get the majority, as I'm the one making the first offer. But I'm willing to share some of the wealth!""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's only fair to split it 50/50. No need to negotiate further! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, the inflation means my share will continue to shrink. Accepting 50/50 is the best outcome at this point."
