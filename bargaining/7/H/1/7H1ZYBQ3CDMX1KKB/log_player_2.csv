# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56

**Reasoning:**

While the offer is slightly better, it's essential to show Alice that I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to secure a more favorable outcome. The rate of inflation is hurting me more than her, but there's still a chance to negotiate a better deal."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Okay Alice, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest.  Take it or leave it.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

After several rounds of negotiation, it's time to push for a more favorable outcome while there's still significant value left in the money. A 50/50 split emphasizes fairness and presents a strong stance. It also gives Alice a chance to accept a decent offer before the inflation further erodes the value, potentially making her regret not taking this deal."
