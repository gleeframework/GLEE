With only 6 rounds left, I'm trying to be more flexible while still securing a decent share for myself. I've met Bob halfway, but I'm confident he'll see the value in accepting this offer and avoiding the risk of getting nothing."

I'm taking a bigger risk here, but I'm running out of time. I'm hoping Bob will realize that getting 6000 is better than potentially getting nothing.  We're down to the wire, and it's time to see if we can reach a compromise."
