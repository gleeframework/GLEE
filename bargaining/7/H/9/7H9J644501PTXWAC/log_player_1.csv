"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Accept this fair split and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor, with me getting $70 and Bob getting $30. I think this is a fair starting point, and if Bob accepts, we can avoid wasting time and get our shares sooner."
