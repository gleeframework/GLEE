"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm confident we can both do better than a 3:2 split. I propose we split the money 6:4, giving me a slight advantage for taking the risk of rejecting your offer.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
