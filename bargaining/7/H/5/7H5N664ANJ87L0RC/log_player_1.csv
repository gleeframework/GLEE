"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10, ""message"": ""I'd like to propose a 90/10 split.  It's a fair deal considering the inflation we'll face in future rounds.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 60/40 is a better split. It's still fair considering the inflation and it gives me a bit more breathing room. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
