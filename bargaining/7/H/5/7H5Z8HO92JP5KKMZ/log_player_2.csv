"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's a fair starting point, I can likely get a better deal for myself by seeing if Alice will offer more in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better. Let's flip the script, and I'll take the larger share this time.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle this time. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

Alice has shown she's willing to negotiate, and the offer is closer to what I was aiming for. Taking this deal minimizes the risk of getting nothing at all due to inflation."
