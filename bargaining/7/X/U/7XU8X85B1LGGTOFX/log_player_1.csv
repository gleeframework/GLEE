I'm going to start with a very lopsided offer. I figure Bob might be hesitant to reject a $1,000 offer, even though it's pretty small.  We'll see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob's offer is much better than my last one, but I'm going to reject it.  There's still a lot of money left on the table, and I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm going to try a 50/50 split this time. It's the fairest offer, and hopefully Bob will see that we're getting close to the end of the game and we both need to compromise."
