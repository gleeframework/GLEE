"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair deal - 90 for me, 10 for you.  Let's get this over with quickly! 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Alice, your offer was a bit harsh! Let's be reasonable. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  Think carefully, the value decreases with each round, especially for you.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Ok, I'm willing to compromise, but I need more than 40%.  Let's meet in the middle at 55/45.  This is my final offer before the money loses more value. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting increasingly desperate, which works in my favor.  While her offer isn't terrible, I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round or two. The time pressure is on her more than me due to the faster inflation rate on her end."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""Alice, you're right, we need to settle this soon. But 55/45 is still a bit too skewed for my liking.  How about 65/35? It's a strong offer, and it saves us both from further losses.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. We're both losing money. Let's be practical and split it 60/40 in your favor. This way, we both get something, and we stop this pointless cycle. 
# Bob gain: 60 
# Alice gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** Alice has finally come around to a reasonable offer.  This is the same deal I proposed earlier, and while I might have been able to squeeze out a bit more, the risk of continuing is getting too high. Accepting now guarantees a good return and avoids the potential of walking away with nothing."
