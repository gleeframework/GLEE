"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good deal!""}\n\nI'm offering Bob 40% of the money, which is a generous offer considering I'm the one making the first proposal. The message is a gentle nudge to encourage Bob to accept the offer and end the game quickly, before the inflation kicks in and the money loses value for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your turn to be fair, consider the future rounds! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, although the money is worth 20% less to me now, I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the next round. Bob's message is trying to pressure me into accepting, but I'm not convinced. I'll take my chances and make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, 50-50 is the fairest deal!""}\n\nConsidering the inflation, I'm willing to meet Bob in the middle and offer a 50-50 split. This way, we both get an equal share, and I'm hoping Bob will see the fairness in this proposal and accept it, ending the game before the money loses even more value for me."
