700000.0,300000.0,"I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a larger share to compensate for the inflation disadvantage. Let's split it 70/30. This is a fair offer given the circumstances.",Alice,3,

550000.0,450000.0,"Alice, we're reaching a critical point. I understand your desire for a larger share due to the inflation differential, but your demands are becoming unreasonable.  I'm proposing a 55/45 split in your favor.  This is a fair compromise considering both the time value and the increasing impact of inflation on my potential earnings.  Let's close this deal.",Bob,4,
