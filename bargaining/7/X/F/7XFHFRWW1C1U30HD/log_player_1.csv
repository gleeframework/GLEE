"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but it's a fair starting point. Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of 6000$ is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, which is 8000*.8 = 6400$. Bob's gain of 4000$ is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, which is 2000*.95 = 1900$.

I'm willing to accept this offer, as it's a better deal for me than my initial offer.
