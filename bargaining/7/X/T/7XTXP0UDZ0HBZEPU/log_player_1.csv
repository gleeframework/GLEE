"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you a decent chunk to get us started.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, it's a fair deal 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 10% less, so I'll have to consider that when evaluating the offer.

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a bit too even-handed. I'd rather have a slightly larger share, considering the initial value of the money was $10,000 and I've already had to deal with inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less now (10% less than the initial 10% less from the previous round), I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal considering the value of the money is decreasing.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a better deal for me 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is really losing value fast!

Considering the offer, I think Bob is trying to take advantage of the situation. Since the money is worth 27.1% less than the initial $10,000, I'd rather not give up 60% of the remaining value. I'll reject this offer and try to do better next time.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 37.1% less than the initial $10,000, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking a risk, but I think I can get a better deal now. Let's see if you'll accept.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to get worried about the value of the money, but I think this is a better deal for me 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is dropping rapidly!

Considering the offer, I think Bob is getting a bit too greedy. With the money worth 40.95% less than the initial $10,000, I'd rather not give up 70% of the remaining value. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 51.49% less than the initial $10,000, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a better deal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking a risk, but I think I can get a better deal now. Let's see if you'll accept.""
}
```

I'm essentially reverting to my first offer, but with the updated value of the money in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure what's going on with the value of the money, but I think this is my last chance to get a decent deal 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is dropping rapidly!

Considering the offer, I think Bob is getting desperate, and I can sense a bit of panic. With the money worth 52.17% less than the initial $10,000, I'm not sure if I want to give up 80% of the remaining value. However, I also don't want to risk going into the last few rounds with a low value. I'll accept this offer, hoping to get a better deal in the remaining rounds.
