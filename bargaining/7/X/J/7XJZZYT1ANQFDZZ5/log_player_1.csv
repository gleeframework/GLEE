I propose a 90/10 split, with me receiving 90 dollars and Bob receiving 10 dollars. I believe this is a fair initial offer, considering the inflation rate will affect Bob more than me."

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm making one last effort to reach a compromise before the inflation becomes too drastic for both of us. I'm dropping my offer to 70/30.  This should give Bob a fair share while still allowing me to receive a significant portion of the money."

Round 11

With only two rounds remaining, the pressure is on.  I'm making a final concession and offering a 65/35 split. This is a significant drop for me, but I'm hoping Bob recognizes the urgency of the situation and accepts this offer before the inflation makes it impossible for both of us to get anything."
