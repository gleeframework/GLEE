"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, it's a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair for me to get 60% this time, since you got 60% last time.  Let's be fair, and keep the game moving. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not willing to give up 60% of the remaining $10,000. I think I can do better.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60-40, I'll try to counter with a 55-45 split. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but not all the way to 60%!""}

Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this compromise."
