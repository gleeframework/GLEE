"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\n### As Alice, I will reject Bob's offer because I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the next round. Although the money is worth 20% less to me due to inflation, I'm hoping to increase my share to make up for the loss in value. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n### {""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering inflation""}\n\n### In this round, I've taken into account the inflation and its impact on my gain. Since the money is worth 20% less to me, I've adjusted my offer accordingly. I'm hoping that meeting in the middle, with a slightly higher share for me, will be acceptable to Bob, considering the circumstances."
