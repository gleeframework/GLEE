**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of my shrinking pot. While the offer is getting closer to something acceptable,  I need to show her I'm serious about getting a fair deal.  The rate of inflation is increasing, so waiting too long will hurt, but caving in now sets a bad precedent for the rest of the game."
