"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, it's a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to split the $10,000 evenly, with each of us getting $5,000. This is a fair and straightforward proposal to begin with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit less, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll have to be careful with my decision.

Since the money is worth 20% less for me, I'll have to adjust my expectations accordingly. In this round, $4000 is equivalent to $5000 in the first round, which is a reasonable offer.

However, I'm not sure if I want to give Bob a 60/40 split. I'd rather try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money.

Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll aim for a slightly higher percentage of the remaining value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think this is a fair compromise!""
}
```"
