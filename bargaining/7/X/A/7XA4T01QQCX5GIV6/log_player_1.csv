"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can negotiate from here!""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount of money to start with, and we can discuss further in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split, considering I'm taking the risk of rejection. Let's move on to round 3 if you don't agree. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to be more cautious.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now. I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the 55/45 split, considering I was initially offered 60/40.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further!""
}
```

I'm going for a more equal split this time, hoping Bob will accept it."
