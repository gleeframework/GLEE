"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split it 60-40. I believe this is a more equitable split that still accounts for the diminishing value of money. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
