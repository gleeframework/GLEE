"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This offer gives me 60% of the initial $100, which is a good starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

I'll consider Bob's offer for Round 2. Since the money is worth less, I'd like to get a bit more to compensate. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer, hoping it'll be more favorable to me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Time for me to make another offer!

Considering the inflation, I'll aim to get a bit more this round. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
