"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's make it quick""}\n\nBob will receive $4,000 if he accepts this offer. Since this is the first round, there is no inflation. If he declines, the next round will have the same total amount, but the money will be worth 10% less to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better, but let's start with a more even split. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\nSince the money is worth 10% less to Bob in each subsequent round, his gain of $4,500 in this round is equivalent to $4,050 in the first round (4,500 * 0.9 = 4,050).\n\n###"
