"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can get more if you accept now, but I'm willing to give you a decent share 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 5% inflation, my $4000 gain is now worth 95% of what it was in the first round, so it's actually $3800 in ""real"" value.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll reject it for now. I'd like to see if I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the 5% inflation, my offer is worth 0.95^2 = 0.9025 of the original value, so I need to adjust my proposal accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm still hoping for a 50/50 split.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I'm not going to give you more than 7,000 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 14.26% inflation, my $3000 gain is now worth 85.74% of what it was in the first round, so it's actually $2558.20 in ""real"" value.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll reject it. I'm not happy with the 30/70 split, and I think I can do better.
