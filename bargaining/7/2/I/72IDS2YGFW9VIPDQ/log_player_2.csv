"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm feeling generous, but let's make it snappy. This is my final offer.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Exploiting Time Pressure:** Both players lose money due to inflation, but Alice loses it at a much faster rate (20% vs. 5%). This means Alice is under more pressure to reach a deal quickly.
* **Appearing Firm:** By stating this is my final offer, I'm hoping Alice will be more likely to accept a slightly less favorable deal now rather than risk getting even less in later rounds.
* **Balancing Greed and Fairness:** While I could be greedier, offering Alice a bit over 40% of the initial amount seems like a reasonable compromise to increase the chances of her accepting and ending the game."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll meet you halfway on the last offer, but I need a bit more 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is getting desperate:**  The sharp decrease in her proposed gain (from 6000 to 5800, then down to 4200) shows Alice is feeling the pressure of inflation. 
* **I can hold out a bit longer:** I'm losing value, but not as quickly as Alice.  
* **Aiming for a better deal:**  I'm betting that Alice will be forced to offer a much better split in the next round to avoid losing even more value."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6200, ""alice_gain"": 3800, ""message"": ""Time is running out, Alice. This is a deal you can't refuse!""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Turning the Tables:**  Alice has consistently overestimated her bargaining power. By offering a less favorable deal than before, I'm putting the pressure back on her.
* **Highlighting Time Sensitivity:** My message emphasizes that time is working against Alice more than me. This might nudge her towards accepting a deal that's still in her best interest, even if it's not ideal.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation (Barely):** While my offer is more aggressive, I'm leaving a tiny bit of room for Alice to counter. If she's completely unreasonable, I'm prepared to let the game continue, as my losses will be smaller than hers."
