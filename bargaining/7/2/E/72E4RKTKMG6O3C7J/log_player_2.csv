"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take the lion's share this time, but you'll have a chance to propose in the next round. 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While I understand Alice is trying to be ""fair"", the offer is heavily skewed in her favor.  As Bob, I'd rather take my chances with a proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it a little more evenly this time.  It's your turn to decide if you want to accept or play another round.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it closer to 60/40.  Remember, the value of the money is decreasing with each round, so it's in both of our interests to reach an agreement. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While the offer is still not ideal, it's much closer to a fair split than the previous round. Since the money continues to decrease in value, it's in my best interest to accept this offer and avoid further losses."
