Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to a more even split, we're still in the early rounds. Accepting now would mean losing a significant chunk of potential earnings due to inflation. It's worth holding out a bit longer to see if we can negotiate a better deal."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round.

# Alice's message: I'm taking a bigger risk, so I want a bigger share 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting greedier, and the inflation is starting to bite. However, we're still not in a desperate situation. Accepting this offer would mean losing almost half the value compared to the beginning. Let's push a little further and see if Alice becomes more reasonable."
