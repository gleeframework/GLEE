"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'm willing to give you 10,000 to ensure we both get something. 
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer is far too low. While getting something is better than nothing, I need to aim for a much larger share of the money, especially considering it devalues over time for me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Alice, that initial offer was far too low. Let's be reasonable: I'm proposing a 65/35 split in my favor.  This reflects the time pressure on my side due to inflation."" 
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better deal than 35%. Let's split it 60/40, acknowledging the time pressure but also ensuring a more equitable outcome. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer is getting closer to reasonable, but it's still not good enough. Accepting 40% now means I'm losing a significant portion of the initial value due to the two rounds of inflation. I need to push for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, we need to settle this now. I'm proposing a 55/45 split. This is my final offer, considering the time pressure and the value I've already lost to inflation."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the pressure, Bob. Let's meet in the middle and split the money evenly.  It's the fairest solution considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

A 50/50 split is a fair outcome at this point. While I would have preferred a larger share initially, the impact of inflation is too significant now. Accepting this offer ensures I receive a substantial amount, even with the accumulated devaluation."
