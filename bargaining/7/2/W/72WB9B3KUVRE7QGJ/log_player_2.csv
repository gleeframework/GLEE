"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. You get a little bit, I get most of it.  Let's see what happens. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll take my chances and try to get a better offer in the next round. The 20% inflation is a concern, but I think I can get a better deal than 10% of the original amount. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering the inflation I'm already losing value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a larger share to compensate for the future inflation impacting me less. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer as well. Although the inflation is taking its toll, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal. Alice's argument about compensating for future inflation doesn't hold much weight since her share isn't affected by inflation. I'll try to push for a more favorable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","### {""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Considering I've already lost 36% of the value, I think this is a reasonable split. Let's settle before it devalues further.""}"
