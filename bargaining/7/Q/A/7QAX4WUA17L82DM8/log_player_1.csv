"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $450,000 is worth 95% of the initial $600,000, which is $570,000. Bob's gain of $550,000 is worth 90% of the initial $400,000, which is $360,000.

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, considering I could have gotten $570,000 in the previous round. I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 95% of its original value from the first round, I'll aim for a higher percentage to account for the lost value.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm offering to take 70% of the initial $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $500,000 is worth 86.74% of the initial $600,000, which is $517,440. Bob's gain of $500,000 is worth 72.9% of the initial $400,000, which is $291,600.

Since I'm getting a relatively equal split, I'll accept this offer.
