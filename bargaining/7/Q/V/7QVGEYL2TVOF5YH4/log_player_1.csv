"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly, I'll take 60%""}\n\nIn this offer, I, Alice, propose to take $600,000 (60% of the total), leaving $400,000 (40%) for Bob. My reasoning is that since the money loses value faster for me with each round, I want to secure a larger share upfront to minimize my losses from inflation. The message to Bob emphasizes the fairness of the division, hoping he will see the offer as reasonable and accept it to avoid further devaluation of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a little more than your initial proposal, but I think this division is fair. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject Bob's offer because, despite his willingness to give me a little more than my initial proposal, the division he proposes still doesn't compensate for the 20% loss in value I incur due to inflation from the first round. Accepting this offer would mean I effectively get less value than what I initially proposed, making it an unfair deal for me. I'll proceed to the next round, hoping to negotiate a better division that accounts for the disproportionate impact of inflation on my share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I need a larger share to break even.""}\n\nIn this offer, I increase my proposed share to $700,000 (70% of the total), leaving $300,000 (30%) for Bob. My message to Bob explains that due to the higher rate of inflation affecting my share, I need a larger portion to compensate for the loss in value over the rounds. This offer is more aggressive than the first, reflecting the urgency to secure a better deal before the money devalues further."
