```

  ""bob_gain"": 30,

# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation taking a significant toll, I need to be cautious. However, I don't want to give Bob too much more than the last round. I'll try to hold the line and see if I can get a better deal.

# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is plummeting! I need to be realistic about the situation. While I'd prefer to get a higher share, I don't want to leave the table with nothing. I'll accept this offer, hoping that Bob will be more generous in future negotiations.
