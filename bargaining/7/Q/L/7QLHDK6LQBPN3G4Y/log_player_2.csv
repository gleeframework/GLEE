# Alice gain: 40\n\nPlease relay this to Alice."

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a little more, but I'm not going to let you take all the advantage. Let's split it 55-45. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nNow it's my turn! Here's my proposal:\n\n###\nMy offer:
# My message: I'll take 57, you can have 43.
# Bob gain: 57
# Alice gain: 43\n\nPlease relay this to Alice."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","My offer:

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We've been going back and forth, let's just split it evenly again. We're losing a lot of money with each round. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nFinally! I'm glad we could come to an agreement. It was a long negotiation, but I think we both lost enough money to inflation. Splitting it evenly seems fair at this point. Let's shake on it and end the game!\n\n(And a note to myself: maybe next time, I should consider the inflation factor a bit more when making my proposals...)"
