This is a tough one, but I have to accept. 

Here's why:

* **Severe Inflation:** The inflation is killing me.  A 35/65 split right now is better than risking getting even less in subsequent rounds.
* **Bob's Stubbornness:**  Bob has consistently been pushing for a larger share and seems unlikely to budge significantly.  

It's frustrating to accept such an uneven deal, but the longer this goes on, the less I'll get."
