Round 6

# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nThe offer is still not good enough considering the inflation. I'd like to try to get a better deal in the next round. The money is worth over 25% less for me now, so I need to take that into account. I'll try to make another offer that takes into account the rapidly decreasing value of the money for me. Let's see what happens next! If Alice said this is her final offer, maybe she's bluffing, or maybe she's willing to walk away. I'll take the risk and try to get a better deal."

Round 8

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is it, Bob. We're almost out of time. I'm giving you a bigger share, but this is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 38 
# Alice gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation, I've decided to accept this offer. The money is worth over 33% less for me now, and I don't think I can get a better deal in the remaining rounds. Alice has been increasing her offers, but the value of the money for me has been decreasing rapidly. I'll take the 38, which is worth less than the original 50 due to inflation, but it's better than risking getting nothing if we don't reach an agreement within the 12 rounds."
