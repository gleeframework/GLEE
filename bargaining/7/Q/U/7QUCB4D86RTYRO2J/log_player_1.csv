"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```

  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take 60% and you can take 40%""

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems fair to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, but still be generous 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not a great deal for me, considering the money is worth less with each round. I'll have to think carefully.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3000,
  ""bob_gain"": 7000,
  ""message"": ""I'm being more aggressive, but still willing to compromise""
