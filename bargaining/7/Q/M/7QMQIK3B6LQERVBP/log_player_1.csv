"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think we can be more equitable. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. This still gives you a significant share, and allows for a more balanced outcome. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{
