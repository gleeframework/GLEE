"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share to test the waters and see how he reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try for a 50/50 split, no need to overthink it 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, my gain of 5000 is actually 4500 in real value.

I'll think for a moment... I'm not sure I want to give Bob half of the remaining money, especially since I don't know how much the inflation affects him. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You wanted 50/50, but I think I'm worth more than you. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

Let's see how Bob reacts this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being greedy, but I'll try to meet you halfway 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, my gain of 6000 is actually around 7320 in real value.

I'm not sure I want to give Bob 4000, but I'm also not sure if I can do better. I'll think for a moment...

Actually, I'll accept this offer. I think it's a fair compromise, and I don't want to risk going to another round.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
