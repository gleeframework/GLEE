"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a relatively even split, with a slight bias towards myself to account for the potential loss of value due to inflation in subsequent rounds. The message is a simple appeal to fairness, hoping Bob might accept to avoid further devaluation of the money for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script. I'll take the bigger share this time. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI reject this offer because accepting it would mean I end up with a significantly lower amount than I initially proposed, and due to inflation, the value of the money I gain is already reduced by 20% compared to the first round. By rejecting, I aim to negotiate a better deal in the next round, hoping Bob might be more willing to compromise to end the game sooner.\n\n###\n\n### Alice: Round 3\n\nMy next offer will take into account the devaluation of the money for me and aim to find a middle ground that might be acceptable to Bob, considering he has shown a willingness to take a larger share but also that prolonging the game risks further devaluation for me.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Meet me halfway considering inflation""}\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know if Bob accepts this offer or if we proceed to the next round."
