"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start, and we can reassess later.""}

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 evenly, with each of us getting $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting a smaller share, but it's a good starting point. Let's see if you can do better next time. 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about getting only $2,500, especially since the value of that amount is decreasing due to inflation. I think I can do better than this."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4000, ""bob_gain"": 6000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I still think I deserve a bigger chunk. Let's see if you'll meet me in the middle.""}

I'm proposing a slightly more generous offer, with me getting $4,000 and Bob getting $6,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer to the middle, but I'm still not willing to give up too much control. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer again.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

While I'm getting closer to the middle with this offer, I still think I can do better. The value of the money is decreasing rapidly due to inflation, and I'm not willing to settle for $4,500 when I could potentially get more. I'll keep pushing for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle and split it evenly. It's not ideal, but I think it's a fair compromise given the inflation rate.""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a compromise considering the decreasing value of money due to inflation."
