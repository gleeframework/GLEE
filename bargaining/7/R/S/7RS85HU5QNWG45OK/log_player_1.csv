Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split this evenly, Alice. This way we both get a decent share before the inflation hits too hard. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

While Bob's offer seems fair on the surface, the inflation disparity means I lose out in the long run. I need to push for a slightly better split before the value diminishes further."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close to a point where the losses from inflation will be significant.  Let's split this a bit more in my favor this round to avoid further erosion of our gains. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

""decision"": ""reject"" 
}

Bob is trying to use the pressure of inflation to his advantage. While I am feeling the impact of inflation more, accepting this offer would mean a significant loss compared to my initial ask. I need to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. The inflation is hurting both of us. My offer is still the most sensible to minimize our losses.  Take it or leave it.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's time to get firm.  

* **Pressure Point:**  Bob likely believes I'm feeling more and more pressure with each round.  By repeating my initial offer, I signal firmness and that I'm not panicking.
* **Time is Money:**  Every round is costing both of us.  Dragging this out only benefits Bob slightly, as my losses are greater.  This underlines the urgency for him to accept.
* **Potential for Loss Aversion:** By framing it as ""take it or leave it,""  I introduce a potential loss for Bob.  If we go another round, even if his offer is better for him, it might not be as good as the current deal on the table.
 
This is a calculated risk, but at this point, demonstrating resolve is crucial."
