"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate, right?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair starting point. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my potential gain is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, so I'll have to be careful.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think for a moment... 

I'll reject this offer. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 80% of its original value after two rounds of inflation, I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3200,
  ""bob_gain"": 6800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation. Let's meet in the middle?""
}
```

I'm proposing a new split, taking into account the reduced value of the money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think 55/45 is a fair split considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my potential gain is now worth only 51.2% of what it was in the first round, so I need to be cautious.

Considering Bob's offer, I think 55/45 is a decent split, but I'd like to try to get an even better deal. I'll reject this offer and see if I can get a better proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, my potential gain is now worth only 40.96% of what it was in the first round. I'll have to be even more careful with my next offer.

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3200,
  ""bob_gain"": 6800,
  ""message"": ""I'm sticking to my guns, I think this is a fair split considering the inflation. No need to overthink it.""
}
```

I'm re-proposing the same offer as in Round 3, hoping Bob will accept this time."
