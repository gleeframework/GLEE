Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since I initially offered a 60/40 split in my favor and Bob rejected it, I'm not willing to accept the same split in his favor, especially considering the inflation affects me more. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nLet's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3

I'll propose a 58/42 split and see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle. Let's see how he responds!"
