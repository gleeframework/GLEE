"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make this quick.  900k for me, 100k for you. It's a generous offer considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
I'm Bob, and I'm not going to accept being given only 100k while Alice gets 900k.  Let's see what she's willing to offer if I make a counter-proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's be reasonable. 850k for me, 150k for you.  The clock is ticking, and it's only getting worse for you. 
# Bob gain: 150000 
# Alice gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Alice is still trying to take the lion's share. I'm not going to give in yet. We're both losing money with each round, so she needs to be more realistic."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

  ""bob_gain"": 400000,

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but you're playing a dangerous game. 800k for me, 200k for you.  Take it before the deal gets even worse for you. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice is still being unreasonable.  While the money is worth less for me, I'm not going to be bullied into accepting a deal that's heavily skewed in her favor.  I'm going to continue to negotiate for a fairer split."
