"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle, Bob. Fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'll give you a small chunk too 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less for Bob, his offer is actually a bit more generous than it seems.

I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 70/30 split, especially since I'm getting a relatively small share. I'd like to negotiate further. It's still early in the game, and I'd like to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a 70/30 split, I'll aim for a slightly more favorable ratio this time. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like a bit more. How about a 55/45 split?""
}
```

Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value for Bob, but he's still trying to take a larger share. I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with this offer. I'd like to get a bit more than 40% of the remaining money. The fact that Bob's offer is decreasing in value due to inflation makes me think that he might be willing to give up more if I push for it. I'll try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With Bob's offer being worth 27.1% less than the original, I'll aim for an even better ratio this time. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while. How about 60/40?""
}
```

Let's see if Bob is willing to give me the majority share!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I'm still not willing to give up too much 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value for Bob at an increasing rate, which makes me think that he's getting a bit desperate. I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with this offer. I'd like to get a bit more than 45% of the remaining money. The fact that Bob's offer is decreasing in value at an alarming rate makes me think that he might be willing to give up more if I push for it. I'll try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With Bob's offer being worth 40.95% less than the original, I'll aim for an even better ratio this time. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6500,
  ""bob_gain"": 3500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while. How about 65/35?""
}
```

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, but I'm not going to give up too much more 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value for Bob at an incredible rate! I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm willing to accept this offer. At this point, I think it's better to get a 50/50 split than to risk getting nothing. The money is losing value so rapidly for Bob that I think he's getting close to his limit, and I don't want to push him too hard."
