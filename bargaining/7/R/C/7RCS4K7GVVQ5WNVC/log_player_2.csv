"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer leaves us both with a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer seems fair at face value, Bob is losing to inflation. Accepting $4,000 now might seem okay, but getting a larger share later, even with the 20% reduction, could be more beneficial in the long run."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I understand you want a fair deal, Alice.  However, inflation hurts my position over time.  This offer accounts for that while still giving you a significant share.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my counter-offer, Bob. It's important to find a balance, and this is fair considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is trying to take advantage of the situation. Her offer is now worse for Bob than her initial offer, despite the fact that inflation is working against him. Bob needs to hold firm and try to negotiate a better deal.  Accepting this offer would set a bad precedent for future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Alice, we need to find a compromise soon. This offer is a slight adjustment to account for the time pressure and ensures we both benefit from this deal.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out. This offer is a good compromise to reach a deal before inflation hurts you further. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** The situation is getting critical. Accepting $4,800 now is significantly better than risking getting nothing if the rounds run out. While not ideal, this offer ensures Bob gets a reasonable share before inflation eats away at the value."
