"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. With the inflation, my gain of 55 is actually worth 95% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain of 45 is worth 90% of what it was in the first round. Hmm...

I'll reject this offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer. Since my gain is worth 5% less each round, I'll aim to get a larger share now to compensate for the future losses.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 65,
  ""bob_gain"": 35
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to be more aggressive now. With the inflation, my gain of 50 is worth 86.74% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain of 50 is worth 81% of what it was in the first round. It's a 50-50 split, which is a good compromise, considering the decreasing value of money.

I'll accept this offer.
