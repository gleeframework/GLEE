"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate further""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor, with me getting $60 and Bob getting $40. The message is a gentle nudge to see if Bob will accept this straightforward offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting already!

Considering the offer, I'll have to accept the reduced share. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the $30 and call it a day."
