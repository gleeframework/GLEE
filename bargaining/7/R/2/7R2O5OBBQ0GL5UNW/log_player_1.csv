"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll give you a decent share, but don't expect me to go easy on you.""
}
```

This offer gives me 80% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob gets 20%. I'm hoping this will be a good starting point for negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than that. I'm proposing a more even split. Let's see if you're willing to be a bit more fair. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to be careful.

After considering Bob's proposal, I think it's a bit more reasonable than my initial offer. However, I'd like to squeeze out a bit more for myself. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Your offer is a bit better, but I'm not giving up that much. I'll make a counteroffer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer. Here's my next proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not getting any younger, and I need a bigger share to secure my future. Meet me in the middle, or we'll be back to square one.""
}
```"
