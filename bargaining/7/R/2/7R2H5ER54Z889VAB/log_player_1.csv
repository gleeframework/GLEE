"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering the inflation, I'll have to weigh the potential gain against the risk of waiting for a better offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Time to make a new proposal!

Considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer, I'll try to be more aggressive this time.

{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. It's a 50/50 split, which is a fair offer, but considering the inflation, it's actually a pretty good deal for me. I'll have to decide whether to take it or wait for a better offer.
