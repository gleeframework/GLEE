"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a pretty unequal split in this first round. I figure it's a good way to test the waters and see if Bob is willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

This is a much more reasonable offer, and with only 12 rounds, it's best not to be too greedy."
