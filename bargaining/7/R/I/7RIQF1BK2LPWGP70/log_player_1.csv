{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose a 90/10 split, giving myself 900,000 dollars and Bob 100,000 dollars. 

I want to start with a fair but generous offer, considering the inflation rates, and see if Bob is willing to accept a quick resolution."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I propose a 85/15 split. While Bob's offer was aggressive, I believe we can still reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I need a larger share to compensate for the increasing inflation."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm not satisfied with this offer. While it is better than nothing, the inflation rate is significantly impacting my gains, and I believe I can still negotiate a better deal for myself. I need to be more strategic with my offers and aim for a higher share to counteract the inflation."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

I'm proposing a 75/25 split.  Bob's offer was increasingly unfavorable, but I'm still hoping to reach a resolution. By offering a slightly lower share than my previous offer, I'm acknowledging the inflation impact, but I'm also making it clear that I need a significant share to be satisfied."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is an improvement from the previous round, it's still significantly below what I believe I deserve considering the increasing inflation.  I'm confident I can still negotiate a better deal, even with the time pressure."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm proposing a 70/30 split.  The inflation is accelerating, and I need to secure a higher share to compensate for the decreasing value of my gains. I'm willing to compromise, but I can't afford to lose much more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to a more balanced split, it's still not enough considering the high inflation rate.  I need to hold out for a better deal, even though the time is running out."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}
```

I'm proposing a 65/35 split. Time is running out, and I need to secure a large enough share to compensate for the dramatic inflation. This is my final offer, and if Bob rejects it, we both risk losing everything."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10

{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

With only a few rounds left, the inflation is severely impacting my gains.  While this is a 50/50 split, it's better than getting nothing. I need to accept this offer and avoid the risk of losing everything."
