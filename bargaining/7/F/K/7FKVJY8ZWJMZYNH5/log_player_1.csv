I'm proposing a 900,000 / 100,000 split. I'm being generous in this first round to show good faith, but keep in mind inflation will significantly reduce the value of the money if we go to subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 720000, ""bob_gain"": 280000}
```

I'm offering a 720,000 / 280,000 split.  While this is less than my original offer, inflation is hitting hard, and I need to ensure I secure a significant share of the money before it becomes essentially worthless."
