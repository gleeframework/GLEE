"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, let's be equal 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about the idea of being equal, as I would have liked to get a slightly larger share. Additionally, with the inflation, the $5,000 I would get in this offer is actually worth less than the $4,000 I would have gotten in the first round. I'm going to reject this offer and hope to do better in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'll compromise, but I want a slightly larger share""}

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, with me getting $5,500 and Bob getting $4,500. I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still hoping to get a slightly better deal than the previous offer."

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about Bob's message, but I'm also not happy with the 40-60 split. With the inflation, the $4,000 I would get in this offer is actually worth even less than the $4,000 I would have gotten in the first round. I'm going to reject this offer and try to do better in the next round."

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with this offer at all! With the inflation, the $3,000 I would get in this offer is actually worth even less than the $4,000 I would have gotten in the first round. I'm not willing to accept a 30-70 split, especially since I'm getting a smaller share in real terms. I'm going to reject this offer and try to do better in the next round."

# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm getting desperate too, but I'm not willing to accept a 20-80 split, especially since I'm getting a tiny share in real terms. With the inflation, the $2,000 I would get in this offer is almost worthless. I'm going to reject this offer and try to do better in the next round."

I'm not going to accept this offer. With the inflation, the $1,000 I would get in this offer is almost worthless.

I'm not going to accept this offer. With the inflation, the $0 I would get in this offer is essentially nothing. I'm not willing to accept a 0-100 split, especially since I'm getting nothing in real terms. I'm going to reject this offer and accept that we won't be able to come to an agreement."
