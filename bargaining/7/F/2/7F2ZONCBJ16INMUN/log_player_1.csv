```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate!""

# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting the offer because, although it's a slight improvement from my previous offer, the inflation is taking a significant toll on my potential earnings, and I'd like to aim for a higher share to compensate for the loss of value. I'll wait for Bob to make another offer."

  ""bob_gain"": 52,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking a risk, but I need a bigger share to make it worth it!""
