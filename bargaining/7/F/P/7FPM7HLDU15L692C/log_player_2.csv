I'm going to reject this offer.  While it's a decent starting point, I'm hoping to get a better deal, especially since the money is losing value with each round."

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer again.  While Alice is showing a willingness to compromise, I believe there's still room for a better deal for me, given the ongoing inflation that is disproportionately impacting Alice's potential gains."

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm going to reject this offer. While I appreciate that Alice is trying to be flexible, the inflation is hitting her harder than me, so I'm holding out for a better deal. I think a 60-40 split is still reasonable, given the circumstances."
