After two rounds, the effects of inflation are already noticeable. While a 65/35 split in round 2 was a good strategic move, Alice's offer of a 50/50 split in round 3 is now the most logical choice. 

Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:** With each round, the value of the money decreases significantly. Accepting a slightly lower amount now is better than risking a worse outcome in later rounds.
* **Fairness:**  Alice's offer of a 50/50 split is fair, especially considering the inflationary environment. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a better deal in future rounds is very risky.  There's no guarantee Alice will offer a more favorable split, and the value of the money will continue to decline. 

Accepting the 50/50 split ensures a reasonable and guaranteed payout, minimizing potential losses due to inflation.
