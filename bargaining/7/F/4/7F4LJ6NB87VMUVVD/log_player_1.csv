"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This is fair considering the risk of inflation. If we agree now, we both avoid losing money in the next round.  
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
