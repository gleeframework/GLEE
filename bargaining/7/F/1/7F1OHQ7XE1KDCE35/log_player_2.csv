Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:

{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'm taking the offer.  The inflation is really starting to bite, and while I'd prefer a better deal, 250,000 is better than nothing at this point."
