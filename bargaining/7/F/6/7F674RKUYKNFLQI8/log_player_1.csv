"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me $6,000 and Bob $4,000. I'm framing it as a fair start, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try for a 50-50 split this time! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain of $5,000 is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, which is $4,500.

Considering Bob's offer, I think a 50-50 split is a reasonable compromise. I'll accept his offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
