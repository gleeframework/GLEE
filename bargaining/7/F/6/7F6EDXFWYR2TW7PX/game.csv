6000.0,4000.0,Let's start with a reasonable offer. I take a bit more considering the inflation rate impacts me more.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
5200.0,4800.0,"Your rate is a bit too steep for me. Let's meet in the middle, considering the inflation will hurt you more as we go.",Bob,2,
,,"I appreciate the offer, Bob, but the split still doesn't feel quite fair considering the inflation disparity.  Let's try to find a better balance in the next round.",Alice,2,reject
5600.0,4400.0,"Okay, Bob, how about this? I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need you to meet me halfway to account for the inflation difference.  This offer ensures we both benefit.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
5000.0,5000.0,Let's stop wasting time.  A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both walk away with something substantial.,Bob,4,
,,"While I appreciate the simplicity of a 50/50 split, Bob, it ignores the reality of our situation. The longer this goes on, the less valuable the money becomes, especially for me. I'm willing to compromise, but not at the cost of a significant loss. Let's try for a more realistic solution in the next round.",Alice,4,reject
5400.0,4600.0,"Bob, I'm aiming for a solution that benefits us both. This offer is a compromise, acknowledging the time pressure and the inflation working against us. It's a fair deal â€“ let's seal the deal and avoid further losses.",Alice,5,
