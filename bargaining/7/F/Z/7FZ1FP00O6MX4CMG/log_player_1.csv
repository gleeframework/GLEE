"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000, leaving Bob with 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for Bob, the offer is effectively:

# Alice gain: 7000
# Bob gain: 2400

I'll accept this offer.
