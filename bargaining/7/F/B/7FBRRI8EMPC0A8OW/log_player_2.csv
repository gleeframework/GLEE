{""bob_gain"": 525000, ""alice_gain"": 475000, ""message"": ""I appreciate your fairness in the first round.  However, I believe a more balanced split is in our mutual interest, and will help us both avoid losing too much to inflation.  Let's move forward with this slight adjustment.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems we both value fairness. Let's stop wasting time and split this evenly before inflation eats away even more of our potential gains. A 50/50 split is the most logical and efficient outcome here. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000
