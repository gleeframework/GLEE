"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you $4000""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is a 40% share of the original $10,000. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can wrap up the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a fair split, but I want a bit more for myself 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $5,000 is now worth only 80% of what it was in the first round, which is $4,000.

I'm not sure if this is a fair split, but I'll consider it. Since the offer is equal, I'll have to decide based on the fact that I'm losing 20% of my potential gain due to inflation. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time. I'll propose a smaller share for Bob, hoping to take advantage of the situation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking a risk, but I think I deserve more""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I'm not willing to give up more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $4,000 is now worth only 48.8% of what it was in the first round, which is approximately $1,920.

I'm not thrilled with this offer, but I'm not sure if I can do better. Since Bob is offering a smaller share, I'll consider it. However, I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal. I'll accept this offer.
