"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40 to start, I'll take the risk of negotiating further""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split to start, and I'm framing it as a starting point for negotiation. This way, Bob has an incentive to respond and we can continue the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's switch roles, I think a 60-40 split is fair, and it avoids any further risk of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 10% less, so I need to be more cautious.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further. I think 40 is too low for me, considering the risk of inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to increase my share while keeping in mind the inflation risk. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll take 55, it's a fair compromise, but I'm still open to negotiations""
}
```

I'm increasing my share to 55, but I'm still leaving room for Bob to make a counteroffer."
