"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm feeling generous, but let's be realistic. This round only!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Counteroffer, still fairly generous 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Time is money Alice!  Let's be practical - this offer is my bottom line.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, Bob. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Even though the inflation is hitting hard, accepting this offer would mean I get even less of the original split than Alice's first offer. I need to hold out for a better deal, but time is definitely becoming a factor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Okay Alice, let's split this right down the middle.  Take it or leave it, we're running out of time!""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm offering a 50/50 split. This is the fairest deal and with the increasing inflation, it's getting riskier to hold out for more. Alice might be more inclined to accept a clean split as well with the pressure of time."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Middle ground was last round, now it's my turn! 
# Bob gain: 4100 
# Alice gain: 5900 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**  Alice is playing hardball, and this offer is worse than her last one.  It's risky, but I have to show her I'm serious about getting a reasonable deal.  The inflation is hurting, but we still have a few rounds to go."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4700, ""alice_gain"": 5300, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  Meet me halfway at least - it's better than nothing if we run out of time!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I need to signal I'm willing to negotiate, but I can't go much lower.  This offer is slightly better for her than her last, but still within a reasonable range for me (barely, considering the inflation).  Hopefully she sees the urgency."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 83.22% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You should have taken my previous offer, now it's even less 
# Bob gain: 3900 
# Alice gain: 6100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  This is getting really painful. While it's a terrible offer, if I reject it and even offer her a 50/50 split next round, the inflation means I'll get even less than $3900. It's a bitter pill to swallow, but I need to cut my losses at this point."
