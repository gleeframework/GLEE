"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

This is a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll reject Bob's offer. I was hoping for a more even split, and this one seems a bit skewed in his favor. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In Round 3, I'll make a counteroffer to Bob. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

This offer is a slight adjustment from the initial 50/50 split, but still a relatively even split. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
