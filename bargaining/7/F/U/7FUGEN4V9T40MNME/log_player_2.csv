"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair!  I propose we split the money evenly. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the offer is to split the money evenly and there's no inflation in the first round, it seems like a reasonable starting point. However, considering that with each passing round, the money's value decreases for Alice but not for me, I might be able to negotiate a better deal in subsequent rounds. But, starting with a fair split seems fair.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}"
