"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but still a fair deal 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, I'd like to negotiate a bit more. Since Bob is offering a 80/20 split, I'll try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like a slightly better deal, can you meet me at 55/45?""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will meet me in the middle."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less again, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. I'll aim for a slightly higher share to compensate for the decrease in value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""Meet me at 42/58, it's a fair split""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 27.1% less than the original amount, I'll need to adjust my expectations. Bob's offer is a 65/35 split, which is a bit too skewed towards him. I'll try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to aim for a 45/55 split, can you meet me there?""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will be willing to compromise further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 27.1% less than the original amount, I'll need to be more aggressive in my offer. I'll aim for a higher share to compensate for the decrease in value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3800,
  ""bob_gain"": 6200,
  ""message"": ""I'll take 38/62, it's my final offer""
}
```

I'm trying to get a better deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower."
