{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
``` 

I'm going to try a slightly lower offer for Bob, hoping to incentivize him to accept before the inflation hits too hard.  $800,000 for me and $200,000 for him."

# Bob gain: 550000

I'm still holding out for a better deal!  Inflation is hurting Bob more, so there's still room for negotiation."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}

I'm going to lower my offer again, but I'm confident Bob will see the value in accepting before the inflation wipes out even more of his potential gains."

While I'd love to get more, inflation is hitting Bob harder than me. This is a fair split, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all."
