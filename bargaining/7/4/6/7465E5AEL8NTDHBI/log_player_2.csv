"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a fair split. Let's get this over with! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While this is a ""fair"" split right now, the money is worth less to me in the next round.  I'll see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I think this is a better split for both of us.  It's still a fair deal, but we both get more money this way.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to go, given the current circumstances. Let's end this game. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
Even though I gain less than the previous round, with inflation, Alice's offer is worth less than what she offered in the first round.  I'll take the 50/50 split."
