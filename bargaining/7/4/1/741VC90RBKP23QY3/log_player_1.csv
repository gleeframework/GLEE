Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than your initial offer. How about I get $55 and you get $45? It's still a good deal for you, considering the money is worth 10% less to you now. 
# Alice gain: 45

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You said it was your final offer, but I'm willing to take a chance. Considering the money is now worth 19% less to you, I think my offer of $60 for me and $40 for you is fair. Take it or leave it!

Even though the value of the money is decreasing for me, Bob is getting greedier and more confident. I need to hold out for a better offer. It's risky, but I think I can get him to agree to a 50/50 split in the next round."
