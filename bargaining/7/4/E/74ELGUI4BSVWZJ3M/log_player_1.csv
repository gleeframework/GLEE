"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I deserve a bit more.""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. I believe this is a reasonable offer, considering I'm taking on the risk of the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the inflation rate.  Let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI will reject this offer. Given the inflation rates, I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the next round. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, I need to consider the decreasing value and aim for a higher amount to compensate for the loss. Let's proceed to the next round!

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll try to make an offer that takes into account the decreasing value of money due to inflation. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less than the original amount, and Bob's money is worth 10% less, I'll aim for a slightly higher amount than before to compensate for the loss.
