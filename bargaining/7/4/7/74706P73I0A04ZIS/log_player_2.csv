**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly trying to see how much she can get away with. While her offers are slowly getting better, we're still in early rounds. Rejecting this shows I'm serious about getting a fair deal."

# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**  We're at the halfway point, and Alice is clearly feeling the pressure. Her offer is inching closer to a more even split. Rejecting this shows I'm willing to play hardball to get a better outcome, especially with time ticking away."

{
""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Time pressure is on, but I still think I deserve the bigger share 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  The clock is ticking, and Alice is stubbornly refusing to offer anything better than a 55/45 split. While I'd prefer a more even split, accepting this now guarantees I at least get something rather than risking getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
