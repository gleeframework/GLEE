"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55/45 split.  This is more fair in the long run, considering the inflation we're facing. It gives you a good amount now, and still leaves me with a comfortable share after the devaluation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
