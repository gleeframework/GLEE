Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  Since I don't know how inflation affects Bob, I'm going to try and maximize my share in the first round.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

While a 50/50 split isn't ideal, it's better than risking getting nothing.  Inflation means my potential gains in the next round are significantly lower, and there's no guarantee Bob will offer me anything.  Accepting this offer secures at least half of the money, which is a good outcome considering the circumstances."
