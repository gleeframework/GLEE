"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving us both $5,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game on a good note."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small chunk, but I'm hoping to negotiate more in future rounds! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting! My potential gain is worth 20% less than before, so I need to be strategic.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now. I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal in the next round, considering the inflation factor.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation still affecting my potential gain, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""You're getting a bit greedy, Bob! I'm willing to compromise, but I need a fair share.""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly better deal for myself, hoping Bob will be willing to compromise and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not satisfied, but I'll give you a slightly better deal. You're getting closer to a fair share! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain! It's worth 48.8% less than the original $10,000.

Considering the situation, I'll accept Bob's offer. I'm not sure if I can do better in the next round, and this deal is still a relatively fair share considering the circumstances.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
