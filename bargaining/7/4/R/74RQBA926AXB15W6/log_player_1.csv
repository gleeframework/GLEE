"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept and we can split the $10,000 now!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself, hoping he'll accept and we can finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's a fair offer, and we can avoid the risk of inflation eating away at our gains. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully. Since the money is worth 20% less now, I'd be getting $5,000, which is equivalent to $6,250 in the first round. Not bad, but I was hoping to get a bit more.

However, Bob's proposal is fair, and I don't want to risk losing more money due to inflation. I'll accept his offer.
