Let's see if we can do better!  I want to see what Alice will offer if she's the one making the proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a more even distribution, and I'm hoping Alice will see the fairness in it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice is still proposing a very uneven split. Even with the inflation, I think I can do better by continuing to play."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}
```

I'm going to increase my proposed share slightly to 55% in an attempt to be more enticing to Alice, but still ensure I get a fair share."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I still think a more even split is possible, the inflation is starting to bite hard. Accepting this offer will secure me at least some money."
