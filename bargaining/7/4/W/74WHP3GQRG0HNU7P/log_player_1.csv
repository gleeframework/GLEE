Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a very aggressive offer in the first round. I want to maximize my share and see if Bob will be tempted by even a small amount.  Let's see how this goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is insulting!  I'm not giving up nearly all the money.  I'll make a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999900, ""bob_gain"": 100}
```

I'm still going for a large portion of the money, but I'm willing to offer Bob a slightly larger share this time. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to him, considering the inflation affecting his gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100 
# Bob gain: 999900 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too one-sided. I'm not giving up nearly all the money, even with the inflation affecting his gains. I'll try a different approach in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm going for a 50/50 split this time.  With the inflation hitting Bob harder, I think this is a fair offer that he might accept. Let's see if he's ready to compromise."
