"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a good starting point, Alice. However, the inflation affects me more than you, so I propose a slightly more balanced split this time.  Let's try to reach an agreement quickly! 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
