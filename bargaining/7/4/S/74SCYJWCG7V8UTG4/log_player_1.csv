"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, it's a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. I think this is a good starting point, and it's a fair split. What do you think, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slight adjustment, but still fair and simple! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 20% decrease in my gain, but I'll consider Bob's new offer.

After recalculating, I realize that the total amount is now $8,000, and Bob's proposal is for me to get $5,000 and him to get $5,000. It's still an even split, but I was hoping for a bit more considering the initial amount was $10,000.

I'll decide to... {""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was an even split, I'll try to adjust my proposal to give me a slightly better share. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""A slight adjustment to give me a bit more, but still a fair deal!""}

I'm proposing that I get $5,500 and Bob gets $4,500. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob than my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think it's a good compromise 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my gains! 

I'll take a closer look at Bob's offer. He's proposing that I get $4,000 and he gets $6,000. Considering the drastic decrease in value due to inflation, I'm not thrilled about the gap between our shares. However, I'm willing to compromise.

I'll decide to... {""decision"": ""accept""}"
