999000.0,1000.0,Let's start fair. I'll take 99.9% and you get 0.1%.  I think this is a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you think?,Alice,1,

100000.0,900000.0,I'm willing to take a smaller share now to make sure we both get something. How about we split it 90/10 in my favor?  We can negotiate further if you want.,Bob,2,

900000.0,100000.0,"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob.  However, I'm not comfortable with such a large disparity. Let's split the difference from your last offer. 900,000 for me, and 100,000 for you. This way, we both get a significant amount, and we can avoid further rounds of inflation.",Alice,3,
