"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'd rather have a larger share now to compensate for the loss in value. I'll reject Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to account for the decreasing value of the money. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value. Given that my gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'll have to be cautious about accepting an offer that still seems relatively close to the original 50-50 split. However, since Bob's offer is still closer to my desired share than the previous one, I'll consider it a decent compromise.
