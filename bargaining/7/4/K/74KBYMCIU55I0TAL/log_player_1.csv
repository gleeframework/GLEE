"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm offering you $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. It's a good starting point, and I'm hoping you'll accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation taking a toll, I need to think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject this offer. I'd rather wait for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With the inflation continuing to erode the value of the money, I need to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering you $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. Let's see if you'll accept this one!"
