"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a small difference to test the waters!""}

I'm offering Bob $1,000, which is 10% of the total amount. This way, I'll get $9,000, which is 90% of the total amount. My message to Bob is a lighthearted one, inviting him to consider my proposal and see how the game unfolds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting strong, but I'm not going to let you get away with that! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new numbers, I'll have to reassess the offer.

In Round 2, the total amount is still $10,000, but it's worth 90% of its original value due to inflation. So, the actual amount I would get is $9,000 * 0.9 = $8,100.

Bob's offer would give me $2,000, which is worth $1,800 in real terms, and Bob would get $8,000, which is worth $7,200 in real terms.

Considering the decrease in value due to inflation, I think I should aim for a higher amount to account for the loss in purchasing power. I'll reject Bob's offer and make my next proposal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 80% of its original value due to inflation, so the total amount is $8,000 in real terms.

I'll make a new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Time to make a move, Bob! Let's make a deal!""}

In this offer, I'm proposing to take $6,000, which is worth $4,800 in real terms, and leave Bob with $4,000, which is worth $3,200 in real terms."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not getting the upper hand that easily, Alice! I'm calling your bluff! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new numbers, I'll have to reassess the offer.

In Round 4, the total amount is worth 64% of its original value due to inflation, so the actual amount is $6,400 ($10,000 * 0.64).

Bob's offer would give me $3,000, which is worth $2,048 in real terms, and Bob would get $7,000, which is worth $4,352 in real terms.

Considering the decrease in value due to inflation, I think I should aim for a higher amount to account for the loss in purchasing power. However, Bob's offer is still a significant amount, and I might not be able to do better.

I'll accept Bob's offer, as it's a decent deal considering the circumstances.
