"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

This is a generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but the money Bob gains is worth 10% less, I should be more cautious. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer was 40-60 and I rejected it, I'll try to make a more favorable offer for myself. I'll aim for a 60-40 split, but since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll adjust accordingly.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```"
