Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I rejected your offer to propose an even split. Let's be fair and end this quickly.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nIt seems that Bob's offer of an even split isn't quite fair, given the inflation that affects only my share. Let's see if I can negotiate a better deal in the next round.\n\n###\n\nNext, I'll make a new proposal to divide the money, taking into account the reduced value due to inflation. Here's my offer for Round 3:\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is more than fair!""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn, Bob!"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I am willing to be flexible, but inflation is hurting you more than me. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nIt seems that Bob's offer still doesn't account for the significant impact of inflation on my share. Given that he claims this is his final offer, I'll need to weigh the risks of rejecting it against the potential benefits of negotiating further.\n\n###\n\nHowever, with the money being worth 27.1% less for me, I need to consider the real value of what I'm getting. I'll calculate the actual worth to decide.\n\n###\n\nAfter calculating, I realize that 5200, after accounting for the 27.1% decrease in value, is actually less than what I'd like to settle for, especially considering Bob's share remains unaffected by inflation. I'll take a risk and reject this offer, hoping to negotiate a better deal in the next round.\n\n###\n\nHere's my decision:\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nNext, I'll make a new proposal to divide the money, taking into account the further reduced value due to inflation and the fact that Bob seems unwilling to budge much.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable.  I'm sticking with an even split.  This is the fairest option, especially considering the inflation working against you. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is significantly impacting the value of my share, and Bob's offer of an even split doesn't account for this disparity. Given the current state, an even split isn't as fair as Bob claims, considering I'm the only one affected by inflation.\n\n###\n\nHowever, with the game reaching its midpoint and the real value of the money decreasing rapidly for me, I need to reassess my strategy. Since Bob is sticking to an even split, I'll need to decide whether to accept this offer or try to negotiate further, risking the potential loss of value in subsequent rounds.\n\n###\n\nAfter careful consideration, I decide that accepting this offer might be the best option, given the rapidly decreasing value of my share. Here's my decision:\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI'm choosing to accept Bob's offer of an even split, despite the impact of inflation, to ensure I receive a share before the value decreases further.\n\n###\n\nLet's conclude the game with this decision."
