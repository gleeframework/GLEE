"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is a pretty generous offer, considering I'm offering Bob a significant share of the money right off the bat. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making a decision.

Since the money is worth 10% less now, my gain of $500,000 is equivalent to $450,000 in the first round's value. This is a decent offer, but I'm not sure if I should accept it.

I'll reject the offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less now (10% less than the previous round), my offer will be:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This offer is slightly more favorable to me, considering the decreasing value of the money. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is really losing value fast!

In this round, my gain of $400,000 is worth 72.9% of the original $1,000,000, which is approximately $729,000. Considering the rapidly decreasing value of the money, I think this is a relatively good offer for me.

I'll accept the offer.
