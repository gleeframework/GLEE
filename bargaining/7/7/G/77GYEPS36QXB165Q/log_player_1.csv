Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Come on, Alice! Since the money's worth is decreasing for you, let's split it in a way that's more favorable to me. I'm being generous here! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering the decreasing value of the money for you, I'm making a generous offer. Let's settle this! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to take advantage of my situation. While the value decreases for me each round, accepting a deal significantly worse than my initial offer puts me at a huge disadvantage. I need to hold out for a better offer, even if it means risking further inflation."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Bob, I'm compromising again.  This is a fair deal, let's wrap this up before we both lose out.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I need to signal willingness to negotiate while the offer is still somewhat reasonable. Bob is clearly trying to push his luck, but the longer this goes on, the worse it gets for me. This offer is a significant concession on my part, but it's still better than what Bob is offering."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, considering the rapidly decreasing value of the money for you, I'm making a final offer. Let's end this! 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision, but Bob's offer is still significantly skewed in his favor. He's clearly exploiting the inflation factor and banking on my desperation. Accepting this offer would mean losing a large portion of the potential gain. I'm willing to gamble on one more round, hoping Bob will come to his senses and negotiate a fairer deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 4600,
""bob_gain"": 5400,
""message"": ""Bob, this is my final offer. Take it or leave it.  I'm willing to accept a smaller share to end this now, but I won't be taken advantage of.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The situation is getting critical.  The value of the money is decreasing rapidly with each passing round. While Bob's offer in the previous round was unacceptable, I need to make a final move that shows I'm serious about reaching a deal but won't be exploited. This offer is my bottom line â€“ a significant concession, but still somewhat acceptable given the circumstances. Bob is likely to accept, realizing this is his last chance to secure a favorable deal before the decreasing value makes it pointless for me to continue."
