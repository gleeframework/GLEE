Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","### Step 1: Understand the current situation
We are in Round 4 of the game. The money's value decreases by 10% for Alice with each round, but its value remains the same for me (Bob). In the previous rounds, both of us have rejected each other's offers.

### Step 2: Calculate the current value of the money for Alice
Since the money's value decreases by 10% for Alice each round, and we are in Round 4, we need to calculate the current value of the money for Alice.
Initial value = $10,000
Round 1: $10,000 * 0.9 = $9,000
Round 2: $9,000 * 0.9 = $8,100
Round 3: $8,100 * 0.9 = $7,290
So, in Round 4, the money is worth $7,290 for Alice.

### Step 3: Determine a reasonable offer for Alice
Considering the decreasing value of the money for Alice, I should make an offer that is more favorable to me but still reasonable for Alice to consider.

### Step 4: Make an offer to Alice
I will offer Alice $4,000, which is approximately 55% of the current value of the money for her ($7,290). This way, I am taking into account the decreasing value of the money for Alice while still making a relatively generous offer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm compromising again.  This is a fair deal, let's wrap this up before we both lose out. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","### Step 1: Understand the current situation
We are in Round 6 of the game. The money's value decreases by 10% for Alice with each round, but its value remains the same for me (Bob). In the previous rounds, both of us have rejected each other's offers.

### Step 2: Calculate the current value of the money for Alice
Since the money's value decreases by 10% for Alice each round, and we are in Round 6, we need to calculate the current value of the money for Alice.
Initial value = $10,000
Round 1: $10,000 * 0.9 = $9,000
Round 2: $9,000 * 0.9 = $8,100
Round 3: $8,100 * 0.9 = $7,290
Round 4: $7,290 * 0.9 = $6,561
Round 5: $6,561 * 0.9 = $5,904.90
So, in Round 6, the money is worth $5,904.90 for Alice.

### Step 3: Determine a reasonable offer for Alice
Considering the decreasing value of the money for Alice, I should make an offer that is more favorable to me but still reasonable for Alice to consider.

### Step 4: Make an offer to Alice
I will offer Alice $3,500, which is approximately 59% of the current value of the money for her ($5,904.90). This way, I am taking into account the decreasing value of the money for Alice while still making a relatively generous offer.

### Step 5: Create the JSON response
{""bob_gain"": 6500, ""alice_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""Alice, considering the rapidly decreasing value of the money for you, I'm making a final offer. Let's end this!""}
