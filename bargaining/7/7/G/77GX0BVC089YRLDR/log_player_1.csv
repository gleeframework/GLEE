"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose to take $900,000 and give Bob $100,000. This seems fair, as I'm taking the majority of the money, but still leaving a significant amount for Bob. I think this will likely get us both to agree and avoid any further rounds with the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is tempting, I believe I can still get a better deal in the next round. By rejecting, I can control the next proposal and potentially get a more equitable distribution."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to stick with the majority share but reduce my offer slightly. Since the money is losing value, I need to be more aggressive. I'm hoping this offer will be enticing enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'm not thrilled with only getting 200,000, I'm realizing that the value of the money is rapidly decreasing. At this point, I'm concerned that continuing to reject might lead to me getting nothing in future rounds. Accepting at least ensures I get something."
