"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'm offering you a smaller share, but we can negotiate if you're not happy. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer is heavily skewed in Alice's favor. While she claims it's a starting point for negotiation, the penalty of inflation means time is on her side, not mine.  I need to signal I'm aiming for a much fairer split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""That offer wasn't reasonable.  I'm proposing a more equitable split. Let's avoid wasting time with heavily lopsided offers.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it closer to 50/50 this time. If we don't agree soon, we'll both lose money. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is using the threat of inflation, but her idea of compromise is still heavily in her favor.  We're getting close to the point where the penalty for waiting outweighs potential gains, but I think I can get her closer to a real 50/50 split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Time is running out. This is a reasonable offer slightly in my favor to compensate for the inflation we're BOTH facing.  Let's be sensible and end this.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're getting closer to an agreement.  I'm still willing to take a slightly smaller share, but let's get this done before we both lose more money. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is incredibly frustrating, as Alice is clearly taking advantage of the situation. However, the value of the deal is dropping rapidly for me. Accepting a 40/60 split now is better than risking getting nothing at all if we run out of rounds."
