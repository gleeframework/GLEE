"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, you can have a small share. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my share of $3000 is now worth $2700.

I don't think this is a good deal for me, as I'd be giving up a significant portion of the money. I'd like to reject this offer and see if I can do better.
