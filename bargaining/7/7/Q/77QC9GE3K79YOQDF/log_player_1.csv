"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 999,999,
  ""bob_gain"": 1,
  ""message"": ""Take the 1$ and let me have the rest!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a very small amount, trying to maximize my own gain in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Half and half, a fair start! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm taking the 200,000$ and ending the game."
