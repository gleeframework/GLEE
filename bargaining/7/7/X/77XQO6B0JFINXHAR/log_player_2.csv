"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair deal, Bob. You get a small share now, but we can negotiate better in the future. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

This is a risky game.  While Alice's offer seems fair on the surface, it's important to remember the inflation factor. I'm going to reject and see if I can get a better deal in the future."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, Alice. This way we both get a fair share before the money starts losing value.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a larger share, Bob, but I need to ensure I get a fair return for my initial offer. Let's be reasonable and avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd like to get more, I need to be realistic.  Alice is offering a good amount, and the money keeps losing value. Accepting this offer will secure a decent share for me before the inflation eats away more."
