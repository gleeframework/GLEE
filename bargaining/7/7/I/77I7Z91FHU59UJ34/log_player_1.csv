"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it 60-40. You'll still get a significant amount, and I'll get a bit more for coming up with the offer.""}\n\n### AI: Round 1\n\nPlease respond with Bob's decision and any message he wants to send back. Remember, if Bob rejects the offer, the money's value will decrease by 5% for Alice and 10% for Bob in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit too skewed in your favor. How about a slightly more balanced split this time? 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","### AI: Round 2\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nLet's see if we can get a better deal in the next round. Remember, the money's value will decrease again for both of us, but more so for Bob.\n\n### AI: Round 2\n\nPlease respond with the outcome of the rejection, and we'll proceed to the next round where I'll make a new offer.\n\n###\n\n(In the next round, I'll make sure to consider the decreasing value of the money for both of us.)"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### AI: Round 3\n\nConsidering the inflation, I'll try to find a balance that might appeal to Bob, given that the money's value is decreasing more significantly for him.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation is hitting you harder, I'm willing to meet closer to the middle, but I still believe I should get a bit more since I'm making the offer and the value is decreasing less for me.""}\n\n###\n\nLet's see how Bob reacts to this adjusted offer.\n\n###\n\nPlease respond with Bob's decision and any message he wants to send back.\n\n###\n\n(Remember, the stakes are getting lower with each round due to inflation, so the pressure to come to an agreement increases.)\n\n###\n\nAlso, keep in mind that in the next round, if Bob rejects this offer, the money will be worth even less for both of us, but the difference in the decrease will remain (5% less for me, 10% less for Bob).\n\n###\n\nThis game is not just about the division but also about the timing of the agreement to maximize the actual value received by each player.\n\n###\n\nLooking forward to Bob's response.\n\n###\n\nThis negotiation is getting interesting!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time here. This offer is a reasonable compromise, acknowledging the inflation we're both facing. 
# Alice gain: 53 
# Bob gain: 47 
Do you accept this offer?","### AI: Round 4\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nGiven the significant decrease in value for both of us, especially for Bob, and considering we're both losing value with each passing round, it seems prudent to accept this offer. The difference between our gains is minimal, and the risk of losing more value to inflation outweighs the potential benefits of negotiating further.\n\n###\n\nIt's time to finalize the agreement and walk away with what we have before the value drops even more.\n\n###\n\nPlease confirm the acceptance and the final outcome of the game.\n\n###\n\nI'm looking forward to concluding this negotiation and seeing how our decisions have impacted the final value we each receive."
