Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:** While my gains are worth less due to inflation, the offer is still significantly better than the previous round where I was offered only 2000. 
* **Risk:**  Rejecting this offer means I'll be making the proposal in the next round, but the inflation will hit me harder, making it even more difficult to get a good deal.  
* **Fairness:**  While I would prefer a more equal split, this offer is relatively fair given the circumstances."
