I propose a 90/10 split, giving me 900,000 and Bob 100,000.  It's a fair starting point, and I'm willing to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob's offer is not good for me. It's the reverse of my initial offer, and even though the inflation rate is different for us, I'm still losing a lot more. I'll counter with a different proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to reduce my share to 800,000 and give Bob 200,000.  This is a better offer for both of us as the money is worth less now due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low for me.  Even with the inflation, I'm still losing a significant portion of the money.  I will continue to try to negotiate a fairer deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}

I'm reducing my share again to 700,000, while offering Bob 300,000.  Inflation is hitting us both hard, so we need to compromise."
