"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $30, which is a relatively small amount, to see if he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less in the second round, my effective gain would be 65.4, which is still a decent amount.

However, Bob's offer of meeting in the middle is a reasonable one, and it seems like a good compromise. I'd rather not risk going into another round and potentially getting less.
