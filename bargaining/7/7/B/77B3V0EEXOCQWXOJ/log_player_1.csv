"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 3:1, I'll give you a good deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $250,000, which is a generous offer considering the total amount. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can finish the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair, given the upcoming inflation. Let's work together to maximize our gains. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 20% less, so I need to be more cautious.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that a 60/40 split is fair, especially considering the inflation factor. I want to try to negotiate a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve more given the risk of inflation. Let's try 60/40, but with me getting the larger share.""
}
```

I'm trying to take advantage of the fact that Bob made a similar offer in the previous round, and I'm hoping he'll be willing to accept a 60/40 split with me getting the larger share this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to move closer to your position, but I still believe a 55/45 split is more equitable. It's important we reach an agreement soon, as the value of our potential earnings continues to decline. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of my potential earnings is indeed declining rapidly due to inflation. I need to think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 4:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that a 55/45 split is fair, especially considering the significant decline in the value of my potential earnings. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share given the risks I'm taking. Let's try 55/45, but with me getting the larger share this time.""
}
```

I'm trying to mirror Bob's previous offer, but with a slight adjustment to give me the larger share. I'm hoping he'll be willing to accept this offer and we can finally reach an agreement."
