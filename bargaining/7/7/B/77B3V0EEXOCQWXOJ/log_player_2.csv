"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 3:1, I'll give you a good deal! 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While a 250,000$ gain is tempting, it's worth considering the potential for a better deal later.  The inflation means the value of the money will decrease in later rounds, so a slightly better deal later on might be more beneficial in the long run."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is fair, given the upcoming inflation. Let's work together to maximize our gains.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve more given the risk of inflation. Let's try 60/40, but with me getting the larger share. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While a 400,000$ gain is significant,  it's still less than the 600,000$ I initially offered.  Alice is trying to exploit the inflation, but I can still negotiate for a better deal. I'll reject this offer and try to secure a better split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to move closer to your position, but I still believe a 55/45 split is more equitable. It's important we reach an agreement soon, as the value of our potential earnings continues to decline.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share given the risks I'm taking. Let's try 55/45, but with me getting the larger share this time. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This offer represents a significant gain, and while it's not the ideal 60/40 split I initially proposed,  it's a reasonable compromise given the inflation and the limited rounds remaining. It's crucial to secure some money at this point, as the value of potential future offers continues to decrease rapidly."
