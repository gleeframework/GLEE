"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer leaves us both with a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While this is a fair offer, I'm going to see if I can get a better deal.  I'm hoping that the decreasing value of the money will encourage Alice to make a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""This offer is a bit more in my favor, but I think it's still a reasonable split.  Let's get this done before the money starts losing too much value!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a better deal than your last. The clock is ticking, let's be reasonable. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

Alice is offering a bit more, but it's still significantly less than what I had proposed. I'm hoping to get a more even split, and I'm willing to risk another round to try."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""This time, I'm proposing a 50/50 split.  It's the fairest way to divide the money, and it's getting too late to be greedy!  Let's agree to this and move on.""}
