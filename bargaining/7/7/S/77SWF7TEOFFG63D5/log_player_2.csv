"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting fair, but this is a game of strategy, so be prepared for things to change!

# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While it's tempting to take the guaranteed $100,000,  it's better to see what Alice's strategy is and see if I can get a better deal in the later rounds."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still aiming for a majority, but I'm willing to negotiate.  Let's see what you're really willing to do. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice is still aiming for a majority, and I'm not convinced I can't get a better deal if I keep playing.  The inflation is hurting, but I'm still hopeful."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.

Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
