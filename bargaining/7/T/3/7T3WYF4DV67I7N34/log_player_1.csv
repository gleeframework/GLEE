"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm offering to give Bob 40% of the initial $100, which is $40. This leaves me with $60, which is a decent amount considering the potential for inflation. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, my gain is worth 20% less, so the $60 I would have gotten in the first round is now worth $48. Considering Bob's offer, I would get $30, which is a smaller share of the remaining value.

I'll reject this offer and wait for the next round. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the effects of inflation, I'll aim to get a larger share of the remaining value. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

This time, I'm offering Bob a smaller share, but I'm hoping to get a larger share of the remaining value."
