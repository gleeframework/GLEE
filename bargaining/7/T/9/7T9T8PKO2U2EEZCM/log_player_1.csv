"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. This is a generous offer considering I am taking a much smaller hit from the inflation than Bob.  Let's see if he is reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is insulting. He's trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I'm not going to let him get away with it.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to stick with a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a fair compromise considering the inflation and Bob's previous attempt to lowball me."
