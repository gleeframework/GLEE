"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This offer gives me a larger share, as I am the first to propose and want to maximize my potential gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation will make it increasingly difficult to get a better deal. Accepting this offer ensures a reasonable gain, even with the inflation taken into account."
