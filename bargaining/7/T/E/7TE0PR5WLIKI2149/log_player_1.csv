Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive offer, keeping 99% of the money for myself. I figure Bob might be tempted to accept since he's getting something rather than nothing. However, I also want to see how he reacts to this initial offer.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer to keep a larger share, Bob's offer is a fair split considering the inflation factor. It's better to accept now and avoid the risk of getting nothing in later rounds."
