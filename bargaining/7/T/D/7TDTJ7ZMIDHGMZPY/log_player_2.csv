"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm Bob, and I'm feeling greedy. Let's see if I can get a better deal! ðŸ˜‰"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than an even split. Let's see if you agree.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share this time, but I'm still open to negotiation. Let's find a compromise. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a bigger share, Alice is starting to get a much worse deal due to inflation. Accepting this offer guarantees me a decent amount of money, and the risk of losing even more by rejecting and waiting for my turn is not worth it."
