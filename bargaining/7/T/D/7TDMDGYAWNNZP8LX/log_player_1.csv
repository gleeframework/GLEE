"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take the majority! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to take the majority, huh?

I'll reject this offer since it's not in my favor. I'd rather wait for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""A bit more for me, but still a decent offer!""
}
```

I'm trying to take a slightly larger share this time, but still leaving Bob with a substantial amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being a bit greedy, meet me in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks I'm being greedy, does he?

Actually, this offer is quite similar to the one I made in round 2, but with a slight adjustment. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'm not as opposed to this offer as I was before.
