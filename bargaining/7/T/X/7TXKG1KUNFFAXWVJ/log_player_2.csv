# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly trying to pressure me, but I'm running out of time to bargain for a better split. I need to apply more pressure, and rejecting this offer does that.  I'll likely have to concede more in the next round or two."

Round 8

{""bob_gain"": 5300, ""alice_gain"": 4700, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances.  Take it before the money shrinks even more!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm conceding slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate, but still aiming for a slight advantage.  The message is framed to emphasize the time pressure and imply this is my final offer."

# Bob gain: 4900 
# Alice gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  The inflation is killing me, and Alice knows it.  While this isn't a great deal, getting only $4,900 is much better than getting nothing if we run out of rounds. It's time to cut my losses and accept."
