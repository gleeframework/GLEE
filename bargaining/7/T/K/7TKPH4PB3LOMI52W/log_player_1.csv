"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $20, which is 20% of the original $100, and keeping $80 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more balanced split is better for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I need to reassess the offer.

For Round 2, my gain of $40 is worth 90% of the original $80, which is $72. Bob's gain of $60 is worth 80% of the original $20, which is $16.

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, considering the reduced value of my gain. I'd like to think about it for a moment...

I decide to reject this offer. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll make a new offer. Since Bob's gain was $60 in the previous round, I'll try to offer him a smaller share this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Meet in the middle, let's compromise""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $50, which is a 50/50 split, and keeping $50 for myself."
