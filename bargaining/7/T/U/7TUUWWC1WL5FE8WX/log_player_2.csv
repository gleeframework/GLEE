"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split the money almost evenly. This offer benefits both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nSince the money loses 20% of its value for me with each passing round, I want to try and get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nSince I'm trying to get a better deal, and the money loses value for me with each round, I'll aim for a higher share in this round but still try to be somewhat reasonable to avoid immediate rejection.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation impact on me, I believe this split is more fair.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is literally money for you with this inflation. Let's meet in the middle for a quick agreement. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nGiven the increasing impact of inflation, which now reduces the value of the money I gain by 36%, I need to reassess what constitutes a favorable deal. Alice's offer of $4800 to me and $5200 to her seems more attractive under these conditions, especially considering that further rounds will only decrease the value of my potential gains. Accepting this offer now may be more beneficial than risking further devaluation.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI've decided to accept Alice's offer to minimize further loss due to inflation."
