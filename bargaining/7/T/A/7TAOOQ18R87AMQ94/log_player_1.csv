I'm going for a 60/40 split in my favor. This seems like a fair starting point, considering the inflation dynamic that favors me more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I would prefer a larger share,  the inflation dynamic is making it less worthwhile to keep playing. Accepting this offer ensures I get some money, and the inflation will continue to eat away at its value if I reject it."
