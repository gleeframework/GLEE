"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept and we can call it a day!""
}
```

This is a generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it quickly so we can both get our share of the money!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, a fair deal! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to split it 50/50? That's a pretty reasonable offer, but I was hoping to get a bit more. However, I don't want to risk going to 12 rounds and getting nothing, so I'll accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
