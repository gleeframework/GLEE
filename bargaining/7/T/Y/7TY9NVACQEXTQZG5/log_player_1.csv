"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $100, which is $40, and keeping 60% for myself, which is $60."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'm hoping to do better in future rounds! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustments, the money I gain in Round 2 is worth 20% less than in Round 1, so I'll receive $48 (20% of $60 is $12, and $60 - $12 = $48). The money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in Round 1, so he'll receive $76 (80% of $100 is $80, and $80 - 5% of $80 is $76).

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Too low, I'm hoping for a better share!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer in Round 2 was 20 for me and 80 for him, I'll try to increase my share. Due to inflation, the money is worth 20% less than in Round 2, so I'll aim to get a higher percentage of the remaining amount.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's make a deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 55% of the remaining $100, which is $55, and keeping 45% for myself, which is $45."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm trying to maximize my gain, but I'm willing to give you a small share 
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation.

Since the money is worth 20% less each round, after 3 rounds, the money is worth 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.512 of its original value. So, the actual value of the money in Round 4 is $100 * 0.512 = $51.20.

With the inflation adjustments, the money I gain in Round 4 is worth 48.8% less than in Round 1, so I'll receive $30.24 (15% of $51.20 is $7.68, and $51.20 - $7.68 = $43.52, but since the money is worth 48.8% less, the actual value is $43.52 * 0.512 = $22.24 + $7.68 = $30.24). The money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, so he'll receive $85.90 (85% of $100 is $85, and $85 - 14.26% of $85 is $85.90).

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Still too low, I'm not willing to give up that much!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer in Round 4 was 15 for me and 85 for him, I'll try to increase my share again. Due to inflation, the money is worth 20% less each round, so I'll aim to get a higher percentage of the remaining amount.

Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 30,
  ""bob_gain"": 70,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a bit more!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 70% of the remaining $100, which is $70, and keeping 30% for myself, which is $30."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging, take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation.

Since the money is worth 20% less each round, after 5 rounds, the money is worth 0.8^5 = 0.32768 of its original value. So, the actual value of the money in Round 6 is $100 * 0.32768 = $32.768.

With the inflation adjustments, the money I gain in Round 6 is worth 67.23% less than in Round 1, so I'll receive $16.15 (10% of $32.768 is $3.27768, and $32.768 - $3.27768 = $29.49032, but since the money is worth 67.23% less, the actual value is $29.49032 * 0.32768 = $9.69 + $3.27768 = $12.96768, rounding to $13.00). The money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round, so he'll receive $89.22 (90% of $100 is $90, and $90 - 22.62% of $90 is $89.22).

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""This is getting ridiculous, I'm not giving up that much!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer in Round 6 was 10 for me and 90 for him, I'll try to increase my share again. Due to inflation, the money is worth 20% less each round, so I'll aim to get a higher percentage of the remaining amount.

Here's my proposal for Round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 25,
  ""bob_gain"": 75,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, but I'll try one last time!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 75% of the remaining $100, which is $75, and keeping 25% for myself, which is $25."
