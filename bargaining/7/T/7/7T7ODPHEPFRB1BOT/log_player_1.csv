"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to begin with. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you most of it, but I still want something! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With Bob's offer, I would gain $70, which is worth the same as in the first round, and Bob would gain $30, which is 20% less than the $37.5 he would have gained in the first round.

I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure if I want to give Bob such a significant advantage, especially considering the inflation factor. I'd like to make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a decent share, but I want to keep some for myself!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a bit more in my favor this time. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you most of it, but I'm getting desperate! 
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob's getting desperate! With inflation, Bob's gain of $20 is worth 48.8% less than the $37.5 he would have gained in the first round.

I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure if I want to give Bob such a small share, even if he's getting desperate. I'd like to make another counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which is a bit more balanced this time. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
