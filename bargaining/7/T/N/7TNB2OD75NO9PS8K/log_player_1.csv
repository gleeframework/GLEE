"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```
This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it to get a decent share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll think carefully about this offer. With inflation eating away at the value of the money, I'll need to be strategic. Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```
I'm trying to be more aggressive this time, taking a larger share of the money to compensate for the effects of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is dropping rapidly due to inflation! I need to be careful not to get too greedy.

After considering Bob's offer, I think it's a good opportunity to take what I can get. The money is worth significantly less now, and I'd rather have something than risk going home with nothing.
