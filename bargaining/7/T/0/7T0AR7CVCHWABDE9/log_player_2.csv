"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, Bob. I take $60 and you get $40.  A deal's better than nothing if we keep going! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI think I can get a better deal if I wait. Besides, $40 is not that much, and I'm willing to take the risk of the money being worth a little less in the next round. Bring it on!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'll take a bit more, since you wanted to take more in the first round. $55 for me, $45 for you. It's still better for you than getting nothing if we can't agree!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's be reasonable. I'll take a little less this time - $55 for me and $45 for you.  We need to agree soon! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI already offered her $45 in the previous round, and now she's offering me the same amount? I don't think so! The money might be worth a little less now, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 57, ""alice_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""You didn't accept my previous offer, and now the money is worth less. I'll take a bit more this time - $57 for me, $43 for you. We need to agree soon, or we'll both end up with nothing!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. We're losing money with every round! Let's just split it 50/50 and call it a day. A fair deal is better than risking getting zero! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nFinally, a reasonable offer! With the money worth 18.55% less than in the first round, I think it's time to accept a fair deal. 50/50 is a good split, and I don't want to risk getting nothing if we can't agree soon. Let's shake on it and end this game!"
