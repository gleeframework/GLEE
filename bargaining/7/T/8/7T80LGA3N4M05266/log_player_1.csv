"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take more 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the value of the money I gain to be $50. With Bob's offer, I'd get $40, which is less than my initial offer of $50. I'll reject this offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, and I rejected Bob's offer, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money. I'll aim for a slightly higher percentage for myself to compensate for the inflation.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Compromise, but I'm not getting any younger""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging, take it or leave it 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money! Since the money I gain is still worth $50, I'll consider Bob's offer. With Bob's offer, I'd get $45, which is less than my initial offer of $50. However, considering the decreasing value of the money, I'll think about it carefully.
