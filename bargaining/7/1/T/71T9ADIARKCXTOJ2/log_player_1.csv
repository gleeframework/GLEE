"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

This is my first offer. Bob will get $300,000 and I'll get $700,000. What will he say?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

It's not a bad offer, but I'm hoping for a better deal. What's Bob's next move?"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In round 3, the money is worth 20% less than in round 2 for me, and 10% less than in round 2 for Bob. My offer is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000
}
```

This is my new proposal. Bob will get $460,000 and I'll get $540,000. Will he accept this offer?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 48.8% less for me and 27.1% less for Bob, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'll accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

It's a 50/50 split, which is a fair deal considering the significant inflation that's been affecting the money's value. I'll take it!"
