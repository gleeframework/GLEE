"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 40% for me and 60% for you is a more reasonable starting point, considering we both want a share and the money's value decreases each round. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
