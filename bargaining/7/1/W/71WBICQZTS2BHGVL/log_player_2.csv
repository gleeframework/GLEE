Alice is trying to wear me down with the threat of inflation, but I still have some rounds to play.  I need to signal I'm willing to accept something more realistic than 50/50, but not this low."

This is getting dangerous.  Alice is clearly aware of how inflation is impacting my returns. While not ideal, taking $3,500 is better than walking away with nothing if this drags on and she continues lowballing me."
