I'm starting with a pretty aggressive offer, hoping Bob will accept it. I figure a 90/10 split is fair, considering I'm the one proposing first and the risk of inflation is on me.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob is being greedy! I'm not going to accept that offer. I'll wait for my chance to propose again."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

Okay, I'm lowering my offer slightly to 80/20.  Since inflation is now a factor, I need to be more cautious.  Hopefully, Bob will recognize that this is still a fair offer, especially considering he rejected my previous proposal."
