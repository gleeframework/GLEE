Round 2

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 58

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Okay Alice, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest option.  Every round that passes hurts my share more than yours.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a tiny bit more, but I'm not going for 50/50. You're getting desperate, I can wait 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly playing a game of chicken, betting on my fear of inflation to force me into a bad deal.  While 43$ isn't terrible, I need to show strength and make it clear I'm willing to risk it all for a fair offer. If she continues this pattern, I may have to accept a less favorable deal in later rounds, but I'm hoping this firm rejection will bring her closer to 50/50."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm being reasonable. You can take a slight advantage, but this needs to end soon.  Let's be fair, let's be practical.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conceding slightly:**  Alice is unlikely to accept 50/50 at this point. Offering 48/52 shows I'm willing to compromise but still want a reasonably fair deal. 
* **Time pressure:** Reminding Alice about the dwindling time emphasizes the cost of waiting. 
* **Avoiding desperation:**  While the situation is getting worse, I don't want to appear desperate.  I'm making a reasonable offer, not begging."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, Bob. I'll give you a tiny bit more than before, but that's it 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly enjoying this game of chicken, but her incremental increases are insulting. Accepting now would be admitting defeat and letting her walk away with a significantly larger share.  The risk is increasing, but I'm hoping that rejecting this offer, which is barely better than her last, will make her realize I'm serious about getting a reasonable deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 47, ""alice_gain"": 53, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. I'm taking a significant hit with each round, and you're barely budging.  Meet me in the middle, or this will benefit neither of us.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Shifting blame:** I'm subtly shifting the blame for the impasse onto Alice, highlighting her stubbornness.
* **Emphasizing mutual loss:**  I'm reminding her that letting the game continue with no agreement hurts both of us, even if it hurts me more.
* **Small concession:** Offering 47/53 is a small concession, but it might be enough to get her to finally engage in meaningful negotiation. It's still better than accepting her 44/56 offer.
* **Urgency:** I'm not explicitly stating the dwindling rounds, but the overall tone conveys a sense of urgency."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 83.22% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting desperate, Bob. I'll stick to my guns. This is my final 'generous' offer 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The situation has become critical. While 45/55 is far from ideal, rejecting this offer carries a huge risk. Alice seems firm, and the next few rounds will erode my potential gains significantly. If we don't settle now, I might be forced to accept an even worse offer later, potentially getting less than 45. It's painful, but accepting this offer guarantees me something rather than risking getting nothing at all."
