"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair, but slightly advantageous for me, split.  I'm sure we can find a better solution for both of us later. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
This is a good deal for Alice, but it's not a great deal for Bob. There are 12 rounds left, and the money depreciates for Bob, so he'll have to push for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
