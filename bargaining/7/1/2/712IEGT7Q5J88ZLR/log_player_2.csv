I'm going to reject this offer. While it's tempting to take something now, I want to see if I can get a better deal in the next round. Remember, the money is worth less to me with each passing round, so I need to be careful!"

I'm still going to reject this offer.  Even though the inflation is starting to hurt, I think I can still get a better deal if I wait. I'm starting to feel like Alice is being stubborn, so hopefully, the next round will be more favorable for me."

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still going to reject this offer. Even though the inflation is hitting hard now, I'm not convinced Alice will give me a better deal later.  I'm going to play it safe and see if I can squeeze out a bit more in the next round."

# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm going to accept this offer. The inflation is really starting to hurt now, and I'm worried I won't get anything if I keep rejecting.  It's not ideal, but at least I'm getting something."
