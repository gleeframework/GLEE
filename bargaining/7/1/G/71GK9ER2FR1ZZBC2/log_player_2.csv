"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a better share than 40%.  Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is getting better, but it's still heavily skewed in her favor. The inflation is hurting her much more than me, so I'm willing to gamble that she'll become more reasonable in the next round."
