"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the original $100, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, I'll need to adjust my strategy.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the 40% loss in value due to inflation from the first round.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 52,
  ""bob_gain"": 48
}
```

This way, I'm aiming to get a bit more than half of the remaining value."
