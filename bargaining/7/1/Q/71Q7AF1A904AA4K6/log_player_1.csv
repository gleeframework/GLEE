Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a pretty generous offer to Bob. This is a high-stakes game, and I want to see if he's willing to play cooperatively.  If he rejects this, I'll need to adjust my strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer to get more, Bob's offer is fair and a significant improvement over my original proposal.  The inflation is a serious factor, and it's better to take a guaranteed 500,000 than risk getting nothing in the remaining rounds."
