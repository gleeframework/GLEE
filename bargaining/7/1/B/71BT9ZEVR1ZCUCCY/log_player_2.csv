"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is a fair starting point, Bob. Let's not lose money to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While this is a fair starting point, Bob can likely get a better deal. It's too early to accept and risk losing money to inflation.  Let's see what Alice's next offer will be."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to split the difference.  Let's make a deal and avoid any further loss to inflation."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. A 50/50 split is the fairest option. Time is running out! 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While a 50/50 split isn't ideal, it's the best I can likely get at this point.  Time is running out and accepting ensures we both get something."
