"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share, I'll give you a small amount to test the waters.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $70 and Bob gets $30. My message is a friendly one, inviting Bob to consider the offer and see if we can come to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, I'll give you a fair share, and we can end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, my gain of $45 is now worth less than I initially thought.

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept the terms just yet. I'll wait for a better offer or try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, a 50/50 split is a fair compromise.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping to find a middle ground and end the game quickly."
