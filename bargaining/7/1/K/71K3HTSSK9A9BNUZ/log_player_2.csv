"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take the bigger share this round, but you can have the advantage next time. We'll see how inflation plays out. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's proposal is tempting in the short term, it's risky to rely on her promise of an advantage in the next round. The inflation factor is unknown, and accepting now means losing out on a potentially much larger share later on.  It's better to play it safe and see what Alice proposes in the next round."
