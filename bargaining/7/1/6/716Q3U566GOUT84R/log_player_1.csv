"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}

I'm offering Bob $40, which is a relatively generous offer, considering the game is just starting and the stakes are high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting already!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'd like to get a bigger share to compensate for the loss in value. However, Bob's offer is 50-50, which is a fair split, but considering the inflation, I'd rather not accept it.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation is still affecting my gains, I'll aim to get a higher share to make up for it. Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my gains! With my money being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I need to be more aggressive in my negotiations.

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a bit too skewed towards him, given the current value of money. I'd like to get a better deal. However, I also don't want to risk going too low, as the rounds are running out.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","The inflation is really eating away at my potential gains! With my money being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I need to be even more aggressive in my offer.

Here's my new proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}

I'm taking a risk by offering a relatively small share to Bob, but I think it's necessary to account for the significant devaluation of my potential gains due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really devastating my potential gains! With my money being worth 67.23% less than in the first round, I'm in a very difficult position.

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a relatively fair split, given the circumstances. I'm not getting a great deal, but I don't want to risk going to the next round with the money being even less valuable.
