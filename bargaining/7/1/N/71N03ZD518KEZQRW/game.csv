,,,Bob,1,reject
4750.0,5250.0,"Your offer was a bit too greedy Alice. Let's split it more fairly, with a slight advantage for me to make up for the inflation.",Bob,2,
,,"That's a very small compensation for the inflation, Bob. I'm sure we can find a more balanced solution.",Alice,2,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Okay, Bob, let's try this. I get $5,500, you get $4,500.  This accounts for the inflation while still giving us both a decent share.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Alice, this back and forth is pointless. Let's just split it evenly and call it a day. 50/50.",Bob,4,
,,"Alright Bob, you got a deal. 50/50 it is.",Alice,4,accept
