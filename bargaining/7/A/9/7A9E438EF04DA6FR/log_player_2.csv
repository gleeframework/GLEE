Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting closer, let's settle on this 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of inflation and is moving closer to a more even split.  However, time is also running out for me (Bob). I'll hold out a bit longer to see if I can secure a slightly better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4800,
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer.  Let's be reasonable and end this.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** With only 6 rounds left, the pressure is on both of us. Alice is losing value with each round, and I risk getting nothing if we don't agree soon.
* **Strategic Concession:** I'm conceding slightly from my previous offer to show willingness to compromise, but this is my bottom line. 
* **Firmness:** The ""final offer"" statement adds weight and signals that I'm serious about reaching an agreement now."
