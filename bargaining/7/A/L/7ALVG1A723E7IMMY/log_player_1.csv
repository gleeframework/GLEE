I'm proposing a 9000/1000 split in my favor, Alice. I figure it's a good starting point, and I'm confident I can get a better deal if we keep going.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

A 50/50 split is fair, and I'd rather not risk getting nothing by continuing."
