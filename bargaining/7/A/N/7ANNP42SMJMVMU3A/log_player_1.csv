"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000 and keeping $9,000 for myself. This is a relatively generous offer, so I hope Bob will accept!"

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, let's try to find a middle ground! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less, the new amounts are:

* Alice's gain: 3000 * 0.95 = 2850
* Bob's gain: 7000 * 0.95 = 6650

I'm not too thrilled about this offer, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think I can do better than this!"
