Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a more equitable split this time. Let's be fair to each other. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5800,
""bob_gain"": 4200,
""message"": ""Bob, time is literally money! Let's settle this now. This is my final offer.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency:** Emphasizing the time pressure and inflation is crucial. Bob needs to understand that delaying is in *his* best interest, not mine. 
* **Slight Concession:** I've reduced my share slightly to make the offer appear more appealing, but not so much that it significantly hurts me if accepted. 
* **Finality:** By stating it's my final offer, I'm increasing pressure. Bob now knows if he rejects this, I'm likely to accept a less favorable deal in later rounds due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is a reasonable offer considering the circumstances. Let's close the deal and avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Inflation:**  The money is losing value rapidly. Accepting even a less favorable deal now is better than risking even greater losses in future rounds.
* **Bob's Likely Strategy:** Bob is likely to keep pushing for a slightly larger share with each round, knowing the inflation hurts me more.
* **Minimizing Losses:** Accepting this offer cuts my losses. Holding out for a marginally better deal in a later round might backfire if Bob continues to play hardball."
