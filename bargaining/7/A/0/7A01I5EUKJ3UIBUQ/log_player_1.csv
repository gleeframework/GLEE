"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money in a 3:1 ratio. This might seem a bit lopsided, but consider the decreasing value of money with each round.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60:40 split is fair, considering the inflation. It's a bit more equitable than your last offer, and it leaves us both with a decent share. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
