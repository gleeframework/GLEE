"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which means I'll get $6,000 and Bob will get $4,000. I think this is a reasonable offer, considering the game is just starting and I'm taking the risk of proceeding to the next round."
