"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can end this game quickly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but it's still a decent amount. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not as generous as you thought, are you? Let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to take advantage of the situation!

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not going to accept an offer that gives me less than I offered in the first round, especially when I'm already getting hit with inflation. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob! Let's split it fairly this time!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise that's more reasonable, considering the inflation. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I'm not quite there yet. Keep trying! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is still trying to get the better deal!

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept an offer that's still biased towards Bob, even if it's closer to the middle ground. I'll keep trying to find a fairer split!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```

  ""message"": ""Let's split it almost exactly down the middle, Bob! Is that fair enough?""
}
```

I'm trying to find a more precise middle ground, considering the inflation. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
