Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fairer.  It's a compromise that recognizes your earlier proposal but also gives me a bit more of the pie.  Let's work together to avoid inflation eating away at our earnings. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55
