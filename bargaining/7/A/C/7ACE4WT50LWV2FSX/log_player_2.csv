Round 2

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 4

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You should have taken my previous offer, now it's even less 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation to her advantage. While the deal is getting worse, accepting $40 is a terrible outcome.  I need to firmly push for a fairer resolution, even if it means risking another round.  It's better to get a smaller amount fairly than be strong-armed into a bad deal."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""This is my final offer.  Take it or leave it - I'd rather lose money to inflation than be taken advantage of.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's clear Alice is going to be extremely tough.  I'm offering a deal that's still in her favor, but closer to a fair split. This puts the pressure on her.  If she rejects it, she risks getting a worse deal in the following rounds, especially considering the inflation working against me. This is a calculated risk to try and salvage a somewhat reasonable outcome."
