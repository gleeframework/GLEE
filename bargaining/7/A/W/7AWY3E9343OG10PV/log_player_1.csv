I'm going to start with a pretty generous offer, hoping Bob will be happy to take it.  I'll take the lion's share, but I'm leaving him a decent amount. Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is insulting!  He's basically trying to flip the script on me after I was so generous. I'm not going to fall for that. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer a bit, but I still want to leave Bob with a decent amount.  He rejected my offer last round, so hopefully he'll realize he needs to compromise a little."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is getting more and more greedy! He's clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I'm not going to let him. I'm still going to fight for a fair share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm starting to get a little worried about the inflation, but I'm still confident I can get a fair share. I'm going to try one more time to find a compromise, but this time I'm going to take a larger portion for myself."
