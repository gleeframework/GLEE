Alice is still trying to push for a significant advantage.  The devaluation is starting to become a factor, but it's better to hold out a bit longer and aim for a more equitable split."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking, and we're both losing money. I'm standing firm at 50/50.  Let's be smart and take this deal.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

-  **Time Pressure:** With each round, the value of the money decreases significantly. It's crucial to reach an agreement quickly.
- **Firm Stance:** By sticking to 50/50, Bob demonstrates seriousness about a fair deal and unwillingness to be exploited.
- **Finality:**  The phrase ""take it or leave it"" emphasizes the urgency of the situation and encourages Alice to make a decision."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the urgency, but I'm not ready to settle for 50/50. How about 58-42? 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

It's painful to accept anything less than 50/50, but the time pressure is immense now.  With each round, the potential gains are shrinking dramatically. Accepting 420,000 now is better than risking getting nothing in a few rounds, or accepting an even worse offer from Alice later."
