"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80/20, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 2,000$ and keeping 8,000$ for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's compromise and meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, but I'm still eager to get a share.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
