I'm going to start with a pretty generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a quick deal and avoid inflation. Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While a 50/50 split seems fair, the inflation is a major concern. It's better to risk another round and potentially get a better deal later."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm still aiming for a larger share, but recognizing Bob's rejection of my previous offer, I'm reducing my proposed gain by 1000. This should show him that I'm willing to negotiate, while still securing a good deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. Inflation is hitting hard, and while I'm losing value, it's not enough to make me accept this offer. I still believe I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm still trying to get a majority share, but I'm making a significant concession to Bob. I'm lowering my gain by another 1000, hoping that this will finally sway him and avoid further inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Inflation is really hitting hard, and while I'm losing value, I'm not giving up yet.  I believe there's still a chance for a better deal for me.  I'm rejecting Bob's offer and hoping to get a better proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

Inflation is really hurting now, but I'm still holding out for a better deal. This offer is a compromise - I'm taking a significant hit, but I'm still hoping to get a majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. Even though inflation is significantly impacting the value of the money, I still believe there's potential for a better deal. I'm going to try to secure a larger share in the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm going to try a 50/50 split. We're both losing a lot of value due to inflation, so I think a fair split is the best option to avoid getting nothing at all."
