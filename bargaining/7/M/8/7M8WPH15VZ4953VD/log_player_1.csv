"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start to our negotiations!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but still a decent offer. Your turn to respond! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Too skewed in your favor, Bob! I'm looking for a more even split.""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because it's not balanced enough in my favor. I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, the money is worth less now. I'll make a new offer that takes that into account.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping a bit more for myself. Now it's up to Bob to decide what to do next!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I'm not going to back down. You can try to do better! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really eating away at the value of the money!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""No way, Bob! That's way too skewed in your favor. I'm not giving up yet!""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because it's not even close to a fair split. I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation really taking a toll on the money's value, I'll make a new offer that takes that into account.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 360000,
  ""bob_gain"": 640000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a fair share. Can we meet in the middle?""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping a bit more for myself. I'm hoping this will be a more acceptable offer for Bob."
