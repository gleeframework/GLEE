I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. I'm hoping to get a good chunk of the money and secure a deal quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is a much better offer than what I could get in the next round with the inflation.  I'll take the 500,000."
