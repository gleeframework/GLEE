"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. No need for inflation adjustments yet, we have plenty of time. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""I understand you want an even split, but inflation will hurt you more than me. I'm lowering my demand slightly.""

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm sticking with my previous offer. Let's be fair, and if we can't agree, we'll both lose money. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is sticking to his guns, accepting a 50/50 split now means losing out on potential gains later.  Even though time is ticking, Bob's perception of a fair deal is increasingly skewed by the inflation working against him. I need to hold out for a better offer."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5100,
""bob_gain"": 4900,
""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be reasonable. This is a compromise, and it accounts for the inflation working against you.""

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time.  We both lose if we don't agree.  Let's split it evenly and end this game. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Time is becoming a serious factor now. While a 50/50 split isn't ideal, Bob is unlikely to budge further, and I risk us both walking away with nothing if I keep pushing. It's better to secure a guaranteed win at this point than gamble on getting a slightly better deal in the remaining rounds."
