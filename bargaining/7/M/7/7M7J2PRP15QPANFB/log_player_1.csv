Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a relatively generous offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can both get something quickly.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse for me than my initial offer, even with the inflation factored in.  I'll reject and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm going to stick with a fairly even split, but increase my share slightly to account for inflation.  Hopefully this is enticing enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even with the inflation, Bob's offer is still too lopsided in his favor. I'll reject it and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm going to increase my share again to compensate for the inflation, but I'll still offer Bob a reasonable amount. I think a 70/30 split is fair considering the current inflation rates."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even with the significant inflation, Bob's offer is still extremely unfair. I'll reject it and hope to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm going to push for a bigger share, but I'll still try to be reasonable. With the current inflation, I'm going to offer Bob a 20/80 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is simply not worth it. Even with the massive inflation, a single dollar is not enough to make it worthwhile. I will reject and see if I can get a better deal next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm going to push for a 90/10 split this round. While it's still a big chunk of the money going to me, I think it's the most reasonable offer considering the current inflation rates and Bob's increasingly unfavorable offers.  Let's see if he accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 86.58% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 0 
# Bob gain: 100 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I can't accept that offer. Even with the massive inflation, getting nothing at all is not a good outcome. It's clear that Bob is taking advantage of the situation, but I won't let him completely rob me. I'll reject and hope for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5}
```

It's clear Bob is being greedy, but I'm going to try and be fair while still maximizing my gains. This offer is  a bit of a gamble - but with inflation so high, it's the best shot I have to get something close to a fair split."
