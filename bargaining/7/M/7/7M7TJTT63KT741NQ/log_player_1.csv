I'm going for a strong opening offer, aiming for 90% of the money.  Let's see if Bob is willing to accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, taking 5000 now is better than risking nothing in the later rounds. With the inflation factor, my gains will decrease drastically if we continue.  Let's take the 50/50 split."
