"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering you $400,000, and I'll take $600,000. It's a fair starting point, and I'm hoping you'll accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth 20% less this round, I'll have to consider that when evaluating the offer. If I accept this offer, I'll get $500,000, which is worth 80% of the original $600,000 I was offered in the first round. That's a decent trade-off, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject this offer for now.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 40% of its original value now (80% of 80% = 64%), I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value.

Here's my offer for round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 640000,
  ""bob_gain"": 360000
}
```

I'm offering you $360,000, and I'll take $640,000. It's a bit more aggressive, but I think it's a good balance considering the reduced value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is getting less valuable by the round!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll evaluate Bob's offer. If I accept this offer, I'll get $450,000, which is worth 45% of the original $600,000 I was offered in the first round (80% of 56.25% = 45%). That's a decent trade-off, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject this offer for now.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","The money is worth 51.2% of its original value now (80% of 63.75% = 51.2%). I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value.

Here's my offer for round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000
}
```

I'm offering you $480,000, and I'll take $520,000. It's a relatively balanced offer, considering the reduced value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is getting really devalued now!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll evaluate Bob's offer. If I accept this offer, I'll get $400,000, which is worth 40% of the original $600,000 I was offered in the first round (80% of 50% = 40%). That's a relatively small share, but I'm starting to get desperate with only a few rounds left.

I'll accept this offer.
