"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair and reasonable start""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I'll get 6,000 and Bob will get 4,000. I think this is a good starting point, and I hope Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better. Let's split it 60-40, with me getting the larger share. It's fair to reflect the effort I put in to make this happen. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not happy about Bob trying to take the larger share, but I'll consider it.

Since the money is worth 20% less, I'll need to adjust my thinking. Considering the reduced value of the money, I think Bob's offer is a bit too generous to me.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 55-45, a more balanced split considering the reduced value of the money""}

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, where I'll get 5,500 and Bob will get 4,500. I think this is a more reasonable compromise, taking into account the reduced value of the money due to inflation."
