"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see what Alice proposes next!  I'm sure I can get a better deal. ðŸ˜‰"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I think we can both do better, but this is my best offer for now.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle, considering the inflation 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though Alice is getting more, considering the inflation and the fact that I can't guarantee a better offer in the next round, I'll take it."
