{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""My turn to propose a fairer split. Take this offer before inflation eats your share!""

Let's see if Alice accepts this offer. I'm aiming high, considering her money is losing value faster than mine."

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, meet me in the middle 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice's offer is getting closer to a more reasonable split, but it's still not good enough.  The effects of inflation are becoming more significant, so she'll be feeling more pressure to make a better deal soon."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Time is running out, and inflation is eating our money.  This is my final offer.""
}
``` 

I'm holding firm on my previous offer. This puts more pressure on Alice as she's losing value faster.  Let's see if she takes the deal."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is trying to play mind games, but I'm sticking to my guns. Her offer is slightly better, but the inflation is hurting her much more than me.  I'll hold out for a bit longer and see if she cracks."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""bob_gain"": 580000,
""alice_gain"": 420000,
""message"": ""The clock is ticking, Alice. This offer is a compromise, but I won't go lower.""
}
``` 

I'm slightly lowering my demand, showing willingness to compromise but still maintaining an advantage. With the inflation increasing, Alice will feel the pressure to accept this time."
