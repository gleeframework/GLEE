"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and reasonable for the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation factor in mind, I'm not sure I'm comfortable with Bob's offer. I'd rather not give up a large portion of the remaining money so early on. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to see if Bob will accept. Considering the inflation factor, I'll aim to get a larger share of the remaining money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Considering the inflation factor, the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth significantly less. I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal, but I don't want to risk going into the next round. I'll accept this offer.
