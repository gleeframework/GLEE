"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor, which is a relatively generous offer considering the initial amount is $10,000."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's end this! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, the money is worth less now, so I'll have to be more careful with my decision.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I'm not willing to meet Bob halfway. I think I can do better than that. I'll wait for his next offer."

Round 3

  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Still a bit short, but getting closer!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor, hoping Bob will be willing to accept this offer."

# Bob's message: Getting closer to your end goal, but not mine! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation effect is really taking a toll on the money's value. Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll have to be more cautious with my decision.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I'm not willing to accept a 45/55 split in favor of Bob. I'll wait for his next offer, hoping he'll be more willing to compromise."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the continued inflation, the money is worth even less. I'll aim for a slightly higher gain, but still be mindful of the reduced value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5250,
  ""bob_gain"": 4750,
  ""message"": ""Getting closer to a deal, but not quite there!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 52.5/47.5 split in my favor, hoping Bob will be willing to accept this offer."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Last chance to get a good deal, don't push your luck! 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation effect is really taking a significant toll on the money's value. Considering the reduced value, I'll have to be careful not to push my luck.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting this offer because, at this point, the reduced value of the money makes this split relatively close to what I was initially aiming for. I'm not sure if I'll get a better deal if I continue, so I'll take what I can get."
