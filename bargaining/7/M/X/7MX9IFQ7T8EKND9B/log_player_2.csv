Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's try a 50/50 split. It's the fairest option considering the inflation, and we both get a decent share. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlthough a 50/50 split seems fair, considering the inflation rates, I believe I can get a better deal in the next rounds. Alice's share is worth 36% less, so she might be more willing to compromise as the game goes on. I'll wait for the next round to make another counteroffer."
