"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent share and can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the inflation we both have to deal with. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I'd rather get a bigger share to compensate for the loss in value. I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob suggested a 60/40 split in the previous round, I'll counter with a 70/30 split, giving me a slightly larger share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""You wanted a 60/40 split, but I think I deserve more given the inflation""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's compromise. I'll take a bit less than my previous offer, but I need to account for the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation taking a bigger hit on Bob's share, I'll consider this offer. The 55/45 split is closer to my original proposal, and I think it's a reasonable compromise.
