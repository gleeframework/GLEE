"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the $100 in a 3:1 ratio. I keep 75$, while you receive 25$. This ensures a fair distribution considering the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  While the value of the money decreases for me, I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to ensure we both get a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{
