I propose to take 990,000 dollars and give Bob 10,000 dollars. This is a pretty generous offer for the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 950000, ""bob_gain"": 50000}
```

I'm going to try a slightly more even split this time, offering Bob 50,000 dollars while keeping 950,000 for myself.  I think this is still fair, given the inflation and the fact that Bob rejected my previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer more, it's getting risky to keep rejecting offers.  The value of the money is decreasing quickly and if we go a few more rounds, I might be left with nothing.  Accepting this offer will at least secure me some money."
