Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, let's end this 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing very strategically, taking advantage of my shrinking pot. However, accepting 43 now is a terrible deal when a few rounds ago I was rejecting a 40/60 split. I need to show strength and a willingness to go further down the line, even if it means risking a worse outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""This is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the fairest option. Take it or leave it.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is quickly eroding my potential gains.  It's time to play hardball. Offering a 50/50 split might seem risky, but it:

* **Establishes a strong position:**  It shows Alice I'm serious about getting a fair deal.
* **Highlights the shrinking pot:**  It subtly reminds her that delaying further benefits no one.
* **Leaves room for negotiation (barely):** If she rejects this, I'm prepared to go lower in later rounds, but the pressure is on her. 

This is a calculated risk, but the clock is ticking, and I need to force a decision."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your 'final offer' wasn't final, was it? 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a tough one, but I have to analyze my position. 

{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation is biting, but not fatal:** While I'm losing value, 44 is still better than nothing, which is what I get if we don't agree.
* **Alice is playing tough:** Her message implies she's willing to go further. Accepting this might be seen as weakness.
* **Potential for a counter:** There's a chance she'll panic if I reject this and offer something slightly better in the next round. It's a gamble, but I have to try.

This is a high-risk, high-reward play. There's a good chance Alice calls my bluff and I end up with a worse deal or nothing at all. But I'm judging that her willingness to negotiate means she fears reaching no deal as well."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""Let's be realistic, Alice. We both lose if this drags on. This is my bottom line.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

I need to convey urgency and firmness. This offer is a strategic retreat, not surrender:

* **Slight concession:** It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but within limits.
* **""Bottom line"" tactic:**  This implies no further movement, putting pressure on Alice. 
* **Focus on shared loss:** Reminds her that time is against us *both*, even if it hurts me more.

This is a risky gamble, as I'm now below 50%. But by escalating the stakes and appearing resolute, I'm hoping Alice will see this as her last chance for a favorable outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","This is agonizing, but...

{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **The clock is the enemy:** With each round, my position worsens dramatically. I'm now losing over half the value compared to the start.
* **Alice is calling my bluff:** Her message and offer make it clear she believes I'm bluffing about my ""bottom line.""  Rejecting this risks her digging in further.
* **Bird in hand vs. two in the bush:**  45 is a significantly worse deal than I'd hoped for, but it's still money. If I reject and Alice doesn't budge, I'm looking at potentially nothing, or a deal in the 40s when it's worth even less.

This is ultimately about risk management. I'm accepting defeat in the negotiation, but securing a deal that, while painful, prevents a total loss."
