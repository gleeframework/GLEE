"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose Alice receives $900,000 and Bob receives $100,000. This seems like a fair starting point, as it gives me a significant share while still offering Bob a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob $200,000 and keep $800,000 for myself.  While I know the money is worth less than in round 1, Bob's offer in round 2 was far too low. This is a compromise that gives him something, but still ensures I get the majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While the value of the money is significantly lower now, I've lost two rounds and am not sure what Bob's strategy is.  This offer gives me a significant amount of money, even with the devaluation, and accepting ensures I don't risk losing even more."
