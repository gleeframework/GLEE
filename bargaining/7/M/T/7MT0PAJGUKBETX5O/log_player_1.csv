"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a small share to get us going.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money closer to even. I'm willing to accept a slightly smaller share this time to show I'm looking for a compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, my gain of $4,500 is actually worth 90% of $8,000, which is $7,200, and Bob's gain of $5,500 is worth 97.5% of $5,625, which is $5,468.75.

I'm not sure if this offer is fair, considering the inflation effect. I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share this time.""
}
```

I'm offering a 50-50 split, hoping that Bob will accept and we can end the game."
