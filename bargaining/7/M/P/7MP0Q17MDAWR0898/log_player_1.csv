"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 20% of the money""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20 dollars, which is a relatively small portion, hoping that he'll accept and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 51/49 split is more fair, given the potential for inflation in future rounds. Let's see what you think. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the money is worth 5% less, so my gain of 49 dollars is actually worth 94.05 dollars in the first round's value.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with a 51/49 split, especially since I don't know how the inflation affects Bob's perception of the money. I'd like to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect, my gain of 49 dollars is worth 94.05 dollars in the first round's value, but since the money is worth 5% less in each subsequent round, I'll aim for a higher share to compensate for the decreasing value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you 40% now, but I think I deserve a bit more to account for the decreasing value of the money""
}
```"
