"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the high road, but I'll give you a slightly better deal this time 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more careful with the inflation in mind. With a 5% decrease, the actual value of my gain in this round would be 95% of $400,000, which is $380,000.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer because I think I can do better. I'll wait for Bob's next proposal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and the previous offers, I'll make a new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slight edge, but I'm not going to give away too much!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a decent offer and keeping a good share for myself. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
