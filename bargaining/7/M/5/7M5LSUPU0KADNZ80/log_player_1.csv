"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

This offer gives me the majority of the money (9000$) and leaves Bob with a smaller share (1000$). I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm prepared for a few rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

This is a fair offer. While I could try to push for more, there's a risk Bob will reject and we'll end up with nothing. Accepting a 50/50 split is the most sensible option."
