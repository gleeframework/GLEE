"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's split the money evenly. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nSince the offer is to split the money evenly, which is the most fair and optimal outcome for both parties in this scenario, there's no incentive to reject and proceed further. Accepting ensures both get an equal share without risking a less favorable outcome in subsequent rounds."
