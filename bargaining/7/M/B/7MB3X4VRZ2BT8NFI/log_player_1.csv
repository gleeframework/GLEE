"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20, seems fair to me""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 90-10 split is more fair, considering you're getting a free ride on inflation. 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, my $1,000 gain is actually worth $800 in real terms. Bob's $9,000 gain is still worth $9,000.

I'm not thrilled about the 90-10 split, but I think I can live with it. I'll accept the offer.
