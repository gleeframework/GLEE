"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 50/50 to start, it's a fair and simple proposal. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
 
It's a good starting point, but I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I think it's more fair to split the money 60/40 in my favor, as I'm taking the risk of rejection in this round.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not willing to give up too much. I think this split is a fair compromise. 
# Bob gain: 580000 
# Alice gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, the risk of getting nothing in the next round outweighs the potential gain. This is a reasonable compromise."
