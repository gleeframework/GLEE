Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I deserve a bit more, how about $50 for me and $50 for you? 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, Alice, but I think we can do better. How about $51 for me and $49 for you? I'm not giving up yet! 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is being incredibly stubborn and greedy.  He's losing value with each round, yet he's still aiming for more than half the pot. I need to show him I'm serious about getting a fair deal."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 53,
""bob_gain"": 47,
""message"": ""Bob, this is getting ridiculous. You're losing money with every round! Let's be reasonable - $53 for me, $47 for you. Take it or leave it!""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You think you're being reasonable, but I think we can still find a better split. How about $52 for me and $48 for you? I'm not backing down! 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While this is not ideal, it's the best offer I'm likely to get from Bob. He's dug in and doesn't seem to understand the impact of inflation on his share. Accepting now guarantees I get something, whereas continuing to push for a ""fair"" split might end up with both of us getting nothing."
