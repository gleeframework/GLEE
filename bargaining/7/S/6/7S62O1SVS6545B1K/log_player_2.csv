"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly.  Fair is fair! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nSince I'm Bob, I'll reject this offer because I think I can get a better deal in the next round. Plus, the 5% inflation rate for me means that the money is worth less with each passing round, so I want to try to get as much as I can as soon as possible.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I'll take a bit more, considering the inflation!""}\n\n###\n\nI'm making this offer because I want to take into account the 5% inflation rate that affects me. I'm hoping Alice will accept this offer, but if not, I'm willing to negotiate further.\n\n###\n\nLet me know what Alice decides!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think we should still be close to an even split. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm rejecting this offer because, considering the inflation, 45 is actually worth even less to me now (due to the 9.75% decrease in value). I think I can still try to get a better deal, despite the decreasing value of the money for me.\n\n###\n\nLet's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a fair split now.""}\n\n###\n\nI'm making this offer because, taking into account the 9.75% decrease in value for me, I'm hoping Alice will accept this as a compromise. I've lowered my previous offer slightly to try to meet her halfway, while still considering the impact of inflation on my gain.\n\n###\n\nLet me know what Alice decides!"
