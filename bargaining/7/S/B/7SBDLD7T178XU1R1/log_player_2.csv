"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer leaves us both with a decent amount. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While it's tempting to accept something, it's risky to accept a proposal where Alice gets significantly more than me. The game is only just starting, and I have time to negotiate a better deal.  I'll see if I can get a better split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better with a more balanced split. This offer gives us both a fair share.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out. This is a good deal for you considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is still significantly skewed in her favor. While the threat of inflation is real, I'm not ready to give in yet. I have more rounds to negotiate and can still improve my position."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 40, ""alice_gain"": 60, ""message"": ""Alice, we're both losing money with each round. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us. This offer is a step closer to a fair split.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a fair compromise.  Let's settle this before the inflation eats away at your share even more. 
# Bob gain: 38 
# Alice gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

The inflation is getting to be a real problem, but I still believe I can get a better deal.  Alice is continuing to offer a split heavily in her favor, and I'm not willing to give up on a fairer outcome just yet.  Let's keep negotiating."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 42, ""alice_gain"": 58, ""message"": ""Alice, we're both losing out on money with each round. Let's find a compromise that's more balanced. This offer is closer to a fair split, and we can avoid losing even more.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Take this offer before the inflation makes it completely worthless for you! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

The inflation is seriously biting into my share, and the offers are getting closer to my initial goal. While I'd prefer a more even split, I don't want to risk getting nothing at all. This offer is a reasonable compromise considering the circumstances."
