Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your need for more, Alice, but I think we should start closer to 50/50. This offer is still slightly in your favor, but also considers my declining value. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
