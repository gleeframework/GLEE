"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my initial offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```
I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me a larger share of the initial $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me and 20% less for Bob, this offer is actually a 50-40 split in Bob's favor, not 50-50.

I'll reject this offer:
```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the previous offers and rejections, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer. Here's my proposal for Round 3:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```
I'm proposing a 80-20 split, giving me a larger share of the remaining $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 36 
# Bob gain: 64 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values:

My gain is worth the same as in the first round, which is $60.
Bob's gain is worth 100 - 64 = 36% of the original amount, which is 36% of $100 = $36.

So, this offer is actually a 60-36 split, which is in my favor.

I'll accept this offer:
```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```"
