900000.0,100000.0,I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. I believe this is a fair offer given the potential for inflation in later rounds.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
450000.0,550000.0,I believe a 55/45 split is more equitable. It accounts for inflation and offers us both a substantial share.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
600000.0,400000.0,"Let's compromise. I'm willing to take a smaller share, but I think a 60/40 split is fair considering the inflation and the potential for even more losses in the future.",Alice,3,
