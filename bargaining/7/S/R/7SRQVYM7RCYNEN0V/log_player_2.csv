I'm going to reject this offer. Alice is getting a much better deal, and I'm willing to see if I can negotiate a fairer split."

# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice's offer still heavily favors her, and while I understand the time pressure, I'm not going to give in to an unfair deal. I'll try to negotiate again in the next round."

# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While I acknowledge the pressure from inflation, I'm still not willing to accept such a lopsided deal. I'm going to keep trying to reach a more equitable split in the next round."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 475000, ""alice_gain"": 525000, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time.  I'm willing to compromise and move closer to your last offer.  Let's split it this way, and we can both walk away with something decent.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer.  We're both losing money with every passing round. Let's be sensible and end this now. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the offer still favors Alice, the inflation is cutting into our potential gains significantly. It's better to accept this deal than risk getting nothing at all."
