"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair. I'll take most of the money, but you still get a decent share. Accept this and we'll both be happy. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
 
I reject this offer. While it's tempting to get something right away, the inflation rate significantly favors me if we keep negotiating.  I want to see what Alice is willing to offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is fair considering the inflation rates.  Let's work together to get something for both of us.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I'm willing to meet you halfway. This is the best I can do given the inflation. Let's end this and get something for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation is impacting Alice's offer more significantly than mine. Accepting this offer guarantees me a decent amount of money, and it's better than risking losing everything with more rounds."
