"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to be more generous in the second round!

I'll think about it for a moment... Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's offer is now 50/50, I'll decide to...
