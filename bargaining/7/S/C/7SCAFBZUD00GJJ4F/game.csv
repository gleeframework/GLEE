60.0,40.0,Let's make a deal. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. It's a good offer for you considering the time pressure and inflation.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
55.0,45.0,Your offer was a bit too skewed in your favor. Let's find a compromise. How about a 55/45 split?,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
60.0,40.0,"I understand your desire for a compromise, but I need a larger share to account for the inflation affecting my gains. I'm sticking with my previous offer of 60/40. Time is running out, and this is a fair deal.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
52.0,48.0,"Alice, I'm trying to be fair, but your offer doesn't account for the time pressure on both of us.  52/48 is my final offer.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
58.0,42.0,"Bob, I acknowledge your attempt at fairness, but the declining value of the money significantly impacts me.  I'm willing to compromise slightly â€“ 58/42. Let's close this deal and avoid losing more.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
50.0,50.0,"Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  The deal has to benefit both of us.  50/50 is the only fair split.",Bob,6,
