"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can negotiate further if needed""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $600,000 and Bob gets $400,000. The message is a friendly opening offer, suggesting we can discuss and adjust the split if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering I'm the one making the proposal this round. We can always adjust further if you want to keep playing. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the 10% inflation, my gain would be 540,000 (600,000 * 0.9), and Bob's gain would be 720,000 (600,000 * 1.2).

I'd like to reject this offer and continue playing. I think I can do better than a 40% share. 

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more given the risks and efforts involved""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $550,000 and Bob gets $450,000. The message is a message to Bob, suggesting that I'm open to negotiation, but I'm not willing to give up too much."
