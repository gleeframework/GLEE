"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You should have taken the first offer! 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""I'm cutting my losses. Take it or leave it.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You should have taken one of my previous offers. Now it's too late. 
# Bob gain: 20 
# Alice gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, taking the deal is the only way to guarantee Bob gets anything. 

**Here's why:**

* **Inflation:** The value of Bob's potential gain diminishes significantly with each round. 
* **Alice's Strategy:**  Alice is clearly employing a strategy of waiting out Bob, knowing the inflation works in her favor.

**If Bob rejects:**

* In Round 6, even if Bob manages to secure the entire $100, its value will have depreciated to the point where it's worth less than the $20 offered in Round 5. 

This situation highlights the power of time and discounting in negotiations."
