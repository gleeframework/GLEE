"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $4000 and keep $6000 for myself. My reasoning is that I want to start with a somewhat even split, but also give myself a slight advantage since the money is worth less to me with each passing round. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game quickly.\n\nYour turn! Please respond with Bob's decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your turn! I'm feeling generous, but let's wrap this up quickly. Time is money. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not happy with this offer, as I would be getting significantly less than Bob, and the money is worth even less to me now due to inflation. I'll reject this offer and try to make a better proposal in the next round. Let's see if I can turn the tables!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### Step 1: Calculate the adjusted value of the money for both players after two rounds of inflation.
For Alice, the money is worth 20% less with each passing round. So, after two rounds, the value is 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64 of the original.
For Bob, the money is worth 5% less with each passing round. So, after two rounds, the value is 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.9025 of the original.

### Step 2: Determine a new offer that takes into account the adjusted values and the goal of reaching an agreement.
Given the decreasing value of the money, especially for Alice, it's crucial to try and reach an agreement sooner rather than later. However, the offer should still be attractive enough for Bob to accept, considering his loss is less significant.

### Step 3: Formulate an offer that slightly adjusts the previous proposal to make it more appealing to Bob while considering the urgency for Alice.
Given Bob's previous offer and the need to find a middle ground, Alice could propose a division that slightly increases Bob's share compared to her initial offer but doesn't go as low as Bob's offer in round 2.

### Step 4: Attach a message that emphasizes the mutual benefit of accepting the offer now rather than continuing.
The message should convey the importance of reaching an agreement quickly, highlighting how further rounds will only decrease the value of the money for both, but especially for Alice.

The final answer is: {""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle before it's too late""}"
