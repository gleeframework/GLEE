"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the money in a 3:1 ratio, with you receiving $2500. I believe this is fair considering the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds. 
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While the offer is tempting, it's in my best interest to reject and see if Alice will offer me a better deal in the next round, considering the money will be worth less for her."
