"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I'll take the lion's share this time, but you'll get a chance to even the score later on. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
 
While Alice's proposal is generous in the first round, it sets a dangerous precedent for future rounds. Rejecting the offer allows me to control the next round's proposal and potentially negotiate a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's split the difference. I'll take a slightly larger share this time, but I'm willing to negotiate more evenly in future rounds.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a larger share to make up for the inflation affecting me more. Let's try to find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is still heavily skewed in her favor, and I believe I can negotiate a better deal.  While I'm losing value with each round, so is she, and at a higher rate.  I need to hold out for a more balanced proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's call it even this time. I'm not willing to go lower than 500,000, and I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to move forward. We can discuss adjustments in future rounds.""}
