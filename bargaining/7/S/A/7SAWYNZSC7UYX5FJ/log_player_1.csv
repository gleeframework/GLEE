"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

This is a fair initial offer, as it splits the money evenly. Since the money is worth less to Alice with each round, she would be wise to try and get a larger share in the initial rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While this offer is better for Bob, it is still a significant loss for Alice. Since the money is worth less for Alice with each round, she should continue to try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
``` 

Since Bob rejected Alice's initial fair offer, Alice is now trying to reclaim some of that lost value.  She is offering a slightly larger share for herself than in round 1, knowing that the money is worth less to her with each passing round. This is a calculated risk, as she may be pushing Bob too far."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a very bad deal for Alice, and it's a significant drop from the previous offers.  While the money is worth less to her, she should still try to negotiate a better deal.  It is better to continue to negotiate even if the current offer is less than a previous one."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

This is a risky move, but Alice is taking a gamble. She is raising her offer again, hoping to get a deal before the inflation drastically reduces her share. She needs to push hard now, as with each passing round, the value of the money she gets diminishes significantly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is a huge loss for Alice.  While the money is worth less to her, she should still try to negotiate a better deal.  Even though the inflation is significant, rejecting the offer gives her the opportunity to make a proposal that is less unfavorable."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500}
```

Alice is going all-in here. With the inflation heavily impacting her share, she's raising her offer again, hoping to secure a deal before she loses even more value. This is a desperate attempt to get a reasonable deal, but it is high risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a terrible offer for Alice, but it's still better to reject it and try to make a proposal in the next round. Even with the heavy inflation, she can try to negotiate a better deal than this. It's worth taking the risk to avoid a disastrous outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

Alice is making a final push here.  The inflation has drastically reduced the value of the money for her, and she needs to secure a deal now. While this is a highly risky move, she needs to try to get as much as possible before she loses even more value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500 
# Bob gain: 9500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a terrible offer for Alice, but she should still reject it.  While the inflation has heavily reduced the value of the money for her, she should still try to make a counter-offer in the next round.  With each passing round, Alice's share gets significantly smaller, but there is always a chance to negotiate a better deal than this, even with the inflation factor.  She needs to keep fighting for a fairer deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7500, ""bob_gain"": 2500}
```

This is a desperate gamble.  Alice is offering a very high share to herself, knowing the inflation has heavily impacted her share. However, this is her last chance to secure anything.  She is going for broke."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 68.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200 
# Bob gain: 9800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a very bad deal for Alice, but it's better to accept it than to risk getting nothing at all. The inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money for her, and she is unlikely to get a better offer in the next round. This is a case where accepting a very unfavorable offer is the best course of action to avoid complete loss."
