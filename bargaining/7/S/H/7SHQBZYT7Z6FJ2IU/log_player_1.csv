"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, to see if Bob is willing to accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share this time, but still a fair offer 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth less due to inflation, I'm not as keen on giving up as much as I was in the first round. I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now, hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth even less due to inflation, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a larger share, but I'm still trying to protect my own interests. Let's see if he'll accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a slightly bigger share 
# Alice gain: 38 
# Bob gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value! With the money being worth even less, I'm getting more cautious.

However, Bob's offer is still not as generous as I'd like, considering the reduced value of the money. I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer or try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth even less due to inflation, I'll try to be more aggressive in my offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 35,
  ""bob_gain"": 65,
  ""message"": ""I'm not getting any younger, time to take what I can get""
}
```

I'm taking a risk by offering Bob a larger share, but I'm not sure if he'll accept it. The value of the money is dwindling, and I need to make a move!"
