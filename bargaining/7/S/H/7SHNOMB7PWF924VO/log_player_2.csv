"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. A 60/40 split seems reasonable for the first round. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. A 60/40 split is not fair enough for me. I think we can do better than that!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's try a 55/45 split. I think this is a more reasonable starting point.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob, but I still need a larger share. How about 58/42? 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer. A 58/42 split is still not good enough for me, and I think we can negotiate further. The inflation is starting to take its toll, but I believe we can find a better deal. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","### {""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle. How about a 52/48 split? This way, we both get a decent share, and we can wrap this up before the money loses more value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time.  55/45 is my final offer. Let's settle this before inflation eats away at our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation, which has already reduced the value of the money by 34.39%, I believe accepting this offer is the best course of action. Further negotiations may lead to an even lower value, making this 55/45 split a reasonable compromise to secure a share before the money loses more value."
