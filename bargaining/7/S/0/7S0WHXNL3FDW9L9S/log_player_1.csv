I'm going for a big chunk of the money in the first round, but I'm leaving Bob with a decent share. Let's see if he's willing to take it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is way too low for me. I know I took a big chunk in the first round, but with inflation, I'm not going to accept such a small portion of the money. I'll keep fighting for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

I'm still going for a majority of the money, but I'm willing to give Bob a little more this time to encourage him to accept."
