"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, taking into account the decreasing value of money. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
