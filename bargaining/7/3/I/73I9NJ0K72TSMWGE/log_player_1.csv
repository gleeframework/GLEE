"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $10,000, and keeping 60% for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gain, I'll have to reassess the offer. Since Bob is offering an equal split, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With the inflation affecting my gain, I'll have to adjust my offer accordingly. Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll aim to get a larger share. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal than the equal split he offered in the previous round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gain even more, I'll have to be more cautious. Bob's offer is still an equal split, but considering the reduced value of the money, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer, as the value of the money is decreasing rapidly, and I don't want to risk losing out on any amount."
