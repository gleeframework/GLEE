"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! I'm offering you $100,000. Accept and we can wrap up the game.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 300k, you can have the rest. It's a fair start 
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, so I'll be left with 720,000.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
