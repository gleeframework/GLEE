"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:
```
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```
I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it... I'm not thrilled about giving up 5 more dollars, but I don't want to risk going to the next round and losing even more value due to inflation. I'll accept this offer.
