"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
This is a good starting point. While Alice's proposal is ""fair"" on the surface, it favors her significantly. Since we have 12 rounds, there's room to negotiate and potentially get a better deal for Bob. Let's see if we can get a more even split!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split this down the middle. It's fair and we both get a good amount.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a bit less, but still a good deal 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice is still offering a deal that heavily favors her.  While I'm not in a rush to accept anything, let's see if we can get a bit closer to a 50/50 split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly bigger share this time, but I'm hoping we can reach a more even split soon. Let's work together to find a solution that's fair to both of us.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, meet me in the middle of our last offers 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is still heavily slanted in her favor. It's getting a bit late in the game, but we're still not in a rush to accept anything that doesn't feel closer to fair. Let's keep trying for a more even split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4900, ""alice_gain"": 5100, ""message"": ""This is my final offer before we both get nothing. I'm willing to give you a slight advantage, but it's the closest I'm willing to go to your previous offers.  Think about it carefully.""}
