Let's see if Bob likes my generous offer! ðŸ˜Š"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not happy with this offer! Bob is getting way too much, and even though I'm not losing any money due to inflation, I'm going to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

This is a more balanced offer, considering Bob's money is worth less now due to inflation. Let's see if he'll accept this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though Bob is still getting a better deal than I'd like, his money is now worth significantly less due to inflation.  It's getting late in the game, and I don't want to risk getting a worse offer in the next round. I'll take this offer."
