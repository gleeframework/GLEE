"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose to keep 6000$ and give Bob 4000$. This seems like a fair starting point, given the potential for inflation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred to keep more, the inflation will eat away at my potential earnings if I reject this offer.  Accepting ensures I get a decent amount, and I'm not confident I can do better in the future rounds."
