"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for a better offer. It's just the first round, and I'm not in a hurry to settle for half. Bring on the next proposal!"

Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's compromise. I'm willing to give you a bit more, but we need to find a solution before the inflation eats away at our gains. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nIt's still early in the game, and I'm not convinced that 55 is the best I can get. The inflation is a concern, but I'm willing to take the risk to potentially get a better offer. Let's see what the next round brings!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""I'll meet you halfway on your compromise, but I still think I deserve a bit more.""}"
