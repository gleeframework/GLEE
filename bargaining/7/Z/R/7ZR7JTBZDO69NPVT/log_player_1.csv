I propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor, knowing that there's a lot of rounds to go and the money will be worth less in the future. It's a big advantage for me in the beginning, but I want to leave room for negotiation in case I need to make concessions later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is a clear reversal of my initial proposal. While the inflation impacts our gains differently, I still believe I can get a better deal than a 1000/9000 split. I will counter with a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm willing to lower my initial demand, but I'm still aiming for a larger share. I'm taking into account the inflation and the fact that Bob seems to be aiming for a more even split. This offer should hopefully be more appealing than Bob's last proposal."
