"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to negotiate if you want more.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 90% of the money and Bob gets 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's a fair start, and we can both benefit from the deal sooner rather than later. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","My gain of 500,000 is worth 90% of 500,000, which is 450,000, due to the 10% inflation.

I accept Bob's offer.
