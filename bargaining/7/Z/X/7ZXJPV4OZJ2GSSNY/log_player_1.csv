"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's divide it fairly""}\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split, with me getting $6000 and Bob getting $4000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's only fair that we split the money evenly 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, considering the inflation, I would be getting less than half of the original amount, while Bob would be getting more than half. I think I can get a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll offer a 55-45 split, considering the inflation that has already occurred. I'll get $5500, and Bob will get $4500. My message to Bob is that we should compromise to avoid further loss due to inflation.\n{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's compromise to avoid further loss""}\n\nYour turn, Bob!"
