Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","In this round, I'll try to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth even less to Alice, while its value remains the same for me. I'll propose a division that benefits me more, but still leaves Alice with a considerable amount, taking into account the significant decrease in value she's experiencing due to inflation.
