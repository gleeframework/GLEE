"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to give you a larger share than last round, but I need to get a good deal too.  What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, I think we can still get a better deal.  The inflation rate is making each round more costly."
