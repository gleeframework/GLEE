"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}

I propose to take almost all the money, leaving Bob with just $1.  I figure that's better than nothing, and he might be desperate enough to take it.  Plus, with the inflation in effect, I'll be getting much more in the next round if he rejects my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, it's better to take a 50/50 split now than risk getting nothing in the next round with inflation."
