"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. The message is a friendly opening offer, suggesting we start with a fair split and see if we can improve from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started with a fair split, but I'm looking for a bit more. Let's see if we can do better. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less in Round 2, my proposed gain of $600,000 is now worth $570,000.

I'm not pleased with Bob's counteroffer, as it's a significant shift in the ratio. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a pretty big swing in your favor. I'm not comfortable with a 7:3 split.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 5% less in Round 3, my proposed gain of $570,000 is now worth $541,500.

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'd like to see a bit more compromise from you.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think I can do better than that. Your last offer was close, but I'll give you a bit more to sweeten the deal. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 14.26% less in Round 4, my proposed gain of $541,500 is now worth $465,111.

I'm not thrilled with the fact that Bob's offer is almost identical to his previous one, and it seems like he's trying to get me to accept a 55:45 split. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I don't see much movement from your previous offer. I'd like to see some more concessions from you.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not going to give up too much. Let's find a balance.""
}
