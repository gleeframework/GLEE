"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This is a fairly generous offer, considering that the money is worth 20% less for me each round, and I want to make a good impression to start the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll have to be more cautious with my decisions.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now. I think I can do better than a 50/50 split, considering the inflation rate.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With the money being worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money.

Here's my offer for round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

This offer gives me a slightly larger share, but still leaves Bob with a substantial amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth significantly less for me, I need to be more aggressive in my decision-making.

I'll accept Bob's offer for round 4. The difference in value between the two options is not significant enough to warrant rejecting the offer, and I'd rather take the 5200 than risk going to the next round with even lower-value money.
