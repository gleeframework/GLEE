Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value fast, I'll give you a little more than last time, but not much 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for Bob.  While Alice's offer isn't great, waiting any longer will likely result in an even worse deal for Bob. Accepting now cuts his losses."
