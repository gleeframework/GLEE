Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm offering a larger share, but it's a deal that benefits us both before inflation eats away at the value. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
