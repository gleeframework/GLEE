"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
This is a very lopsided offer.  While it's better than nothing, Bob should definitely reject and see what Alice offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000}
``` 
 
This is a very generous offer from Bob in the first round.  There's a good chance Alice will accept it, but if she doesn't, Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate fairly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While it's not a great deal, it's better than getting nothing in the 12th round. This offer is a significant improvement over the first offer, and Bob is losing value on his earnings with each round.  It's time to cut losses and accept."
