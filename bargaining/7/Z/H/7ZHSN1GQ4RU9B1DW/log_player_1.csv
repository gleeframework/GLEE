Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer was heavily skewed in your favor. Let's be more realistic. This offer still gives you a significant portion considering the inflation you face. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000
