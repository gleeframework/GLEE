Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, my gain of 45 is worth 36% of the original value, which is 45 / 0.64 = 70.31 in the first round's value. That's a good deal, but I'll try to do better.
