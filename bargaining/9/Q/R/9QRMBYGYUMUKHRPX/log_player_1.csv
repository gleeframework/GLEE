Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose to take 99 dollars and leave 1 dollar for Bob. This is a fair offer considering the potential of inflation in the later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
