Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to find a middle ground. 42/58 is a fairer split, considering the decreasing value for me. 
# Alice gain: 58 
# Bob gain: 42 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 65,
""bob_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""I understand the inflation is impacting you, but my offer is still on the table. 65/35 is a fair deal, especially considering time is running out.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the impact of inflation, I think 45/55 is a reasonable split. Let's find a mutually beneficial agreement before time runs out. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
``` 

Bob's offer is getting closer to a more even split, and the inflation is starting to significantly impact him. Accepting now guarantees a reasonable share, whereas continued rejection risks getting nothing if we don't reach an agreement in time."
