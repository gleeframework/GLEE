"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a relatively even split considering we're just starting the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, the numbers are:

* My gain: 450000 * 0.95 = 427500
* Bob's gain: 550000 * 0.9 = 495000

I think Bob's offer is still a bit too generous on his side. I'll try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I appreciate the compromise, Bob, but I think I can do better than that. I'll make a counteroffer in Round 3.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the next round of inflation, my gain is worth 5% less than in Round 2, and Bob's gain is worth 10% less than in Round 2.

The adjusted numbers are:

* My gain: 427500 * 0.95 = 405562.5
* Bob's gain: 495000 * 0.9 = 445500

I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, Bob, but I'm not going to give away too much. This is my best offer so far.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise further, but I'm not going to give away too much more. This is my best offer so far. 
# Alice gain: 380000 
# Bob gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the next round of inflation, the numbers are:

* My gain: 405562.5 * 0.855 = 346,819.38
* Bob's gain: 445,500 * 0.727 = 324,155

Considering the significant drop in value due to inflation, I'll have to be more cautious. However, Bob's offer is still a bit more generous than I'd like.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I appreciate the compromise, Bob, but I think I can do better than that. I'll make a counteroffer in Round 5.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the next round of inflation, my gain is worth 5% less than in Round 4, and Bob's gain is worth 10% less than in Round 4.

The adjusted numbers are:

* My gain: 346,819.38 * 0.95 = 329,377.97
* Bob's gain: 324,155 * 0.9 = 291,839.50

I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""bob_gain"": 600000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, Bob, but I'm not going to give away too much more. This is my final offer.""
}
```

Note that I'm trying to get closer to the initial 60-40 split, but I'm still being cautious given the inflation."
