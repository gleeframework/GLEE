Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a pretty aggressive offer. I'm hoping Bob will take it, but if not, I'll adjust my strategy for the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It's better to take a 50/50 split now than risk getting nothing later, especially considering the inflation."
