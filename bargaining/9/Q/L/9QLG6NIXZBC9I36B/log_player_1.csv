"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm offering a 90/10 split in my favor. This is a strong opening offer, but I'm willing to negotiate if Bob wants to continue."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I prefer a larger share,  accepting this offer is the best strategy.  The inflation means that my 90$ share is worth less now. Accepting Bob's offer ensures I still get a significant amount of the money, and there's no guarantee that I can get a better deal in the next round."
