Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your rate of loss is higher than mine. I'm willing to adjust slightly to 56/44, but I need you to meet me halfway. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is slightly adjusting her offer, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. Given the faster rate of inflation for me, waiting even a couple more rounds with no deal would be worse than accepting this offer. I need to push for a more significant change to make it worthwhile."
