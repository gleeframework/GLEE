"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose taking 90% of the money and leaving 10% for Bob. This is a fair starting offer, as it leaves a significant portion for Bob while securing the majority for myself.  It's important to note that the inflation rate will likely impact Bob's perspective on this offer more than mine, as he won't know the exact details."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the most logical choice. The inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money, and it is unlikely that I will get a better offer in the next round. Accepting this 50/50 split guarantees me a significant amount of money, which is better than risking getting nothing if we fail to reach an agreement within the 12 rounds."
