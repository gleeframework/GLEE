```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to get a good start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to begin with, hoping to set a fair tone for the rest of the game."

```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, hoping to get a better deal before the value of the money continues to decrease."

# Alice gain: 45

# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more, but I'll give you a decent share too. 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58
