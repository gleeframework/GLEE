"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $10,000, which is $8,000, and Bob gets 20%, which is $2,000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering we're both starting from scratch."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try 60-40, a more balanced split! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 20% decrease in value, but I'm willing to consider Bob's revised offer.

After some thought, I've decided to:

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I think 60-40 is a more balanced split, and I'm willing to compromise to get the game moving. I'll take $6,000 and Bob can have $4,000. Let's move on to the next round!"
