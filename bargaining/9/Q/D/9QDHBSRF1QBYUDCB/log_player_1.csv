"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the lion's share, but I'm willing to give you a small chunk. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round. I'd be getting $400,000 in today's money, which is a decent chunk.

However, I'm not thrilled about Bob taking the lion's share. I'd like to negotiate further to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less again, my gain is now worth 64% of what it was in the first round. I'd be getting $320,000 in today's money.

I'll try to negotiate a better deal by offering a slightly higher amount to Bob.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 300000,
  ""bob_gain"": 700000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bigger share, but I still want a decent amount for myself.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small token, but I'm not going to let you take too much. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 51.2% of what it was in the first round, which is $512,000 in today's money.

Bob's offer is quite low, and I'm not thrilled about it. However, I don't want to risk getting nothing, so I'll consider it.
