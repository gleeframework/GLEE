"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need for negotiations!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer. Consider it a compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 5% less, so I'll have to be more cautious.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure if Bob's offer is a genuine compromise or just a way to take advantage of the inflation. I'd like to propose my own offer to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much. Consider this a fair compromise.""
}
```

I'm increasing my gain slightly, but still trying to maintain a balance between getting a good deal and not giving away too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is catching up, and my gain is worth significantly less than in the first round. Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that Bob's offer is his ""final"" one, and I'd like to see if I can negotiate further to get a better deal. His gain is increasing, but I'm not sure if it's justified."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3800,
  ""bob_gain"": 6200,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more. This is my best offer so far.""
}
```

I'm increasing my gain slightly, trying to find a balance between getting a good deal and not giving away too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to get a bit desperate, but I still think I deserve a bigger share. This is my last offer before I walk away. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking its toll, and my gain is worth significantly less than in the first round. Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that Bob is genuinely desperate, and I'm starting to think he's just trying to get a better deal by playing on my time constraints. I'd like to see if I can make one final push to get a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""bob_gain"": 6000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not falling for your desperation tactic. This is my final offer, take it or leave it.""
}
```

I'm going back to a 50/50 split, but with a slightly higher value due to the lower inflation rate in this round. I'm trying to make it clear that I'm not willing to negotiate further."
