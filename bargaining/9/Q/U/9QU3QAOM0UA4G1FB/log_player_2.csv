"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take the lion's share this time, but let's see how you feel about it. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's meet somewhere in the middle.""}\n\nSince the money is worth 10% less in each round, I'd like to find a mutually beneficial agreement quickly. This offer gives me a bit more than half, but still leaves a substantial amount for Alice."
