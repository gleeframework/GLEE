Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Given the significant difference in inflation impact, this is the most reasonable offer 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a tough situation, and ideally, I would hold out for a better deal. However, the longer this goes on, the more value we both lose. At this point, accepting Alice's offer, even though it favors her, is better than continuing to lose value due to inflation."
