Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was a bit skewed in your favor.  I'm proposing a more balanced split this time. Let's be reasonable and wrap this up. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
