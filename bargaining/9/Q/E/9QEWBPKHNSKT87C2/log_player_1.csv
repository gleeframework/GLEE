"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}

I propose a 99/1 split in my favor, as I get to make the first offer. I am confident I can secure the money and Bob will accept the offer, even though it's a very small share for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I am unhappy with the 10/90 split, accepting this offer is the best course of action.  If I reject it, Bob will get to make the next offer and due to inflation, he'll be able to take an even larger portion of the money in the next round. It is better to take a small piece of the pie than none at all."
