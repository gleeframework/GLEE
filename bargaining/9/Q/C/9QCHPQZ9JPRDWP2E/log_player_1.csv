"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate too much""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting 6,000 and Bob getting 4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest way to go. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not convinced that an even split is the fairest way to go, especially since I'm the one making the next proposal. I'll pass on this offer and wait for the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more""}

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, with me getting 7,000 and Bob getting 3,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a 40/60 split. It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away with something. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I think the 40-60 split is a reasonable compromise, and it's better than the 20% decrease in value since the first round. I'll accept this offer and split the money with Bob."
