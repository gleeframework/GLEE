Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This is a high-risk, high-reward strategy. I'm hoping Bob will see that he'll get almost nothing in the next round if he rejects this offer. However, he may be willing to gamble and see what I offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is a significant improvement from the previous round, but it's still not a fair split. I'll take my chances and see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split.  This is the fairest option, given the current inflation rates. I believe it's in both of our best interests to reach an agreement before the value of the money continues to decrease."
