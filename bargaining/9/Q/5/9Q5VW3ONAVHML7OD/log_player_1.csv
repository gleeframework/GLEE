"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 7:3, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 70 dollars and leaving 30 dollars for Bob. I'm framing it as a fair split, but of course, I'm trying to get the better deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try again, a bit more balanced this time! 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my 60 dollars is actually worth less than my initial 70 dollars.

I'll think about it... With this offer, I'd be taking 60 dollars, which is worth less than my initial 70 dollars. But Bob is offering a more balanced split this time, and I don't want to risk getting a worse deal if I reject.

I'll accept this offer.
