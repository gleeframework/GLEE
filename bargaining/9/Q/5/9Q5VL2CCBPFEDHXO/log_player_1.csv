"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start, hoping to set a good tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer. With the money worth 5% less, $3000 is now equivalent to $2850 in the previous round's value.

I'm not sure if I want to accept a smaller share, but I also don't want to risk going to the next round and potentially getting an even worse deal.

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, but I also don't want to risk going to the next round and potentially getting an even worse deal.
