"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, Bob. You'll get a better deal if we split now due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Alice's offer. While it's tempting to go for a quick deal, the inflation rate will hurt me more than Alice. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Let's switch it up, Alice. I'm willing to give you 40, but I need 60 to make it worth my while. Inflation is going to hit us both hard, so let's make a deal before it's too late.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a better deal for you than last round considering the inflation.  Let's be reasonable and close this deal now. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm still going to reject this offer. While it's slightly better than her last offer, it's still not as good as I can potentially get. Inflation is hurting me more than Alice, so I need to wait for a deal that favors me more."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 65,
""alice_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm still feeling the impact of inflation. I need to get a better deal than the last couple of rounds. If you're willing to take 35, I'll give you 65. This is a better deal for you than the last offer, and it avoids further inflation hitting both of us.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. Inflation is eating away at our potential gains. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both leave with something substantial. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd love to get a better deal, inflation is getting out of control.  A 50/50 split is the fairest option now, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all."
