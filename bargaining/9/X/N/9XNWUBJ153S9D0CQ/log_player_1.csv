Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer Alice, but I think this split is more reflective of the decreasing value of the money as the rounds progress. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a tough one! Bob's offer is tempting, especially since the value of my share will keep decreasing. However, getting less than half feels unfair. 

Let's try to negotiate a bit more.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, time is running out.  This offer ensures we both walk away with something substantial before inflation eats away at the value. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is driving a hard bargain and knows time is on his side!  I need to decide if I'm willing to take a less favorable deal to ensure I get something. 

```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
Even though it's less than I wanted, accepting guarantees a decent amount rather than risking getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
