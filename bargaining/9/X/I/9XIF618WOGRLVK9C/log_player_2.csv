Alice's offer:

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a good amount, but since the money loses value over time, I think I should get a bit more.""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable. We're losing money with every round. I propose a 50/50 split to end this fairly before inflation eats away at our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000
