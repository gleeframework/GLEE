"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the money, which is a relatively small amount, to see if he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to start. Let's see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","A 50/50 split is a fair offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best option for me. Considering the inflation, I'd rather try to get a bit more. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less now, I'll aim to get a bit more. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slight edge, but I need to get a bit more for myself.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 45% of the money, which is a bit less than the 50% he offered in the previous round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to get a bit more for myself as well. Let's try to reach a compromise. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation taking a bigger toll, I need to be more cautious. Bob's offer is still a bit too generous for me, considering the reduced value of the money. I'd rather try to get a bit more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5

  ""bob_gain"": 58,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get a bit more to make it worth my while.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 58% of the money, which is a bit less than his previous offer, but I'm trying to get a bit more for myself."
