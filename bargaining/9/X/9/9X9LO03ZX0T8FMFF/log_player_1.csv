"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a decent share""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70:30 split in my favor, which is a relatively generous offer considering the game just started. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet you in the middle, no need to be greedy 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my potential gain is now worth 5% less, so the offer from Bob is actually more attractive than it initially seems.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
