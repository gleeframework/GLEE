# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, but this split is more in line with the decreasing value of the money.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, I'll offer a bit more 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is slightly better, it's not enough to offset the significant inflation hitting my potential earnings.  I need to push for a more substantial gain in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time and the money is losing value fast. This offer gives us both a decent share considering the circumstances.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's find a middle ground considering the inflation 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**  The inflation is really starting to bite into my potential gains. While Alice's offer acknowledges the shrinking pot, it's still skewed in her favor. I need to hold out for a more equitable split, even if it means risking a worse outcome in later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  The money is losing value with every passing round. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical solution at this point.""}"
