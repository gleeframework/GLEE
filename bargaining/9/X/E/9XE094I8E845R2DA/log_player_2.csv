"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split the money evenly. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nSince the offer is to split the money evenly, which is the most fair and reasonable proposal, there's no incentive to reject and proceed further, hoping to get a better deal. Accepting ensures a guaranteed half of the total amount."
