**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The value of the money is decreasing significantly with each round. Waiting any longer means a worse deal for both of us.
* **Bob's Stance:** His message implies this is his last offer. Rejecting it means risking an even lower offer in the next round, with a significantly reduced overall value due to inflation. 
* **Current Offer vs. Future Uncertainty:**  Accepting guarantees me 450,000 (significantly less than my initial offers but impacted by inflation). Rejecting and hoping for a better offer in the next round is too risky, given the rapidly decreasing value and Bob's seemingly firm stance."
