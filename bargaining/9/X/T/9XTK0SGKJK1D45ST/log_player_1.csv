"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose to take 990,000 dollars and leave 10,000 dollars for Bob. This seems like a fair offer considering the potential of inflation in the future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
