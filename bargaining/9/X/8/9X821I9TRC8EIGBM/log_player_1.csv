"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $4000 and keeping $6000 for myself. Since the money loses value over rounds, especially more significantly for Bob, I'm hoping this initial offer will be seen as fair and Bob will accept it to avoid further devaluation in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, despite the inflation, I believe I can get a better deal in subsequent rounds. With the money losing more value for Bob than for me, I'm hoping he'll be more inclined to settle for a less favorable split as the rounds progress. Additionally, accepting a 60/40 split in Bob's favor after I initially proposed a split in my favor seems like a significant concession. I'll take the risk of further inflation to potentially secure a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet halfway from my initial offer""}\n\nGiven the increasing devaluation of money for both of us, but more so for Bob, I'm adjusting my initial offer slightly in his favor but still keeping the larger share. The message aims to appeal to Bob's understanding of the inflationary pressure and the fact that subsequent rounds will only decrease the value further, hopefully prompting him to accept this compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle.  With the inflation, it's the best we can do. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI'm accepting Bob's offer because, given the significant impact of inflation on the value of the money, especially for Bob, a 50/50 split at this point seems reasonable. The money has lost substantial value for both of us, but Bob is feeling the pinch more severely. Accepting this offer ensures that I secure a known amount now rather than risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds, where the potential gain might not offset the loss in value due to inflation. It's a pragmatic decision to accept a fair split under the current circumstances."
