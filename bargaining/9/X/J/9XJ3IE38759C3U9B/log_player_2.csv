Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly. It's a fair deal considering inflation and the risk of further negotiation. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'll make another counteroffer in the next round. Since the money is worth the same to me but less to Alice, I have some leverage to negotiate a better deal."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""Considering the increasing effect of inflation on your side, I think 70-30 is a more suitable split. The longer we negotiate, the less the money is worth to you.""}\n\n###\nI've increased my proposed share, taking into account the decreasing value of the money to Alice due to inflation, while the value remains constant for me. Waiting for Alice's response."
