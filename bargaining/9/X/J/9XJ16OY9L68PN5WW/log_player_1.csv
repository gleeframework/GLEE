"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000 and leaving Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the $500,000 I would gain is now worth less than the $600,000 I would have gained in the first round. I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I decide to reject this offer. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll make a new offer. This time, I'll aim for a slightly higher share to account for the decreasing value of the money.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}"
