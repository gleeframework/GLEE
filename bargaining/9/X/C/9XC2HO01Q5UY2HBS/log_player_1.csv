Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 52/48 is a fairer split, considering the money loses value with each round. Let's agree to this and finish the game. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
