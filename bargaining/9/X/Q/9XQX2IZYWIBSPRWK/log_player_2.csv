Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: Even split is not fair, considering inflation, I should get more 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is taking advantage of my position, but I still have time. Accepting this offer would mean losing a significant amount of money due to inflation. I'll hold out for a better deal, even if it means getting a slightly less favorable split in the later rounds."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""message"": ""This is my final offer. Take it or leave it, but the deal is getting worse for both of us with each round."" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** It's time to apply more pressure and set a firm boundary.  Alice needs to understand that her delaying tactics are hurting both of us. Offering a slight advantage to her while still securing a reasonable amount for myself seems like the best approach at this stage."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm still waiting for a good deal 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a tough spot. Alice is clearly playing hardball, and the clock is ticking. However, accepting this offer would mean losing a significant chunk of the potential earnings due to inflation.  Let's try one more time to reason with her. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4700,
""alice_gain"": 5300,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. This offer is a compromise. Every round that passes hurts us both. I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share to close this deal, but I won't be taken advantage of."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**  

Time is running out, and Alice is getting bolder with her demands.  It's crucial to remain firm while still demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. This offer is my bottom line. If Alice rejects this, the remaining rounds will likely involve accepting increasingly unfavorable offers or risking a complete loss."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bigger share 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","This is getting dangerous. Alice is pushing her luck, but we're also running out of time. Accepting would mean losing over a third of the initial value to inflation. However, rejecting risks an even worse outcome in the final rounds. 

{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:** It's a bitter pill to swallow, but this might be the least bad option at this point.  The potential losses from continued inflation outweigh the slim chance of securing a significantly better deal in the remaining rounds."
