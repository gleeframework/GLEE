"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

I propose taking $9,000 and giving Bob $1,000.  This is a good starting point, as it ensures I get the majority of the money while still giving Bob something.  I'll be interested to see if he accepts or wants to make a counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While this offer might seem tempting, I need to consider the long game.  Bob's offer is essentially the reverse of my initial offer, and if I accept, I'll be stuck with a significantly smaller share.  By rejecting, I can force Bob to make another offer in round 3, and the inflation will further decrease the value of his offer.  This gives me a better chance of getting a more favorable split in the future."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8100, ""bob_gain"": 1900}
```

Since Bob rejected my initial offer, I need to adjust my strategy. I'll lower my desired share slightly to $8,100, but still keep a comfortable majority.  I'm increasing Bob's share to $1,900 to incentivize him to accept, as I anticipate the inflation factor will make him less likely to reject offers in the future."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. While it seems tempting to get some money, the inflation is heavily impacting Bob's offer. The fact that Bob is still demanding such a large portion shows he's not taking the inflation seriously.  I'm hoping to force him into a more reasonable offer in the next rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7290, ""bob_gain"": 2710}
```

I'm going to keep lowering my proposed share to $7,290, but I'm also going to increase Bob's share to $2,710. This is a significant increase from the previous round and should show Bob that I am willing to compromise. I'm also hoping that the inflation factor will make him more receptive to my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer.  The inflation is hitting him hard, but he's still trying to get a disproportionately large share. I'm hopeful that the next few rounds will force him to make a more reasonable offer.  I'm also starting to consider the possibility of getting nothing if we can't reach an agreement, but I'm determined to hold out for a fair deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6561, ""bob_gain"": 3439}
```

I'm going to continue my strategy of offering a slightly lower share to me and a slightly higher share to Bob.  My proposed share is now $6,561 and Bob's is $3,439.  I'm hoping that the inflation factor will force Bob to accept a deal that is more in line with what I'm willing to accept."
