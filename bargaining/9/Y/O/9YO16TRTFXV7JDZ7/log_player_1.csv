"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise. This offer gives me a decent amount, but still leaves room for Alice to get a significant share. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
