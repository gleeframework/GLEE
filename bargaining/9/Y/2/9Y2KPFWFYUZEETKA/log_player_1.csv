"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'm going to propose a split where I get 90% and Bob gets 10%. This seems like a fair starting point, considering I'm the one making the first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}

I'm going to reduce my share slightly to 85% and increase Bob's to 15%.  I'm hoping this demonstrates flexibility and encourages him to accept."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}

I'm going to drop my share again, hoping that Bob will see I'm willing to negotiate.  80/20 is still a pretty good deal for me, given the inflation."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to continue to reject Bob's offers.  While he's offering a higher share to me each round, it's still significantly less than what I've been proposing.  I'm confident I can get a better deal if I continue to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}

I'm going to offer Bob 250,000, which is a decent increase from his last offer.  I'm hoping this will show I'm willing to compromise and might lead to an agreement before we lose too much to inflation."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob 300,000 this round, which is a significant increase from his last offer. With only a few rounds left, I'm hoping this will be enough to get him to accept. I'm still aiming for a larger share, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of the shrinking pot."
