"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor, which is a relatively generous offer considering I'm the first to propose."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering we'll both be losing value over time. Let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $45 is worth 5% less than the $60 I would have gotten in the first round, so it's actually worth $54.75.

I'm not too thrilled about the 55/45 split, but it's a decent offer considering the circumstances. I'll accept it to avoid further negotiations.
