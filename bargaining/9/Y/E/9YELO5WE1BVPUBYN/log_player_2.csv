# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly trying to negotiate me down, but the game isn't over yet. I need to hold firm and show I'm serious about a more equitable split. There's still time for a better offer."

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous! Take this offer, it's more than fair. Don't let us both end up with nothing! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** While I'd prefer a more even split, time is running out. Accepting this offer guarantees a significant sum, while continuing to reject Alice's offers risks ending up with nothing. It's a compromise, but a safer choice at this stage."
