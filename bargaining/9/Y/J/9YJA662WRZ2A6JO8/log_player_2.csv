Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation working against her, and her offers are slowly creeping towards a more even split. However, I'm still willing to hold out for a better deal.  Time is running out, but there's still a chance to secure a larger portion of the money."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time.  This is a fair and equal split, especially considering the inflation we're both facing.  Take it or leave it."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to play hardball.  While I could try to push for a slightly larger share, the even split is the most logical offer at this point.  It eliminates the need for further negotiation and guarantees I get a reasonable amount of money before inflation eats away at the value even more.  This offer also highlights that I understand the pressure Alice is under, making it more likely she'll accept."
