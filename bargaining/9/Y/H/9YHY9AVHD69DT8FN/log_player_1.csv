I'm going for a bold strategy.  I'm offering Bob a tiny share, hoping he'll accept it rather than risk getting nothing at all in the later rounds.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. He's trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I'm not going to let him get away with it!  I'll be the one making the offer in the next round and I'll be aiming for a much fairer split."

I'm still trying to maximize my share, but I'm offering Bob a slightly larger percentage this time to show that I'm willing to negotiate.  Hopefully, this will convince him to accept and avoid further rounds of inflation."

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer.  He's getting greedy, and I'm not going to let him take advantage of the inflation.  I know we only have a few rounds left, so I'll need to be more strategic in my next offer."

I'm increasing Bob's share again, but still keeping the majority for myself. The pressure is on, and I need to convince him to accept before inflation eats away at our potential gains even further.  Let's see how he reacts."

Bob is getting more and more aggressive, but I'm not backing down. I know the inflation is hitting him harder, but I'm still in a strong position. I need to hold out for a better deal."

I'm offering Bob a significant increase, but I'm still holding onto the larger share.  The pressure is mounting with each passing round, and I need to strike a balance between securing a decent amount for myself and convincing Bob to accept before the inflation completely erodes our potential gains."
