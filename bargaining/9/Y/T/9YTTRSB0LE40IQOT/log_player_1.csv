I'm going to start by being generous, but also trying to secure a large portion of the money.  I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a decent starting point. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being greedy! I'm going to reject his offer and see if he's willing to negotiate further. There's still a lot of money on the table, and I'm not going to settle for such a small share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway this time. I'm increasing my offer to $600,000, while still giving Bob a significant portion of the money. Let's see if he's more willing to compromise now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still being stubborn, and I'm not going to settle for a 450,000 share.  I'm going to hold out for a better deal. There are still rounds left, and the money is losing value quickly.  Hopefully, Bob will realize that he needs to compromise sooner rather than later."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

I'm going to slightly increase my offer again, aiming for a more balanced split. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to accept, as the value of the money is decreasing with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse, and I'm still not going to accept it. I'm hoping that the decreasing value of the money will make him realize that he needs to compromise. There are still rounds left, and I'm not going to give up without a fight."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

This is getting serious.  We are running out of time, and the money is worth significantly less than before. I'm going to try to compromise with Bob and offer an even split. I hope he finally sees the value in a fair deal."
