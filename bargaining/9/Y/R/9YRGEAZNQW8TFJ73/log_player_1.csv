"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is 20% of the total amount. This leaves me with $8,000, which is 80% of the total amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle.  Fair is fair! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round. 

I'll evaluate Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not bad, but I was hoping for a bit more. You're leaving me with less than I initially offered you.""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and looking forward to making a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 81% of what it was in the first round.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is 40% of the total amount, and keeping $6,000 for myself, which is 60% of the total amount."
