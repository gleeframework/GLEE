"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous. Take 10,000 and we'll be done with this. 
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
1,000,000 is a lot of money, and Bob can likely do better. Let's see what Alice offers next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000, ""message"": ""I think it's only fair that we split the money more evenly. I'm offering you 100,000, and I'll take the rest. What do you say?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need the majority share. Take 50,000 and let's call it a day. 
# Bob gain: 50000 
# Alice gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Bob should still try to get a bigger share.  Even with the inflation, the offer is still very lopsided. Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think we can find a more equitable solution. I'm offering you 400,000 and taking 600,000 for myself. It's a fair split considering we both have an equal say in this.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer.  Take 200,000, or we both lose everything. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob has already lost almost 20% of the value of his potential earnings due to inflation.  While this is a bad deal for Bob, he's risking a lot if he keeps rejecting offers. This offer will at least give him a decent chunk of change, and if he keeps rejecting, he could lose it all."
