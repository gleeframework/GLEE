"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. This is a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 20% less than the original $6,000, so I'm looking at $4,800.

Bob's offer is to meet in the middle, which is a 50-50 split. I'm not sure if I want to give up my advantage, but I also don't want to risk going to the next round and losing even more value due to inflation.
