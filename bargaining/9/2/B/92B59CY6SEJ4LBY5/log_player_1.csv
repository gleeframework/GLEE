"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

I'm offering you $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my expectations. In this round, my gain of $250,000 is worth 80% of its original value, which is $200,000, and Bob's gain of $750,000 is worth 90% of its original value, which is $675,000.

I'll accept this offer.
