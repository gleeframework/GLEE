I'm going to try to get the majority of the money.  Since I lose 20% of the value of the money with each round, I want to get as much as possible now!  Let's see what Bob thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer. While I'm losing 20% of the value of the money each round, Bob is only losing 5%. This means that the money I'm getting is losing value faster, but Bob is getting a better deal each round. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm going to offer a slightly better deal to Bob this round.  He rejected my last offer, so I need to give him something more enticing.  However, I still want to maximize my gains, so I'm only offering him 3000.  Let's see if he'll accept this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough one!  The money is losing value quickly for me, and Bob is still getting a decent deal with his 5% inflation rate.  However, in the next round I'm going to lose almost half the value of the money I gain!  It's better to accept this offer and get at least 5,000."
