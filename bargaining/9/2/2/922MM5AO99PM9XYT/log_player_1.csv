"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial amount, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money, I'll have to be more cautious. Bob's offer is still quite close to the initial proposal I made, but I'd like to try to get a bit more. I'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In round 3, the money is worth 20% less than in round 2, so I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000
}
```

This way, I'll get a bit more than Bob's previous offer, and I'll try to make it more attractive for him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the significant decrease in the value of money, Bob's offer seems more reasonable now. Since we're getting close to the deadline, I'll consider accepting this offer.
