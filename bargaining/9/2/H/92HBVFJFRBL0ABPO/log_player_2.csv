"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we divide the funds with an 80/20 split in favor of Alice. This allows us both to benefit from the initial amount, while still ensuring a significant portion goes to Alice. 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While a 2000$ gain is tempting, it's crucial to consider the inflation. Accepting this offer means missing out on a chance to potentially negotiate a better deal later. By rejecting, Bob retains the opportunity to propose a more favorable split in the next round, considering the declining value of money."
