"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair and reasonable start""}

I'm proposing that I get 60 dollars and Bob gets 40 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You got lucky last round, now it's my turn to take the lead 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think I'm getting a good deal with this offer. I was hoping to get more than 20 dollars, considering the initial 100 dollars was a decent amount. I'll reject this offer and hope to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, let's split it 40-60 and move on""}

I'm proposing a 40-60 split, which is a bit more favorable to Bob this time around, but I still think it's a reasonable compromise."
