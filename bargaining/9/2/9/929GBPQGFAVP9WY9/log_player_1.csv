"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it 60-40""
}
```

I'm being generous and offering Bob 40% of the total amount, while I take 60%. It's a fair offer, considering I'm the one making the first proposal. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your turn Alice.  How about a slightly better deal for me this time? Remember, the clock is ticking and the money is worth less with each round. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 57,
  ""bob_gain"": 43,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve the bigger share""
}
```

I've reduced my share slightly to show that I'm willing to negotiate, but I still believe I should get the larger share. Let's see if Bob accepts this offer!"
