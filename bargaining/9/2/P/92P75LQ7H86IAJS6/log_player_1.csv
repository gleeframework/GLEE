Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can reassess as we go along.""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets the remaining 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a small share, but I think I deserve more since I'm making the offer this time. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with the 30% offer. I was hoping for a more even split, especially since I'm the one who made the initial offer. I think I deserve a better share, especially considering the money is worth less due to inflation. I'll reject this offer and hope to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share, but I still think I deserve a bigger chunk.""}

I'm proposing that I get 45% of the remaining $100, which is $45, and Bob gets the remaining 55%, which is $55."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going to give you a huge share, but I'm willing to give you a small chance at getting something. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled with the 20% offer, especially considering the money is worth less due to inflation. I was hoping for a better share, and I'm not willing to settle for such a small portion. I'll reject this offer and try to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a 50/50 split. Let's make a fair deal and end this game.""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which means we both get $50. I think this is a fair compromise, and it's a good opportunity to end the game and avoid further losses due to inflation."
