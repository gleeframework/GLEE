"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose a 90/10 split, giving myself $900,000 and Bob $100,000. I'm aiming for a large share in the first round, hoping Bob will accept to avoid the risk of inflation affecting his potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While the offer gives me a substantial amount, the inflation makes it less attractive. If I reject, I can propose a better deal for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split.  Bob's offer was less attractive due to inflation, and I believe he's likely to accept a more equitable distribution, especially considering the money will be worth less for him in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Although the offer is not ideal, the inflation has heavily impacted Bob's share. If I reject, I risk getting an even smaller portion in the next round, and the inflation will continue to decrease Bob's potential gains. It's better to accept and secure a significant amount now."
