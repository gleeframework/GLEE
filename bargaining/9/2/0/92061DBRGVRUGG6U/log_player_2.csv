Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Alice's offer was 4000 for me and 6000 for her, I'll try to counter with a slightly better offer. But I'll keep in mind that the money is worth 10% less each round, so I'll aim for a higher share.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With the money worth 19% less than in the first round and 57% less than in the second round, I'll aim for an even higher share. I'll try to get as close to 50/50 as possible.
