"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money in a 3:1 ratio. This ensures a fair split considering the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly higher share this round, but I'm not willing to go as high as 3:1. This is a fair compromise, considering the value of money is decreasing for you. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
