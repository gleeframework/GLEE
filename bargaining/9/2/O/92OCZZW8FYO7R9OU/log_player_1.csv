# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not convinced by Bob's slight adjustment. I'd like to make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll propose a new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle at 50-50, a fair compromise!""}

I think this is a more reasonable split, considering the money is worth less now."
