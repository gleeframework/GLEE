"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000 and leaving Bob with 40%. I'm framing it as a fair starting point, but we'll see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slightly more generous offer, let's see if you'll take it! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of 200,000 is now worth 160,000 (80% of 200,000). That's not a bad deal, but I'm not sure if I should settle for it.

I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, my gain of 200,000 is now worth 160,000 (80% of 200,000). I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreased value of the money.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""A more balanced split, considering the inflation!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 42% of the remaining $800,000 (1,000,000 - 200,000), leaving Bob with 58%. I'm hoping this offer is more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a risk and offer you a smaller share, but I think it's worth it! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money! With the inflation effect, my gain of 100,000 is now worth 51,200 (48.8% of 100,000).

Considering the offer, I'm not thrilled with the 5% share, but I don't want to risk waiting for another round and potentially getting an even smaller share.

I'll accept the offer.
