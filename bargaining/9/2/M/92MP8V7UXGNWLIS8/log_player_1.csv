Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think I deserve a bit more. Let's try to find a better balance. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I think this is a fair offer, considering the decreasing value of the money due to inflation. Meeting in the middle at 50-50 seems like a reasonable compromise, and I'm willing to accept it."
