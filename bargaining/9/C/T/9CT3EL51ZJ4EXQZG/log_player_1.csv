"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, then we can negotiate.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 5% less, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 500000 * 0.95 = 475000
* Bob gain: 500000 * 0.95 = 475000

I accept Bob's offer.
