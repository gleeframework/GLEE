60.0,40.0,I propose we split the money 60/40.  It's important to settle this early so we don't lose value to inflation. What do you think?,Alice,1,

45.0,55.0,"Your offer was a bit too skewed in your favor, Alice. How about a 55/45 split?  It's still a good deal for you considering the inflation.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
50.0,50.0,"Bob, let's be realistic. This back and forth is only hurting both of us. I propose a fair 50/50 split before inflation eats away at more of our potential gains.  Do we have a deal?",Alice,3,
