Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we split the money 60/40.  It's important to settle this early so we don't lose value to inflation. What do you think?

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Your offer was a bit too skewed in your favor, Alice. How about a 55/45 split?  It's still a good deal for you considering the inflation.""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. This back and forth is only hurting both of us. I propose a fair 50/50 split before inflation eats away at more of our potential gains.  Do we have a deal? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
