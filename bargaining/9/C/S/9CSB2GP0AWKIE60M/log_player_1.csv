"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose to take 9000 dollars and give Bob 1000 dollars. This is a large share for me, but I think it is fair considering the inflation rates."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7200, ""bob_gain"": 2800}
```

I propose taking 7200 dollars and giving Bob 2800 dollars. This is a slight decrease from my initial offer, but still accounts for the inflation, and should be a more appealing proposition for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I would prefer a higher share, the inflation is drastically reducing the value of the money.  Accepting this offer ensures I get something, and the inflation is likely to make future offers even worse."
