"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'm willing to compromise.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $100, which is $40, and keeping 60% for myself, which is $60."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bigger share, but not that big 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $70 is now worth $56, and Bob's gain of $30 is now worth $27.

I'll consider Bob's offer. It's a bit more generous than my initial offer, but still not as generous as I would like. I'll decide to reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no more negotiations.""
}
```

I'm now offering a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept this fair offer."
