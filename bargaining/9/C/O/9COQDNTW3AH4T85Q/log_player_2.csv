**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the situation,  but her offers are getting greedier while the value decreases. It's time to show I'm serious about getting a fair share.  We are getting close to the point where accepting a less favorable deal might be better than risking it all."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""This is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the only fair solution. Take it or leave it, the clock is ticking.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The game has reached a critical point.  Continuously rejecting offers and proposing increasingly smaller gains for Alice is too risky now. Offering a 50/50 split is:

* **Fair:** It eliminates any argument of greed and emphasizes the shrinking pot.
* **Decisive:** It puts the pressure on Alice. Continued refusal makes her look unreasonable and increases the risk of losing everything. 
* **Strategic:** While not ideal, accepting a less favorable deal now is better than potentially getting nothing in later rounds."
