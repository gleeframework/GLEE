Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'll propose a split that's more favorable to me. Let's see if Alice takes it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While it would be nice to get more, the inflation is starting to bite, and I'm not sure I can get a better deal. I'll take what I can get."
