"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it fairly, but I'll take a bit more 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more careful with the inflation in mind.

I accept Bob's offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```
I'll take $6,000 and Bob will take $4,000."
