Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation working against me. I need to hold firm and hope she gets more agreeable as the rounds progress."

# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a tough one, but I need to start considering the impact of inflation.  While 4300 is much less than I aimed for, rejecting this offer means risking getting even less in the next round.  Alice seems unwilling to budge much, so it's better to take what I can get at this point."
