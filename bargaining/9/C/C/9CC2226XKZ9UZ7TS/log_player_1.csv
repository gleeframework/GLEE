"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going for a high share, aiming for 9000$.  I figure Bob will probably counter with a more even split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would have preferred my initial proposal, I don't want to risk getting nothing. My gains are reduced by 10% each round, while Bob's are reduced by 20%, so this offer is likely the best I can do."
