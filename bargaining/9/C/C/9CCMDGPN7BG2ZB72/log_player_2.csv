Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, let's be reasonable! 58% for me, 42% for you is a good deal, considering the inflation! 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm giving you one more chance. 57% for me is the lowest I'll go! 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

At this point, the effects of inflation are starting to significantly hurt Bob's potential gains. While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob receives some amount of money, which is better than continuing to lose value with each passing round.
