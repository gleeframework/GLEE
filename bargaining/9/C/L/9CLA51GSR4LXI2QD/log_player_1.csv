"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going for a high initial offer to see if Bob is willing to take a smaller share early on. We'll see how he reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would have preferred to keep a larger share, it's better to secure a gain than risk getting nothing due to inflation."
