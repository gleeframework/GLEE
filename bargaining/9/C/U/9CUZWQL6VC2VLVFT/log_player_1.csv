This is a fair starting offer. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer.  While I'm losing nothing due to inflation, Bob is getting a better deal with each passing round.  I'll try to get a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm increasing my proposed share to 60, hoping to incentivize Bob to accept. The inflation is hurting him more than me now, so he might be more willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I still reject this offer. Even with the inflation hitting Bob harder, he's still trying to get a bigger share than me. I'm going to see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm raising my offer again, hoping to reach a compromise.  The inflation is really hitting Bob now, and he might be willing to accept something closer to a 70/30 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is getting increasingly greedy, and the inflation is really hurting him.  I'll keep pushing for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm going for a bold move and increasing my share to 80%.  Inflation is really hurting Bob now, and this might be the only way to reach an agreement.  He might be willing to take anything at this point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 28 
# Bob gain: 72 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is becoming increasingly unreasonable.  Even with the heavy inflation against him, he's trying to get an even bigger share. I'm not going to accept this. I'll try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

This is my final offer. Inflation is hitting Bob hard, and he's likely desperate at this point.  I'm giving him the smallest possible share, hoping he accepts to avoid losing even more to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough decision, but given how much inflation is affecting Bob, I'm going to accept his offer. I'm getting significantly less than I initially hoped for, but at this point, anything is better than the alternative."
