"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I still have the same value of money in mind. But since Bob's offer is 60, which is worth 10% less than 66.67 (the 60% of 100 that Bob is effectively proposing), I'll reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer was 60, which is worth 10% less than 66.67, I'll propose a 60-40 split, which is worth 66.67-33.33 in effective value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the effective value of Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the original 100 dollars. Bob's offer is 55, which is worth 55 / (1 - 0.271) = 55 / 0.729 = 75.34 in effective value. This is worth 55% of the original 100 dollars, which is 55. Since 55 is worth 55% of the original, and I want to get 50, which is 50% of the original, I will reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer was 55, which is worth 75.34 in effective value, I'll propose a 50-50 split, which is worth 50% of the original 100 dollars, but since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll propose a 50-50 split in terms of the original value.
