"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly, considering I'm taking the risk of inflation.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a generous 40% of the total amount, while I take $600,000, which is 60%. Given that I'm the one facing the risk of inflation, I believe this is a reasonable proposal. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split this evenly, as neither of us knows how much the inflation will affect the next rounds.  We both get the same amount now, and we don't have to worry about the potential loss. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 580000,
  ""bob_gain"": 420000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, my share is actually less than it seems. I think this is a fair compromise.""
}
```

Given that the money I gain is now worth 10% less than the original amount (and will continue to decrease), I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share than before. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, taking into account the impact of inflation on my gains. Let's see if Bob agrees!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to be fair with the inflation in mind. I'm offering you a slightly smaller share to make up for the reduced value of your portion. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 560000,
  ""bob_gain"": 440000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting a better deal due to inflation, so I think this split is more than fair.""
}
```

I'm taking into account the fact that the money I gain is now worth significantly less than the original amount, and adjusting my offer accordingly. I still think I deserve a slightly larger share, considering the impact of inflation on my gains. Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this proposal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm increasing my share slightly to account for the continued inflation.  I believe this is still a fair offer, considering your share is decreasing in value with each round. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000,
  ""message"": ""Inflation is taking a big bite, but I still want a fair share. This is my compromise.""
}
```

Given that the money I gain is now worth nearly 41% less than the original amount, I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and acknowledging the impact of inflation. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable proposal, considering the circumstances."
