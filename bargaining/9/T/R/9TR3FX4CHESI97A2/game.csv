60.0,40.0,"Let's be fair, Bob. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  It benefits us both to settle this quickly.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
40.0,60.0,"Alice, your offer was heavily skewed in your favor. I'm proposing a 60/40 split for me this time.  Consider that the value decreases significantly for both of us if we wait.",Bob,2,
,,"While I understand the pressure of inflation, Bob, a 60/40 split in your favor is not acceptable. Let's find a more equitable solution.",Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"Bob, time is ticking and the value is dropping. I'm willing to compromise. How about a 55/45 split in my favor? It's a better deal than you'll get if we wait much longer.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
45.0,55.0,"Alice, I understand the time pressure, but your idea of compromise is still tilted in your favor. I'll meet you halfway - 55/45 my way this time. Let's settle this before the money shrinks further.",Bob,4,
,,"This is getting ridiculous, Bob.  You're just trying to flip the script instead of negotiating fairly.  We need to find a genuine middle ground quickly.",Alice,4,reject
52.0,48.0,"Bob, this is getting us nowhere. I'm offering a 52/48 split in my favor. It's a small advantage for me, but we're both losing money fast. Let's be reasonable and close this deal.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
48.0,52.0,"Alice, I'm willing to end this stand-off.  I'll take the slight loss this round and accept a 52/48 split, but in MY favor this time. Take it or leave it - we're both losing serious money waiting.",Bob,6,
,,"Alright, Bob. I'll accept the 48/52 split in your favor. It's not ideal, but we're both losing money with every passing round. Let's settle this now.",Alice,6,accept
