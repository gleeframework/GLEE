"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor, as the first proposer. I'm hoping this is fair enough for Bob to accept, but I also want to secure a good chunk of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation is starting to affect the value of the money.  Accepting this offer ensures I get something, and it's only a small decrease from the initial offer."
