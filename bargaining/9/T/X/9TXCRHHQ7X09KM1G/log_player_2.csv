Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

**Reasoning:**

At this point, it's clear Alice is driving a hard bargain and is content to let inflation erode Bob's potential gains. While $4,300 is significantly less than Bob's initial goal, accepting is better than risking another rejection. 

If Bob rejects this offer, there's a high chance Alice will offer even less in the next round, further diminishing Bob's returns due to the continued inflation. Accepting now cuts the losses and secures a reasonable, though not ideal, sum."
