"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get a good start, I'll give you a fair share!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself. This way, we can both get a decent amount and have a good starting point for the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation has already taken its toll. My proposed gain of $700,000 in Round 1 is now worth less, but I'm still in a stronger position.

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a reasonable compromise, but I'd like to try to get a better deal. I'll reject this offer and make a counter-proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I want a slightly higher share""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is taking its toll, and my potential gain is now worth even less. I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to prioritize my own gain""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer or not."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think it's fair 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll now. My potential gain is worth significantly less than it was in the first round.

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a bit more favorable to him than my previous offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll think carefully before making a decision.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to think about it, but I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and see if I can do better in the next round."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really affecting the value of the money now. My potential gain is worth a significant amount less than it was in the first round.

Considering the value of the money is decreasing rapidly, I'll make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, but I need a better deal to make it worth my while""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer or not."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I think it's getting close to fair 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll now. My potential gain is worth a significant fraction of what it was in the first round.

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's getting closer to a fair deal, but I'm not sure if I should accept it. I'm running out of options, and the value of the money is decreasing rapidly.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""I'll take it, it's getting too late to negotiate further""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer and take $400,000. It's not the best deal I could have gotten, but it's better than walking away with nothing."
