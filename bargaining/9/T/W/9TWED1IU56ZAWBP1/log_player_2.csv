Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the situation.  While my share is dwindling, I'm not going to accept an offer this low. It's a gamble, but I think I can still get her to agree to a more even split."

This is a tough decision, but with the rate of inflation, I'm in real danger of getting nothing. Accepting Alice's offer, while far from ideal, is the safest option at this point."
