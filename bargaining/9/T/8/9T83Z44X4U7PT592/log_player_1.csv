"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a more fair split. Let's agree and end this game. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","### Step 1: Calculate the adjusted value of the money for both Alice and Bob after two rounds of inflation.
For Alice, the money is worth 5% less each round, so after two rounds, the value is 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.9025 of the original.
For Bob, the money is worth 10% less each round, so after two rounds, the value is 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 of the original.

### Step 2: Determine a new offer that takes into account the adjusted values and aims to find a mutually acceptable split.
Considering the adjusted values, Alice's share from the previous offer would be worth less now, so she might want to adjust her offer to compensate for the loss in value due to inflation.

### Step 3: Formulate the offer in the required JSON format.
Given the considerations above, Alice might decide to adjust her offer to ensure she doesn't lose out due to inflation, while still trying to find a compromise that Bob might accept.

The final answer is: {""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's compromise.""}"
