"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and reasonable for the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $4000 is worth less than I initially thought. I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'm not accepting this offer. I'd like to make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll aim for a slightly higher share for myself. Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800
}

I'm proposing a 42-58 split, hoping it's more favorable for me than the previous offer."
