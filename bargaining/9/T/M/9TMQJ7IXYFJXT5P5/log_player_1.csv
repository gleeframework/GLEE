"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can both go home happy!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is 40% of the original amount, and I'll take the remaining $600,000. This way, we both get a significant amount of money, and I'm showing my willingness to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair.  This is a more equitable split. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants to mirror my initial offer, but I'm not impressed. Since the money is worth 5% less for me now, I'd rather negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer, hoping to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me now (5% less than the previous round), I'll aim for a higher share to compensate for the decrease in value. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a bit more to account for inflation.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share, but I'm still being generous considering the decreasing value of the money."
