"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split and see if we can negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a 50/50 split, it's a good starting point 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $5,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, so it's actually $4,500.

I'm not sure if I want to accept a 50-50 split, considering the value of my gain is slightly lower due to inflation. I'd like to try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 10% less than in Round 2, my gain of $5,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, so it's actually $4,500.

I'll offer a slightly higher amount to Bob, while keeping my gain at the same value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not willing to go below 45% of the total.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more, considering the initial offer was 60/40 in my favor 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $4,500 in Round 3 is now worth 72.9% of its original value, so it's actually $3,265.50.

Considering the money is worth less due to inflation, I'm not sure if I want to accept an offer that gives Bob a higher share. However, I do want to end the game, so I'll accept this offer.
