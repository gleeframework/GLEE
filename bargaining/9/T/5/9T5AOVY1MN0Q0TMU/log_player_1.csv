"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $80 and Bob gets $20, which seems like a fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. 50/50 seems like the most sensible way to split the money. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 20% less than before.

Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, which is a reasonable proposal. However, considering the inflation, I'd rather get a bit more than 50% to account for the decreased value of the money. But since it's a fair proposal, I'll accept it to avoid further negotiations.
