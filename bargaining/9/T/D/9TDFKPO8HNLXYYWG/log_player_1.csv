"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

This way, we both get $5,000, and we can end the game on a high note. What do you think, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth 20% less for me due to inflation, I'd rather get more now than less later. However, Bob's offer is a bit lopsided, and I'm not sure if I want to give him a bigger share.

I'll reject this offer for now and try to negotiate further. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer, I'll make a new proposal that takes into account the decreasing value of money.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800
}
```

This way, I'm getting a slightly higher share, but still leaving room for Bob to negotiate further. What do you think, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value. With the money being worth 48.8% less for me, I'm getting a bit more cautious.

Considering Bob's previous offer was 5800, this new offer of 4500 is a bit lower, but still not bad considering the inflation. I'll accept this offer to get some certainty and end the game.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
