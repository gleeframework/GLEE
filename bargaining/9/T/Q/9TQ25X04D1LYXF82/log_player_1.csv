"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 90-10, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount, hoping he'll want to negotiate and we can play more rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting strong, but I'll take a bit more this round 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to reject it. His gain of $700,000 is quite large, and I'm not willing to give up that much. I'll try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob! Let's make a deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a larger share than last time, but still keeping a significant amount for myself. Let's see if he'll accept this compromise!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, but I'll take the tiebreaker 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants to tie the game!

I'll accept this offer, as it's a fair 50-50 split. Let's call it a draw!

  ""decision"": ""accept""
