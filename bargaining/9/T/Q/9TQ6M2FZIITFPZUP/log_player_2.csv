"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money fairly. I'll take 60% and you get 40%.

# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see what Alice proposes next! I'm sure we can find a more favorable deal for me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 7000,
""alice_gain"": 3000,
""message"": ""I propose a 70/30 split. It's a fair deal, considering the inflation we're dealing with.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take 40%, and you can have 60%. It's a good deal for both of us, considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 6000 
# Alice gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred a larger share, this is a good deal considering the inflation.  It's better than the last round, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the future."
