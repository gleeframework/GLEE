"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and end the game!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair and reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 400,000, but I think I deserve more for my negotiation skills 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with this offer. I think I deserve more than 40% of the total amount, considering the initial offer I made was 50/50. Bob's offer is too lopsided in his favor. I'll reject this offer and make a new one."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share for my initial 50/50 proposal""}

I'm adjusting my offer to try to get a slightly better deal, while still being reasonable and willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 300,000, but I think my negotiation skills are worth more than that 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm extremely unhappy with this offer. The value of the money I gain is already significantly reduced due to inflation, and now Bob is trying to give me only 30% of the original amount. I think this is an extremely unfair offer, and I'll reject it. I'll try to make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 375000, ""bob_gain"": 625000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to accept a slightly smaller share, but I think this is the minimum I can accept considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation""}

I'm trying to be more realistic about the value of the money and adjust my expectations accordingly. I'm willing to accept a smaller share, but I still think this is a reasonable compromise."
