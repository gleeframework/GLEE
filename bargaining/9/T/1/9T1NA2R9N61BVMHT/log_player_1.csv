Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. This is a significant amount, and I hope he'll accept it.  However, I want to see how he reacts to this first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the inflation has significantly impacted my potential gains, accepting this offer is still a better outcome than risking further rounds and potential losses.  I'm willing to accept this offer as it secures a considerable amount for me, even with the devaluation."
