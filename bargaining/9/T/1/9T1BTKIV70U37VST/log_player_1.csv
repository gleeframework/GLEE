"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 equally, with each of us getting $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but still a fair offer! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too thrilled about the reduced gain due to inflation, but I'll consider Bob's offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me only $4,000, especially since the money is worth less than it was in the first round. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'll take a slightly larger share this time, but still a fair compromise!""}

I'm proposing that I take a slightly larger share of the $10,000, getting $6,000, and leaving $4,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly bigger share this time, but I still think I deserve more! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my gains!

After considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about the reduced gain, but I'll think carefully about it.

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept Bob's offer, hoping that it's the best I can get at this point. Getting $4,500 is better than nothing, and I'm willing to compromise to avoid going back to the drawing board."
