Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 51, ""bob_gain"": 49}

I propose a 51/49 split in my favor. This is a fair starting point, and I believe it is in both our best interests to reach an agreement quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I propose an even split.  Since Bob rejected my previous offer, I think it's important to show that I'm willing to compromise for a fair outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Bob's offers are getting increasingly unfair, and the value of the money is rapidly decreasing. I'm willing to compromise, but I won't accept a deal that drastically favors him."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}

I'm willing to give up a bit more to reach an agreement.  This offer is still more favorable to me, but it shows I'm trying to find a solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is becoming increasingly unfair, and the value of the money is rapidly decreasing. I will not accept this offer. I believe I can do better by continuing to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60}
```

I'm making a final concession. I believe this offer is a fair compromise given the circumstances, and it is still better than what Bob has offered. If we don't reach an agreement now, we risk losing a significant amount of money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

This offer is simply unacceptable. The value of the money is rapidly decreasing, and Bob is taking advantage of the situation by offering me a ridiculously small share. I will not accept this offer and will continue to negotiate for a fairer outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 35, ""bob_gain"": 65}
```

We are getting dangerously close to the end of the game and the value of the money is continuing to decrease. I'm lowering my requested share to 35% to show my willingness to compromise. 
This offer is a fair balance between my need for a reasonable share and the dwindling value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being extremely unreasonable. I refuse to accept such a paltry sum. It's clear he's trying to exploit the declining value of the money. I'm willing to negotiate, but I will not settle for such a lopsided split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 30, ""bob_gain"": 70}
```

With only two rounds remaining, we are in a very precarious situation. The value of the money is rapidly declining, and if we don't reach an agreement soon, we risk losing everything.  I am willing to make a final compromise, but I will not accept any offer that is significantly less than this one."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 43.12% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is completely unreasonable and a clear attempt to take advantage of the dwindling value of the money. I will not accept such a paltry sum, especially given the rapidly declining value of the money. Unfortunately, it seems like we both failed to reach an agreement and will receive nothing."
