{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, your offer was a bit too lopsided. Let's be reasonable. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor.  This accounts for the time value and gives us both a decent share.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting us nowhere. We're losing money over this. I'm proposing a 50/50 split to end this fairly before inflation eats away at our gains. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
