"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'm open to negotiation!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to start with. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take this! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, I didn't expect Bob to be so aggressive!

Considering the inflation, my gain of $300,000 is actually worth 80% of what it was in the first round, which is $240,000. This is a pretty lopsided split, and I'm not sure I want to accept it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain will be worth even less in the next round, so I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's make a deal!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a more aggressive move considering the inflation. Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I want more! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, another rejection!

Considering the inflation, my gain of $450,000 is actually worth about 45% of what it was in the first round, which is $450,000. This is a pretty close split, but I'm still not sure I want to accept it.

I'm starting to think Bob is trying to squeeze me out.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","It's getting tougher to make ends meet with the inflation eating away at my potential gains. I'll try to make another aggressive move to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""bob_gain"": 600000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not getting squeezed out, meet me at this price!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 40-60 split, which is a more aggressive move considering the inflation. Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging, this is my final offer! 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","It's getting tough to make ends meet, and my potential gain is dwindling rapidly due to inflation. Considering the offer, my gain of $350,000 is actually worth about 35% of what it was in the first round, which is $350,000.

I'm not sure if I can do better, and Bob seems determined to get the better deal. I'll have to think carefully...
