"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'm willing to give you a decent amount, but I'm not going to give away too much.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is 40% of the initial amount, and I'll take the remaining 60%. This is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a slightly bigger share, but I'm still open to negotiations. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $300,000 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, which is $240,000. Bob's gain of $700,000 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, which is $380,000.

I'm not thrilled about giving Bob such a large share, but I'm willing to negotiate further. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with this offer. I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'd like to propose a compromise.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my gain is worth 64% of what it was in the first round, which is $384,000. Bob's gain is worth 90.25% of what it was in the first round, which is $357,500.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I still want to keep some control over the majority of the funds.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bigger share considering the value of the money has decreased. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $200,000 is worth 20% of what it was in the first round, which is $200,000. Bob's gain of $800,000 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, which is $800,000.

I'm not thrilled about giving Bob such a large share, especially considering the value of the money has decreased. However, I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid further negotiations and potential losses due to inflation.
