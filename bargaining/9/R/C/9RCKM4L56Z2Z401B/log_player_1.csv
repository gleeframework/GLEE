"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a fairly generous offer, giving Bob 10% of the money. This is a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to accept a deal quickly or if he's aiming for a larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is significantly less generous than my initial proposal, it's still a substantial amount of money. However, I'm not willing to accept such a large disparity, especially given the inflationary effect on my potential earnings. Rejecting this offer gives me the opportunity to make a counter-proposal in the next round and potentially negotiate a more favorable outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

**Explanation:**

Since Bob rejected my previous offer, I'm lowering my proposed share slightly to 60% but still offering Bob a substantial amount.  I'm hoping this demonstrates flexibility while still ensuring I receive a reasonable portion of the money. The inflationary effect is becoming a concern, so I need to be more assertive in securing a good deal."
