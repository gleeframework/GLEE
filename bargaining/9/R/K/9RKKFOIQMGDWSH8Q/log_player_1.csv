"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20, I'll take the smaller share this round""
}
```

This way, I'm taking a smaller share this round, hoping to negotiate a better deal in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split is fairer.  Let's see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $4000 is now worth 90% of its original value, so it's actually worth $3600.

I don't think a 60-40 split is fair, considering I'm already taking a bigger hit from inflation. I'd like to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my gain is worth 90% of its original value, so I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll compromise on a 55-45 split, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation""
}
```

I'm trying to get a slightly better deal, considering the reduced value of money due to inflation."
