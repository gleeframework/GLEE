Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer. I'm willing to meet you halfway on your last offer. Let's split it 70/30. This is still a good deal for both of us, and we can avoid further inflation.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time. Let's be reasonable. This offer is still more advantageous for me than your last one, and it gets us closer to a conclusion. I propose a 60/40 split. Let's end this. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

While I'd prefer a 55/45 split, accepting Alice's offer of 60/40 in Round 5 is the most strategically sound decision at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The longer the game continues, the less valuable the potential winnings become for Alice. This puts pressure on her to reach an agreement.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  While I'd gain more in a 55/45 split, the difference between 400,000 and 550,000 is less significant than the potential loss if Alice decides to push the game further and the deal becomes even less favorable. 
* **Securing a Win:** Accepting now guarantees a significant sum of money. Rejecting this offer risks ending up with a much smaller amount if Alice plays aggressively in the next round. 

It's a tough call, but sometimes a good deal in hand is better than the hope of a slightly better deal that might evaporate.
