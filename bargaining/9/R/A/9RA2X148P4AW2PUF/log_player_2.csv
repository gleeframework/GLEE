Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:

**Reasoning:**

At this point, the game dynamics have shifted significantly:

* **Alice's losses:** Inflation is severely impacting Alice's potential gains. Her current offer, while still favoring her, is notably closer to an even split due to the devaluation.
* **Final round approaching:** If I reject this offer, the game likely ends in the next round. In that round, Alice would be acutely aware of the impending finality and might propose an even less favorable split.
* **Certainty vs. Risk:** Accepting guarantees me $4,300. Rejecting risks getting a worse deal, potentially even less than what I'm offered now. 

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in Round 5 secures a reasonable amount and avoids the risk of ending up with a significantly smaller share in the final round."
