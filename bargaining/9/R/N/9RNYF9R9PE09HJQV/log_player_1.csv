"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This way, I get the majority of the money, but Bob still gets a decent share. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation affecting the money I gain, I need to be more cautious. Since Bob's offer is the opposite of my initial offer, I'll try to get a better deal. I'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","In round 3, the money I gain is worth 10% less than in round 2, and Bob's gain is worth 15% less than in round 2. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

I'm trying to get a bit more than Bob's offer in round 2, but not too greedy. Let's see if he accepts!"
