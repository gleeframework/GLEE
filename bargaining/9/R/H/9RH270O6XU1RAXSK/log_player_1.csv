Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to get closer to a fair split, but I'm willing to compromise a bit. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $5,000 is now worth 80% of $6,000, and Bob's gain of $5,000 is now worth 90% of $5,600.

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, as it seems like I'm giving up more value than I got in the first round. I'll reject this offer.
