Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was a bit skewed.  I'm willing to be more generous than that, but this offer reflects the fact that future rounds benefit me more than you. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
