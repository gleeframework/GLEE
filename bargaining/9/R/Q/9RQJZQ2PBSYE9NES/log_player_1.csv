```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take a smaller share, I'm willing to give you a better deal later 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

After considering Bob's offer, I decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 3000$ gain, especially considering the 20% inflation hit. I'm hoping for a better deal later on."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 40% of its original value due to the cumulative 20% inflation, I'll aim for a higher share. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a higher share to account for the inflation. Your turn!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting greedy, I'll give you a slightly higher share this time 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really biting now!

Considering the offer, I decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 4000$ gain, especially considering the significant inflation hit. I'm holding out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The game is heating up!

Since the money is worth a mere 25.6% of its original value due to the cumulative inflation, I'll aim for a higher share. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not getting any younger, Bob. I need a better deal now or I'll walk away!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're bluffing, I'll give you a lowball offer to see how serious you are 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","The stakes are getting desperate!

Considering the offer, I decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

A 1000$ gain is not even worth considering at this point, especially considering the massive inflation hit. I'm willing to take the risk and hope for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","It's getting dire!

Since the money is worth a mere 16.2% of its original value due to the cumulative inflation, I'll aim for a high-risk, high-reward strategy. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""I'm going all-in. Take it or leave it, Bob. I'm not getting any younger!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not serious about leaving, I'll take a small share to see if you really walk 
# Alice gain: 500 
# Bob gain: 9500 
Do you accept this offer?","The desperation is real!

Considering the offer, I decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

A 500$ gain is laughable at this point, especially considering the massive inflation hit. I'm willing to take the risk and hope that Bob will make a more serious offer in the next round. I'm not going to back down now!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","It's getting ridiculous!

Since the money is worth a mere 8.16% of its original value due to the cumulative inflation, I'll aim for a last-ditch effort. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not bluffing this time. Take the 1000$ and be done with it. I'm walking away!""
}
```"
