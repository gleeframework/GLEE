"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. Fair is fair! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nSince the offer is to split the money evenly, it is a fair and reasonable proposal. Considering the 10% inflation rate per round, accepting this offer ensures that I, Bob, receive $50, which is half of the original amount. Proceeding to the next round would risk losing value due to inflation, and there is no guarantee of a better offer. Therefore, accepting this offer is the best decision in this scenario."
