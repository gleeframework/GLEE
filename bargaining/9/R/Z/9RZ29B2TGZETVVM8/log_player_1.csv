"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not too concerned about the inflation affecting my gain. However, I'm not thrilled about Bob getting 60% of the money.

I'll decide to reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn to make a new proposal. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher percentage for myself this time. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection! Okay, let's analyze Bob's new offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not too concerned about the inflation affecting my gain. However, I notice that Bob's offer is similar to my previous offer, but with a slight adjustment in his favor.

I'll decide to accept this offer.
