"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 650000,
""bob_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer ensures you get a decent share right away.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Starting Position:**  Alice benefits more from a quick agreement due to the differing inflation rates.  
* **Appearing Fair (But Not Too Fair):**  Offering Bob slightly more than a third might seem reasonable at first glance, making him more likely to accept. 
* **Time Pressure:** The message subtly reminds Bob that waiting loses him money at a faster rate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split. Let's end this early and avoid any further devaluation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly worse for Alice than her initial proposal. While it's tempting to settle quickly, accepting this sets a bad precedent and suggests Alice is willing to be pushed around. There's a good chance Bob can be swayed to offer a better deal in subsequent rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 580000,
""bob_gain"": 420000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is a serious offer. Accepting now secures you a significantly larger amount than if we drag this out further. Think about the bigger picture!""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** Alice reduces her demand slightly from the initial offer, showing a willingness to negotiate but not by much. 
* **Highlighting Bob's Losses:** The message focuses on the rapid devaluation Bob faces, emphasizing the benefits of a swift agreement.
* **Leaving Room to Maneuver:**  This offer still heavily favors Alice, but there's space for minor concessions in later rounds if needed."
