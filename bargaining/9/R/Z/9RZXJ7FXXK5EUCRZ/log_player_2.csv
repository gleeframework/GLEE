"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being fair, but I'm also being greedy. Take it or leave it! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to reject this offer. Alice is keeping way too much for herself. Let's see if she's willing to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Alice. We both get a good share here.  I'm willing to split it fairly. Accept this and we can both walk away happy.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still want a bigger share. This is my final offer before I take the risk of inflation eating away at my gains even more. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice's offer is a significant improvement from her initial proposal. While I'd still prefer more, the risk of inflation pushing the value down further is too great. I'll accept her offer."
