"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money in a 3:2 ratio. This could be fair considering the risk of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

It's too early to accept a 3:2 split.  While inflation is a factor, there's still a good chance of getting a better deal later. Let's see what Alice offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Let's flip the script this round. I propose a 6:4 split in my favor.  It's a fair starting point, and we can negotiate further if you'd like.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I believe a 50-50 split is fair given the circumstances and our previous offers. Let's aim for equality this time. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice's offer is reasonable given the inflation and the previous rounds. It's a fair compromise, and accepting it avoids the risk of getting nothing at all in later rounds."
