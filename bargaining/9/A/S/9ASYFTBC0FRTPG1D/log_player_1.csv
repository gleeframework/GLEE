I'm going to start with a very lopsided offer.  I want to see if Bob is willing to be a bit more cooperative in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm going to try a more fair offer this time. I think a 50/50 split is the most logical way to divide the money."
