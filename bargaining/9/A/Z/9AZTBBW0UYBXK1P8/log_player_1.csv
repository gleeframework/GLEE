"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects the urgency for me to settle due to inflation.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair.  You get a lower share due to inflation, but we both get a decent amount. This avoids the risk of more losses in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer might seem ""fair"" on the surface, it significantly favors him in the long run. The inflation disparity means my losses are accelerating faster than his. Accepting this offer would lock me into a disadvantageous position. I need to push for a better split, even if it means risking another round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
