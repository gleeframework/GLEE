Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Time pressure is on you, Bob. Inflation hurts you more 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly playing on the time pressure and the impact of inflation on my potential gains. However, accepting this offer would mean losing a significant chunk of the money. While it's tempting to avoid walking away with nothing, holding out a bit longer might make Alice more open to a fairer split."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 510000,
""alice_gain"": 490000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. I'm offering you a very favorable split, especially considering the time constraint and the impact of inflation on me.  Let's be reasonable and end this.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing the pressure on Alice. By offering a slightly smaller amount than before, I'm emphasizing the diminishing returns due to inflation while still presenting her with a very good deal. The message is framed to make her reconsider her tough stance and understand the urgency of the situation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is killing your gains, Bob. I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is getting incredibly tight! Alice is really pressing her advantage. Let's analyze:

* **Time Pressure:** We only have 5 rounds left! 
* **Diminishing Returns:** Accepting this round means I get 440,000 which is considerably less than my starting point due to inflation. Waiting means it'll get even worse.
* **Alice's Strategy:** She's betting I'll crack under pressure. 

While the rational choice is likely to accept to avoid getting zero, I'm going to make one last risky play:

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:** This is a HUGE gamble. However, Alice might be overplaying her hand.  By rejecting, I'm signaling I'm willing to risk it all. There's a small chance this makes her reconsider a more balanced offer in the next round.  It's high risk, high reward."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is insane.  We're down to the wire. A 50/50 split is the ONLY fair option left. Take it or leave it â€“ we both lose otherwise.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the final push. By going for an even 50/50 split, I'm conveying:

* **Seriousness:**  No more games. It's a clear, equal division.
* **Urgency:**  I'm emphasizing the ""lose-lose"" scenario if we don't agree NOW.
* **Fairness:**  It removes the inflation argument, putting the decision squarely on her. 

If she rejects this, she's likely to offer something barely acceptable in the next round, or we both get nothing.  It's a risky, all-in play."
