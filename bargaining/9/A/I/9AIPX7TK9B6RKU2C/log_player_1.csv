I'm going to start with a very high offer for myself, hoping Bob will accept it in the first round. Let's see how this goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It's a fair offer, and I'm not sure how the inflation will affect future rounds. I'd rather take the guaranteed 50% than risk losing it all."
