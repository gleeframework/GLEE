"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 90/10, I think that's a fair deal for both of us.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
It's a bit early to accept such a lopsided offer. Let's see if we can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is more equitable. Let's be reasonable and make this quick.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but 60/40 is still too much in your favor.  Let's meet in the middle at 55/45.  It's a fair and reasonable offer.  
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I would still prefer a 60/40 split,  this is a significant improvement over the initial 90/10. Accepting this offer is the best option for securing a good amount of money considering the inflation."
