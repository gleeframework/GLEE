Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you wanting a little more, but this split seems more fair to me. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Since the money is now worth 5% less, I'd like to try and negotiate a better deal. Let's see what happens in the next round!"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet in the middle""}\n\nIn this round, I'm taking into account the 5% decrease in value due to inflation. I'm offering Bob $48 and taking $52 for myself, suggesting that we meet in the middle to account for the loss in value. Hopefully, Bob will find this offer more acceptable!"
