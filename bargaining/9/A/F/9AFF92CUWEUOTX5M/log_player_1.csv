"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fairer.  We can both still walk away with a great amount of money, and it's a more equitable starting point for negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Reason:While Bob's offer is closer to a typical 50/50 split, it still heavily favors him. I'm willing to negotiate, but not when I'm losing a significant amount of potential earnings. The longer Bob waits, the less valuable the money becomes for both of us."
