"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1} 
```

I'm going to take a very large portion for myself and offer Bob a tiny amount. I figure he'll likely reject it, but it's the best way to maximize my potential gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

This offer is equally unfair, and I will reject it. I'm hoping to secure a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000} 
```

I'm going to offer Bob a much more significant share this time. He's likely to accept, and while the inflation hits my share, it's still a good chunk of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While the inflation has hit me hard, this offer is still significantly better than what I'd receive if we keep rejecting each other.  It's time to take what I can get."
