"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the $10,000 with an 80/20 split in favor of Alice. This ensures a significant portion for both parties, considering the risk of inflation.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise and give you a decent share, but I think 80/20 is too generous. This 60/40 split is a fairer balance of power. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
