"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, Alice proposes that she receives $60 and Bob receives $40. She also includes a message suggesting that her proposal is fair, but slightly biased in her favor. Since this is the first round, the total value of the money is still $100 for both players. Bob will now decide whether to accept this offer or proceed to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fairer, given the inflation rate. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nIn this response, Alice decides to reject Bob's offer of a 55/45 split. Despite the inflation reducing the value of her potential gain, she chooses to proceed to the next round, presumably hoping for a better offer or planning to make a counteroffer that favors her more. The game will continue to the next round, where Alice will make a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I'm being generous""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, Alice proposes that she receives $58 and Bob receives $42. She also includes a message suggesting that she is being generous, considering the inflation that has reduced the value of her potential gain. Since this is the third round, the total value of the money is worth 10% less for Alice compared to the first round, but remains the same for Bob. Bob will now decide whether to accept this offer or proceed to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time. I think we both need to compromise to make this work. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nIn this response, Alice decides to accept Bob's offer of an even 50/50 split. Given the increasing impact of inflation on her potential gain, she chooses to accept the offer, likely realizing that further rounds would only decrease the value of her share. The game ends with Alice and Bob agreeing to split the $100 evenly."
