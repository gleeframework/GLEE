Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you value fairness Alice, but I'm taking a bigger risk with inflation.  This offer ensures I'm covered while still leaving you with a sizable sum. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000

""alice_gain"": 480000,

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the time pressure you're under. This offer is a compromise, acknowledging the decreasing value while still providing you a significant amount. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob acknowledges the time pressure, his offer is still heavily skewed in his favor. The decreasing value of the money for me means I need to prioritize reaching a deal soon, but not at the cost of accepting a bad deal.  I need to signal I'm willing to walk away if necessary."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is my final offer. It's clear you're aiming for a larger share, but this is the best I can do considering the time pressure. If we don't agree now, we both lose out.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency:**  The message emphasizes the urgency of the situation. By stating it's my final offer, I increase the perceived cost of Bob rejecting it.
* **Concession:** I'm slightly increasing my offer from round 3 to signal some flexibility and willingness to compromise. 
* **Framing:** I'm framing the offer as a loss for both of us if rejected, appealing to Bob's rational side. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between getting a reasonable deal and avoiding reaching the point where the inflation makes even a reasonable offer unattractive."
