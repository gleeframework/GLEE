Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, let's try this.  How about a 55/45 split in my favor?  It's a bit closer to the middle ground, and we're losing money with each round due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
