Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I'd like to propose a more even split.  Let's try 60/40 with me getting the larger share this time.  It's a small difference, but I think it's fair considering we both have the opportunity to make counter-offers. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
