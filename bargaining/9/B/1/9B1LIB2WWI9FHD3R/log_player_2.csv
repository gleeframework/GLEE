"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I propose a 60/40 split,  with me taking the larger share. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see if we can do better!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, but I think a 60/40 split in my favor is more fair, considering the inflation will impact you more significantly than me.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I understand your perspective. Let's try a 48/52 split. This acknowledges the inflation but still offers a relatively fair distribution. 
# Bob gain: 5200 
# Alice gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
This offer is slightly better for me, and considering inflation, it's a good deal."
