"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a more equitable split, with me taking 5500 and you taking 4500. This ensures a fairer share while still considering potential inflation, and hopefully we can reach an agreement quickly. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{
