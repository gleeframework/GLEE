"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60-40""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly this time. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer...

Since the money is worth 20% less, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gets $50 (initially $62.50, but 20% less due to inflation)
* Bob gets $50 (initially $50, but still 20% less due to inflation)

I think this offer is reasonable, considering the reduced value of the money. I'll accept Bob's offer.
