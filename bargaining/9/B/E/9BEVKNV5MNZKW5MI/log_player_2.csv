Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 43

**Reasoning:**

It's getting down to the wire. While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer results in a gain that is still better than future rounds where inflation will further erode my share.  Alice knows I'm feeling the pressure, and it's unlikely she'll offer anything better in a potential Round 6."
