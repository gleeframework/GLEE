"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
```

I'm going for a generous, but not reckless, first offer.  It's important to secure a good chunk of the money early on, but I'm also hoping Bob will see the fairness of my offer and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is a complete reversal of my initial offer. While the inflation rate on his side is lower, it's still in his best interest to accept my first offer.  I'll reject this and try to negotiate a fairer split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7200, ""bob_gain"": 2800} 
```

I'm adjusting my offer to account for the inflation, but still aiming for a majority share.  My offer is still fair, and I believe Bob will see that if he wants to avoid losing even more money to inflation in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly worse, but it's clear he's not going to budge on his desire for a large majority share.  I'm going to stick to my guns and try to negotiate a fairer split in the next round.  The inflation is hitting me harder, but I'm not willing to give up almost 80% of the money just yet."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
```

I'm reducing my share again, but still holding out for a significant portion of the money. The inflation is really starting to bite now, but I need to make sure I get something out of this. If Bob rejects this, he's going to be getting a much smaller slice of the pie in the coming rounds."
