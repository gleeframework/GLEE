"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you a decent amount to start with, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent amount, but I think I deserve more since I'm the one making the proposal this round 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money has decreased, and Bob is trying to take advantage of that.

I'll reject his offer for now. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You think you deserve more just because you're making the proposal this round? I'm not convinced. I want a better deal.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a better offer this time. Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll aim for a more even split. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle this round. I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving away too much.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet in the middle, but I think we can do better than this. I'm making a slightly more aggressive offer this round 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money has decreased significantly for me, but Bob's offer seems more reasonable this time. I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, Bob. I think we've reached a good compromise. I'll accept your offer.""
