"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take 999999 and give you a dollar. It's a fair deal, right? 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
It's a very unfair deal, and even though the amount is small, it's better to reject and see what Alice offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly. I get 60%, you get 40%. It's a good deal for both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time.  It's the fairest way, and we both get a decent amount. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While it's not ideal, accepting this offer is the best option.  Even with inflation, $500,000 is a significant amount, and we have no guarantee that Alice will offer anything better in the future."
