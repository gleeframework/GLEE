"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fair, considering the risk of inflation.  Let's split it 60/40 in my favor. If you reject this, we'll be at the mercy of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
