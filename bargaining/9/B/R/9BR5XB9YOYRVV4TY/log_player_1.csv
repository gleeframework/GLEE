Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I propose to keep 900,000 dollars for myself and give Bob 100,000 dollars.  I believe this is a fair offer, given that I'm the one taking the risk of inflation in the future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 720000, ""bob_gain"": 280000} 
```

I propose to keep 720,000 dollars for myself and give Bob 280,000 dollars.  This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, but it still accounts for the inflation that has occurred."
