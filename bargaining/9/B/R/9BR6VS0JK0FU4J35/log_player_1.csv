"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle to start. Accept and we can call it a day!""
}

This way, we both get an equal share, and we can end the game if Bob likes it."

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less now, I'll have to be more cautious. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.
