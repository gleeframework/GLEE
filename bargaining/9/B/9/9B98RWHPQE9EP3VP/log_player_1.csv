"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can move on to the next round.""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob a relatively small amount, but it's a fair starting point, and I'm hoping he'll accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous in round 1. I'll take a larger share this time. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take advantage of me!

I'll reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give up 70% of the total amount. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""You were too greedy last time. I'll give you a fair share this time. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share than I could have, but it's a fair split. Let's see if he'll accept it this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you in the middle this time. It's a fair split. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to find a middle ground!

I'll accept this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

A 50-50 split seems like a fair and reasonable compromise, and I'm willing to end the game here."
