Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5250, ""alice_gain"": 4750, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Alice. How about a 52.5/47.5 split?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm giving you one last chance. 57-43 is my last proposal. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```
At this point, accepting is the most logical choice for Bob. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  The longer the game goes on, the less Bob's share is actually worth due to inflation. Accepting a 4300 offer now is better than risking an even worse deal in later rounds.

* **Alice's Stance:**  Alice has consistently offered proposals where she receives the majority. Her latest message suggests she's unlikely to budge further.

* **No Guarantee of a Better Deal:**  Bob has no guarantee that if he rejects this offer, he can propose a deal in the next round that Alice will accept. 

Waiting any longer is too risky for Bob, given the decreasing value of the money.
