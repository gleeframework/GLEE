"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a small difference, we can always negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $90 and Bob gets $10. I'm hoping Bob will see the small difference and be willing to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle and start fresh. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to be more careful with my decisions.

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a reasonable proposal, and meeting in the middle seems like a good starting point. I'm willing to accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
