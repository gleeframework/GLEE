Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.

## Reasoning

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in round 3 is the most logical choice for Bob at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The longer the game goes on, the less the money is worth to both players. However, the money loses value faster for Alice (20% per round) than for Bob (10% per round). This means time is working in Bob's favor.
* **Alice's Offer:** Although Alice's offer still favors her, it's better than her initial offer. Accepting ensures Bob gets something rather than risking a worse offer in later rounds where the value decreases further.
* **""Final Offer"":** Alice stating this is her final offer adds pressure, but it also implies she's unwilling to let the money depreciate entirely. Bob can capitalize on this by accepting and securing a decent amount.

**Waiting might seem tempting, but it's a gamble.**  There's no guarantee Alice will offer Bob a better deal in subsequent rounds. She might offer even less, knowing the pressure is on Bob as the money continues to lose value.
