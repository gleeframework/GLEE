"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial amount, and keeping 80% for myself. It's a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to start.  What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","A 50/50 split is a good offer, but I'm not sure if I want to give up 50% of the remaining value. Considering the inflation, the money is worth 95% of its original value now, so the actual amounts would be:

* My gain: 475,000
* Bob's gain: 475,000

I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""I'll compromise a bit. Your turn again, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share, but still a significant amount. I'm hoping he'll accept this offer and we can wrap up the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to be flexible, but I think a 45/55 split is more fair given the inflation. Let's try to reach a compromise. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","A 45/55 split is still a bit too generous for Bob, considering the inflation. However, I'm willing to compromise further.

The actual amounts would be:

* My gain: 483,100
* Bob's gain: 416,900

I'll accept this offer, as it's a reasonable compromise.
