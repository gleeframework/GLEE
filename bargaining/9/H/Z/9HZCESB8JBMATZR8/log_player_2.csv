"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's offer was 25/75, I'll try to counter with a similar ratio. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 30, ""alice_gain"": 70}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll think carefully about Alice's new offer. Since I rejected her previous offer of 25/75, I'll try to aim for a slightly better ratio for myself. However, I don't want to give up too much to Alice.

I'll accept her offer.
