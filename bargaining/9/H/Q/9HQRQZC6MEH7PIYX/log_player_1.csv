"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split in my favor is more fair, considering I get to propose first in this round. Let's see if we can agree on that. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks he deserves a 60/40 split in his favor, huh? That's a pretty bold move!

After considering his proposal, I've decided to reject it. I don't think a 60/40 split is fair, especially since I was willing to offer him 40% in the first round.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to give you 60% of the money. Let's try again!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still think 55/45 is a fair split.""
}
```

I've adjusted the split to 55/45 in my favor, but I'm still willing to give Bob a decent share. Let's see if he'll accept this offer!"
