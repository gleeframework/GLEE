"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'm willing to compromise.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40, which is 40% of the original $100. This way, I'll get $60, which is 60% of the original $100. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game here!"
