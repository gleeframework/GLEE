"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my opening offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

This is a fair split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth less than before, but I'm not sure if Bob's gain is worth more or less. I'll have to be careful.

I'll reject this offer for now, hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, my gain is worth 5% less than in the previous round, so I'll aim for a slightly higher share to compensate. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain! Considering the significant drop in value, I'll have to be more aggressive in my next offer. But for now, I'll reject Bob's offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","With the inflation taking a bigger bite out of my potential gain, I'll aim for a higher share to make up for it. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}"
