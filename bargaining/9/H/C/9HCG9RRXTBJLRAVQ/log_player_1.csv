"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, 7:3 ratio. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 7:3 split in my favor, which is a relatively fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be a bit more equitable this time. I think a 60/40 split is fair, considering the inflation we need to account for. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual amount I would gain in this round is 40 * 0.8 = 32, and Bob would gain 60 * 0.8 = 48.

I'm not thrilled about the 60:40 split, but I'll consider it. I'd rather not proceed to the next round if I can get a better deal. 

I accept this offer.
