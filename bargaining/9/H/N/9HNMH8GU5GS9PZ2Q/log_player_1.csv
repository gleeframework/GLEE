"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

This offer reflects my understanding of the game. While I want to maximize my gain, I recognize that Bob needs to have some incentive to accept the offer. A small amount for him might be enough to make him agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer to get more, accepting this offer ensures I get something.  The next round would likely be worse for me due to inflation."
