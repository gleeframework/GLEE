"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Even though a 100,000$ offer seems appealing, it's worth taking a chance and seeing what Alice offers next.  There's a chance she might be willing to split the money more evenly, and with each round the value of the money decreases, so waiting might be beneficial."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While it's still less than I initially wanted, considering the inflation and the fact that Alice is becoming more generous,  accepting this offer seems like the best option. It's a decent sum, and continuing to negotiate might lead to a worse outcome."
