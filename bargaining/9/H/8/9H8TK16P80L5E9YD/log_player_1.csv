"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that we divide the $1,000,000 equally, with each of us getting $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40% and keep 60%, it's a good starting point 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth 20% less, I'll have to think carefully about this.

I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in Round 3.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good compromise""}

I'm proposing that I get $600,000 and Bob gets $400,000. I'm trying to find a balance between fairness and getting a slightly better deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 48% and keep 52%, a slight adjustment from my previous offer 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the continued erosion of the value of the money, but I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

I'll accept this offer, hoping that we can find a better solution in future rounds.
