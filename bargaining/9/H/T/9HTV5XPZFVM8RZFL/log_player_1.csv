I'm going to start with a pretty aggressive offer. I want to maximize my share in the first round, hoping Bob might accept it.  Let's see what happens!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even with the inflation, Bob's offer is way too low. I'm going to reject and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a slightly lower share than my first offer. I'm hoping that after his last offer and the effect of inflation, he might find this more appealing."
