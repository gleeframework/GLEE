"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}

I'm offering a 50/50 split, which seems fair to start."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this new offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with Bob getting a larger share, especially considering the money is worth less to me due to inflation. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my new proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}

I'm offering a slightly higher share for myself, but still leaving a decent amount for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really biting! Considering the money is worth less and less, I'll have to be more careful with my decisions.

{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}

I'll accept Bob's offer from round 4. At this point, I'm not sure I can do any better, and the money is worth so much less."
