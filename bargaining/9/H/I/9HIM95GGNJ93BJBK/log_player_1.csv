"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This offer gives me 55% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob gets 45%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll think carefully about this one. 

I'll reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With inflation taking a toll, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}
```"
