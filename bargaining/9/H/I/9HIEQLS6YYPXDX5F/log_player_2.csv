"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a simple split - 60/40.  It's important to get something settled before inflation eats away at the value. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. With 10% inflation, the money will be worth less in the next round, but I believe I can get a better deal than 40% of the original amount. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that's slightly more in Alice's favor than a 50/50 split, but still better for me than the original offer. I'll also mention the inflation to add some urgency to the decision.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the 10% inflation, let's aim for a more balanced split. This way, we both get a decent share before the value drops further.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out and we both lose if we can't agree.  I'll come down a little, but this is a fair deal considering the time pressure. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlthough the offer is slightly better than the original one, I still think I can negotiate a more favorable split. With 19% inflation, the value of the money has decreased, but I'm willing to take the risk to try and get a better deal in the next round. Let's proceed!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Since the value of the money has decreased by 19% due to inflation, I'll take that into account and try to find a mutually beneficial split. I'll make an offer that's slightly more in Alice's favor than the previous one, but still better for me than the last offer I received.

{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Considering the decreasing value of the money, let's meet in the middle and find a compromise. This split should be more acceptable to both of us, given the time pressure and inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm meeting you in the middle.  Let's end this before we both lose out. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant decrease in value due to inflation (34.39% less than the original amount), I think this offer is reasonable. Meeting in the middle is a fair compromise, and I don't want to risk further devaluation of the money. Let's accept this offer and end the game!"
