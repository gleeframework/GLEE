Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's share fairly""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $400,000 and keep $600,000 for myself, with a message suggesting a fair share. Since the value of money decreases by 10% for Bob in each round, I'm hoping he'll accept this offer rather than risking a lower value in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, let's close this deal now. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer because I think I can get a better deal in the next round. Since the money is worth 10% less for Bob in each round, he may be more willing to compromise to avoid losing even more value. I'm willing to take the risk to try to get a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll offer Bob $420,000 and keep $580,000 for myself. Given that the money is worth 10% less for Bob in each round, I'll mention this in my message to emphasize the benefit of accepting the offer now rather than waiting for the next round.\n{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this might be the best deal you'll get""}\n\nI'm trying to persuade Bob to accept this offer by highlighting the impact of inflation on his potential gain. Since the value of the money decreases for him with each round, I'm hoping he'll find this offer more appealing than the risk of losing even more value in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer.  Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll accept this offer because Bob's message suggests that this is his final offer, and I don't want to risk him walking away from the deal. Additionally, considering the inflation, Bob's gain is already worth 27.1% less than in the first round, so he may not be willing to compromise further. I think this is the best deal I can get at this point.\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nBy accepting this offer, I'll receive $480,000, which is a decent amount considering the negotiations. I'm choosing to end the game here rather than risking further negotiations that may not result in a better outcome for me."
