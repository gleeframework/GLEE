"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable""}\n\n###\n\nI'll offer Bob 40% of the money and keep 60% for myself. This is a reasonable offer considering the inflation rates. If Bob accepts, I'll get $600,000, and he'll get $400,000. If he declines, the money will be worth less in the next round, but I'll try to negotiate a better deal.\n\n###\n\nYour turn! Please respond with Bob's decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm aiming for a more balanced split. This offer ensures you get a significant sum before inflation diminishes it further. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Although the money is worth less due to inflation, I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the next round. With a 20% decrease in value for me and only a 5% decrease for Bob, I want to try to get a larger share before accepting.\n\n###\n\nLet's proceed to the next round! Please respond with my next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 525000, ""bob_gain"": 475000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, this is a more balanced offer.""}\n\n###\n\nI'll offer Bob 47.5% of the money and keep 52.5% for myself. Given the inflation rates, I believe this is a more balanced offer. If Bob accepts, I'll get $525,000, and he'll get $475,000. If he declines, the money will be worth even less in the next round, but I'll try to negotiate again.\n\n###\n\nYour turn! Please respond with Bob's decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be realistic, Alice. This is a fair offer given the rapid inflation impacting your share. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI'll accept Bob's offer. Considering the significant decrease in value for my share (48.8% less than the original amount) and the relatively smaller decrease for Bob's share (14.26% less), I believe this offer is reasonable. If I reject and we proceed to the next round, the inflation will further diminish my potential gain, making this offer more appealing.\n\n###\n\nLet's conclude the game! I accept Bob's offer of $475,000 for myself and $525,000 for him."
