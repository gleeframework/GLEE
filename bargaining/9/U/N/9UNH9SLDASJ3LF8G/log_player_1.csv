"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, giving Bob a significant share of the initial $10,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can avoid a long and potentially contentious negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth 10% less, so the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 4500
* Bob gain: 4500

I'll accept Bob's offer.
