"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is a fair offer, Bob. You get a small share, but I am willing to give you a chance to accept and avoid risking the value of your share in future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 10% less for me with each passing round, I'd like to try to get a better deal before the value of the money decreases further."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, Alice. Since the money is worth less with each round, let's divide it fairly and end the game.""}\n\n###\nI've decided to offer Alice a deal where I receive $450,000 and she receives $550,000. I've also included a message to Alice explaining that I'd like to meet in the middle and divide the money fairly, considering the decreasing value of the money with each round."
