"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 80-20""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $20, which is a relatively small amount, in the hopes that he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent share, but I want a bit more 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $60 is actually worth $48 (80% of 60). Bob's gain of $40 is still $40.

I'll reject this offer, since I think I can do better than a 48-40 split. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less again, my offer of $60 from round 2 is now worth $48. I'll make a new offer that's even more aggressive:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a bit less, but you'll have to do better than that""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, it's a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $50 is now worth $25 (48.8% of 50).

I'm not sure if this is a good deal, but I'm getting desperate to end the game. I'll accept the offer, hoping it's the best I can get.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
