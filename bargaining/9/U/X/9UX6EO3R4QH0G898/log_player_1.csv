Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The value is decreasing fast for me. I need a bigger share to make up for the loss. 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting increasingly desperate, but his offers are still not favorable.  We're getting closer to a point where he'll be forced to offer a larger share just to avoid walking away with nothing. I'm willing to push him a bit further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
