"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I'll have to think carefully. Since my gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 5% less, I'll have to adjust my expectations accordingly.

I'll reject this offer.

Round 3
