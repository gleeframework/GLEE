"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take the majority, but still leave some for you.""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets the remaining 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that. Let's be a little more equitable.  This way, we both get a decent chunk. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about giving up more than I initially proposed, and I'm not convinced that Bob is being entirely honest about his intentions. I'd like to make a counteroffer and see if we can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer:

I'm proposing that I get 52% of the remaining $100, which is $52, and Bob gets the remaining 48%, which is $48."
