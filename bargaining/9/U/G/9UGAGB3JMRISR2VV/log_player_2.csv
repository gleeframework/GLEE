Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Last chance, I won't go lower 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58

```

At this point, the value of waiting any longer is heavily outweighed by the inflation. Accepting a slightly less than ideal offer is better than risking an even worse outcome in the next round."
