"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

This way, I get 60% of the original $10,000, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I need to consider the relative values of the amounts I'll receive. In this case, I'll get $3000, which is worth 30% of the original $10,000, and Bob will get $7000, which is worth 70% of the original $10,000.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Bob's offer was quite generous to him, I'll try to make a more balanced offer this time. Here it is:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500}

This way, I get 45% of the original $10,000, and Bob gets 55%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting that Bob's offer is now a 50/50 split. Considering the effects of inflation, the actual values are:

My gain: $5000, worth 50% of the original $10,000, but adjusted for inflation, it's worth 50% of the original $10,000 / 1.0526 (1 + 0.0526 inflation factor) ≈ 47.5% of the original $10,000
Bob's gain: $5000, worth 50% of the original $10,000, but adjusted for inflation, it's worth 50% of the original $10,000 / 1.271 inflation factor ≈ 39.3% of the original $10,000

Considering the relative values, I think I'd be better off accepting this offer.
