I'm going to start with a pretty generous offer to Bob, hoping to end the game quickly.  Let's see if he's willing to take it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer to have a larger share, with inflation, the offer is still better than risking getting nothing in the future rounds."
