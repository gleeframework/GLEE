"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This is a relatively fair split, with me getting a slight edge. Let's see if Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth less. I'll think carefully...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer. I'm hoping for a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a higher share this time. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is sticking to his guns. Considering the inflation, my gain is worth significantly less now. I'll think carefully...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer. It's not the best deal I could have gotten, but it's better than going further into the game with diminishing returns."
