"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm offering a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, I'm not getting a great deal. I'll have to think carefully...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With the inflation effect, I'll have to be more aggressive in my offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}

I'm taking a risk by offering a 80/20 split, but I think it's worth it to try to get a better deal before the next round of inflation hits."
