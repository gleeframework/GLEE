"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a quick agreement and avoid any potential inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

While this is a better offer for Bob than his initial one, it's still a significant loss for me. I'm going to reject it and see if I can get a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20} 
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly to try and incentivize Bob to accept.  The inflation is starting to bite, and I need to secure a deal soon."
