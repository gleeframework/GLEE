"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll be eager to get something and accept my offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try again, I'm willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with the amount I'd get from this offer. I was hoping for a bit more. Let's see if Bob can do better in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 0% less for me and 40% less for Bob compared to the first round, I'll make a slightly more aggressive offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You're running out of time, Bob! Don't let it slip away!""
}
```

I'm trying to squeeze out a bit more for myself, while still giving Bob a decent share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, it's getting late 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to find a middle ground. I'll consider his offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm willing to accept a 50-50 split, especially since it's getting late and I don't want to risk getting less in future rounds."
