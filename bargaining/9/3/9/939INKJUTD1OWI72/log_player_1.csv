"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000 and keeping $9,000 for myself. This is a relatively small amount for me, so I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me! 

I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money is worth less each round, I'd like to get a bigger share this time. However, Bob's offer is a significant one, and I don't want to risk going into further rounds.

I'll decide to accept Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
