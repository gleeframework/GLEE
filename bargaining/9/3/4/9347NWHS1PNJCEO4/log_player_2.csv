Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give up some more, but I'm still not happy with a 55/45 split in your favor. How about 60/40? It's a good compromise considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting greedier!  The inflation is hurting me more each round, but I need to hold strong. Accepting a worse offer than Round 2 just encourages her to keep pushing for more.  I'm hoping she'll start to panic soon as the rounds run out."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 525000, ""alice_gain"": 475000, ""message"": ""Time is running out!  I'm offering a 52.5/47.5 split - this is my final concession.  We both need to agree or we'll both lose out!""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency:**  With only 6 rounds remaining, I need to signal the urgency of the situation.  A ""final offer"" tone can encourage Alice to accept. 
* **Slight Compromise:** I'm moving slightly closer to her previous offer (60/40) to show willingness to negotiate, but not by much. 
* **Emphasize Loss Aversion:**  Highlighting that we BOTH lose if we don't agree helps to shift her focus away from just maximizing her gains."
