"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $4,000 and keep $6,000. We can negotiate from here.""
}
```

This offer is a relatively fair split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can end the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair.  Let's work together to get the most out of this money. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think a 55/45 split is not favorable to me, and I'd like to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55/45 is still too skewed towards you. I'll offer 55/45 in my favor, but I'll give you a slightly better deal: $4,500 for me and $4,500 for you.""
}
```

I'm trying to get a better deal for myself, but I'm still willing to compromise and meet Bob halfway."
