I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. I'm confident that this is a fair offer, given that I'm taking the first turn."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

```

I'm offering a slightly more even split this time, acknowledging that Bob is now in a more advantageous position. However, I still believe this is a fair offer, given the diminishing value of the money."
