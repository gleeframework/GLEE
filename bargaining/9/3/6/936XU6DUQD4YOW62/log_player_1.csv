# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I understand you want more, Bob, but I'm not willing to accept a deal that's so lopsided. Let's compromise: I'll take slightly more this time, and we can keep the game going if you'd prefer.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a bigger share, since the money's value is dropping faster for me. Let's end this! 
# Alice gain: 43 
# Bob gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While the offer isn't ideal, the inflation rate is hitting Bob harder than me. It's better to accept this and secure a reasonable share before the value drops even further."
