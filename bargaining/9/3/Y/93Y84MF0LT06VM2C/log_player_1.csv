"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm still holding out for a bit more. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this new offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that Bob is willing to compromise, and I'd like to see if I can get a better deal. I'll reject this offer and see what Bob proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give away too much. Meet me in the middle?""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a good deal and not giving away too much. I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but still trying to keep some leverage for future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give away too much. I'll meet you halfway between my previous offer and yours. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to find a compromise. Considering the decreasing value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer, as it seems like a reasonable compromise, and I don't want to risk losing more value with each passing round."
