"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a small share for now. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering you 20% of the money, which is a relatively small share, but I'm leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started with a high offer, I'll try to get a better deal now 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less for me now, I'll have to be more cautious. Considering Bob's offer, I'll:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 60% share for myself, especially since the money is worth less than before. I'll try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me again, I'll try to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my next proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give away the majority. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly higher share to Bob, but still keeping a bit more for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: It's time to meet in the middle, but I'm not giving up on getting more 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth even less now, I'm getting more cautious. However, Bob's offer to meet in the middle seems reasonable, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with even less value. I'll:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept the 50-50 split, hoping that it's a fair deal considering the current value of the money."
