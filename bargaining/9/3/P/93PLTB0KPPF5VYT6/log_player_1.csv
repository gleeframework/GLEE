"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 20% and take 80%. You can try to do better next round.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and taking $8,000. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer. You can try to do better next round. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 10% less, so I need to make a decision based on a slightly smaller amount.

I'll reject this offer. My current offer was 80% of $10,000, which is $8,000. This offer is 75% of the original $10,000, which is $7,500. I'd like to do better than that.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my gain is worth 10% less than in the previous round, so I'll aim for a slightly better offer.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but not too much. You can try to do better next round.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $3,000 and taking $7,000. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not giving up yet. You can try to do better next round. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is catching up with me! With the money worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I need to adjust my thinking.

Let's calculate the equivalent value of my previous offer in the first round, which was $8,000. With 27.1% inflation, that's equivalent to $5,819.70 in today's value.

This new offer from Bob is $5,500, which is a bit more than the equivalent value of my previous offer. I'll accept this offer.
