"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is a fairly generous offer, considering I'm proposing to keep the majority of the money, but I'm willing to give Bob a decent chunk to get us started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to be more cautious. Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, which is a more even split than my initial offer. I'll accept this offer to get a decent share of the money.
