"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money evenly. This way, we both get a fair share. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's tempting to take the even split, but I'm Bob and I know the money is worth more to me than it is to Alice in the next round. I'll try to get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm sure you understand that I'm in a better position now. I'm offering you a fair share, considering the changing value of the money.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I believe fairness should be our guiding principle. Let's split the money equally, ensuring neither of us feels disadvantaged by the changing value of money. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

Alice's offer is fair, considering the changing value of the money. Taking the even split guarantees me a good sum, and it's likely the best deal I can get."
