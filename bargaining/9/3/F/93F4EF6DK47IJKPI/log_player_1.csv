"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take the majority, but you'll still get a decent share""}

I'm proposing that I get 70 dollars and Bob gets 30 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a smaller share, but I think 80 is a fairer split than 30 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think 20 is a fair share for me, considering I'm the one making the proposal in the next round. I'll try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
