"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need for haggling.""
}
```

This way, we both get $5,000 each, and we can end the game if Bob accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit less, but I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my $4000 is now worth less than $5000, but still a good chunk of the original $10,000. Bob's $6000 is worth even less due to the 20% inflation, but he's still getting a larger share.

I'll reject this offer for now. I'd like to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher share to compensate for the decreasing value of money. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit less, but I think this is a fair compromise.""
}
```

This way, I'm getting a slightly larger share, but still leaving room for Bob to negotiate if he wants a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still willing to give you a bit more, but I think I've been generous enough. 
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking its toll! Considering the significant decrease in the value of money, I'll need to be cautious. However, Bob's offer is still a bit more generous than my previous offer, and it's getting harder to get a better deal.

I'll accept this offer, as the value of $5800 is still significant, and I don't want to risk getting a worse deal in the next round.
