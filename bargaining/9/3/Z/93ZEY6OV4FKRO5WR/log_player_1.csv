"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, seems fair to me!""
}
```

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 60-40, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet you in the middle, let's see if you like it! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth less, but I'm still a good negotiator.

I'll think for a moment... Meeting in the middle is a reasonable proposal, but I'm not sure if it's the best deal I can get.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a stronger offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You can have a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair deal!""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly more skewed deal, with me getting $5,500 and Bob getting $4,500. Let's see if he'll accept this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting a smaller share, but I think you'll like the difference! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is biting! The money is worth less and less with each round.

But I'll think carefully about Bob's new offer... Getting $4,000 is less than my previous offer, but it's still a decent amount. And Bob is getting a bigger share, which might be a sign that he's willing to compromise.

I'll accept Bob's offer, even though it's not my ideal deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
