I'm going for a very aggressive first offer. Since we have 12 rounds, I want to secure as much of the money as possible early on.  I'm willing to leave Bob with a small amount hoping he'll accept in the hopes of getting something rather than nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a better deal, the inflation is a serious risk.  I'm getting a much smaller share than my initial offer, but it's still something.  It's better to take the secure 1000 now than risk getting nothing in the following rounds."
