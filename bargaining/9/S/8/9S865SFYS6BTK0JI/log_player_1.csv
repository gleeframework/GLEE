"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}

This is a fair and equal split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it to avoid going to the next round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'm not too concerned about the inflation effect. However, Bob is trying to take a larger share, which could be a sign that he's trying to get more in future rounds.

For now, I'll decide to:

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer in Round 2 was 60, I'm going to try to take a larger share to compensate for the potential inflation. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}

This way, I'm trying to get a slightly larger share to make up for the inflation, while still leaving Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is getting worse! Since the money Bob gains is worth significantly less than in the first round, I'm going to try to take advantage of this and negotiate a better deal. However, Bob's offer is still relatively close to the initial equal split, and I don't want to give up too much.

For now, I'll decide to:

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","The inflation is getting worse, but I'm still trying to get a fair deal. Since Bob's offer in Round 4 was 52, I'm going to try to take an even larger share to compensate for the inflation. Here's my proposal for Round 5:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}

This way, I'm trying to get a larger share to make up for the loss in value of the money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on Bob's offer! Since the money Bob gains is now worth a significant amount less than in the first round, I'm going to take a closer look at his offer. With the money I gain still being worth the same as in the first round, I'm in a relatively good position.

However, I'm not sure if Bob's offer is the best I can get, considering the extreme inflation. I'll decide to:

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","The inflation is really getting out of control! Since Bob's offer in Round 6 was 58, and the money he gains is worth significantly less than in the first round, I'm going to try to take an even larger share. Here's my proposal for Round 7:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 65,
  ""bob_gain"": 35
}

This way, I'm trying to get a larger share to make up for the extreme inflation, but I'm still leaving Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 36 
# Bob gain: 64 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a huge toll on Bob's offer! Since the money Bob gains is now worth an extremely small fraction of its original value, I'm going to take a closer look at his offer. With the money I gain still being worth the same as in the first round, I'm in a relatively good position.

Considering Bob's offer is still not as favorable to him as it was in earlier rounds, I'll decide to:

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","The inflation is almost catastrophic for Bob's offer! Since Bob's offer in Round 8 was 64, and the money he gains is worth an extremely small fraction of its original value, I'm going to try to take a huge share. Here's my proposal for Round 9:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}

This way, I'm trying to maximize my gain while leaving Bob with a tiny fraction of the original amount, considering the extreme inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 86.58% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 28 
# Bob gain: 72 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is almost crippling for Bob's offer! Since the money Bob gains is now worth an incredibly small fraction of its original value, I'm going to take a closer look at his offer. With the money I gain still being worth the same as in the first round, I'm in a strong position.

Considering Bob's offer is still relatively close to the original 50/50 split, and the value of his gain is extremely low, I'll decide to:

{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}

I'm willing to accept this offer, as the value of the money I gain is still significant, and I'm not sure if I can get a better deal in the next rounds."
