"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""bob_gain"": 6000
}
```

This way, Bob gets a larger share, and I'm hoping he'll accept and we can split the money quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already biting!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, $3000 is equivalent to $2400 in the first round's value. Bob's offer is still quite generous, but I'm not sure if I want to give up that much.

I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a new proposal, taking into account the ongoing inflation. Since the money is worth 40% less than in the first round, I'll aim for a more balanced split. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3500,
  ""bob_gain"": 6500
}
```

This way, I'm still giving Bob a significant share, but I'm also trying to protect my own interests in the face of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth 48.8% less, $2500 is equivalent to $2600 in the first round's value. Bob's offer is still quite generous, but I'm not sure if I want to give up that much.

I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a new proposal, taking into account the ongoing inflation. Since the money is worth 61.2% less than in the first round, I'll aim for a more aggressive split. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3200,
  ""bob_gain"": 6800
}
```

This way, I'm trying to get a slightly larger share, but I'm still leaving Bob with a decent amount to make the deal worthwhile."
