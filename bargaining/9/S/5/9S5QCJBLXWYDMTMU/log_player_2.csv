Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate, but I need to hold firm. Accepting a 25/75 split, even with inflation working against her, would be a bad move. There's still time to negotiate a better deal."

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, you drive a hard bargain. This is my final offer. Let's end this now and both walk away with something substantial. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** 

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer of a 40/60 split is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  With each round, the value of the money decreases significantly for Alice. This gives me leverage as the rounds progress. However, it also means the longer this drags on, the less appealing her offers might become, even if they seem to favor her nominally.
* **Time Pressure:**  We are past the halfway point, and only five rounds remain. Waiting any longer significantly increases the risk of walking away with nothing.
* **A Reasonable Offer:**  A 40/60 split isn't perfect, but it's a far better outcome than the earlier offers. It reflects the time pressure and inflation factors now at play.

Accepting now secures a reasonable amount, rather than risking a worse outcome by pushing our luck further."
