"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\n###\nI'm offering a 55-45 split in my favor, hoping Bob will see it as a reasonable starting point and accept, considering the looming threat of inflation impacting his potential earnings more significantly with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe in fairness too, how about this? 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, despite his claim of believing in fairness, his proposal is simply a reversal of my initial offer, favoring him instead. Given that the money's value remains unchanged for me but decreases for him with each round, I see no incentive to accept a deal that doesn't account for this dynamic. I'll proceed, anticipating that future rounds might bring a more favorable or genuinely fair offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is more than fair""}\n\n###\nGiven that the money's value decreases by 10% for Bob with each round but remains constant for me, I'm adjusting my offer to reflect this dynamic. By slightly increasing my share, I'm factoring in the inflationary pressure on Bob's potential earnings, aiming to incentivize him to accept a deal that accounts for the diminishing value of his share over time. This adjustment still offers Bob a substantial amount but recognizes the time-sensitive nature of our negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The inflation is hitting us both, let's be reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, despite his acknowledgment of inflation, his proposal doesn't adequately reflect the disproportionate impact of inflation on his earnings versus mine. His offer improves slightly from his previous one but still doesn't account for the nearly 30% decrease in value he's facing. Given this, I believe I can negotiate a better deal in subsequent rounds, especially as the pressure of inflation continues to mount on Bob's potential earnings."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Time is money, literally""}\n\n###\nAs the rounds progress and inflation continues to devalue Bob's potential earnings, I'm adjusting my offer to reflect the increasing urgency for him to accept a deal. By offering him $4000, I'm still providing a substantial sum, but I'm also acknowledging that with each passing round, the real value of his potential gain decreases. My message, ""Time is money, literally,"" underscores the impact of inflation and the importance of reaching an agreement sooner rather than later. This approach aims to strike a balance between maximizing my gain and providing Bob with a compelling reason to accept, given the circumstances."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the only fair option considering the circumstances. Let's be done with this. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer of a 50/50 split. While Bob frames this as his final offer and appeals to fairness, it overlooks the significant impact of inflation on his earnings. At this point, Bob's $5000 is worth nearly 41% less than it was initially, making his half of the split considerably less valuable than mine. Given the steady decrease in value for Bob and the unchanged value for me, I believe holding out for a better deal in subsequent rounds remains a viable strategy. Bob's assertion that this is his final offer may be a negotiation tactic, and I'm willing to test that by proceeding to the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 6200, ""bob_gain"": 3800, ""message"": ""Inflation waits for no one""}\n\n###\nConsidering Bob's last offer was framed as his final one but didn't account for the significant devaluation of his share due to inflation, I'm making a slightly more aggressive offer this round. By increasing my share to $6200, I'm applying pressure while still leaving a substantial amount for Bob. The message, ""Inflation waits for no one,"" serves as a reminder of the ongoing devaluation of the money for Bob, emphasizing the urgency of accepting a deal sooner rather than later. This approach aims to push Bob towards a decision, leveraging the time-sensitive nature of our negotiations."
