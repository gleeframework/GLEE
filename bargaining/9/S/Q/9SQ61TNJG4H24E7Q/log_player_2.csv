Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, this is more than fair 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Time is money, literally 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation working against me. While the gap is closing, I still have some leverage. Accepting $4,000 now is significantly less than what I could have gotten in the first round. I need to show Alice I'm serious about getting a fairer deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""This is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the only fair option considering the circumstances. Let's be done with this.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to play hardball.  Alice is clearly not budging much from her advantageous position.  By offering a 50/50 split, I'm calling her bluff.  It's the fairest offer possible, and by framing it as my ""final offer"" I'm increasing the pressure.  She needs to realize that her stubbornness will cost her if we don't reach an agreement soon."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation waits for no one 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a tough one. Alice is being incredibly stubborn, and my bargaining position weakens with each round.  Let's analyze:

* **Current Offer:** $3,800 is a significant loss compared to the initial rounds.
* **Rounds Remaining:**  We have 5 rounds left.  If I reject, there's a real chance I'll be squeezed into an even worse deal later. 
* **Alice's Behavior:** She seems content to let the clock run down, knowing time is on her side.

While accepting this offer stings, it might be the least worst option at this point. 

{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**  Continuing to play chicken with Alice is very risky.  There's a high chance she won't budge much, and I'll be forced to accept even less later. Taking the $3,800 now avoids the risk of walking away with nothing."
