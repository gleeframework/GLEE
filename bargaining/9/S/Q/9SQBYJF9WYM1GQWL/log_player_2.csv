Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm being generous! 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is correct that the value is decreasing, but she's using that to pressure me. I need to hold out for a better deal. While the difference seems small, it adds up over time, and I'm aiming for a larger share than what she's offering."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Okay, let's stop wasting time. 50/50 is the fairest and most efficient solution here.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

The longer this goes on, the less I get even if I win. A 50/50 split is fair and avoids the risk of getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your 50/50 is not as fair as it seems, considering inflation! 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is using manipulative tactics, trying to frame my 50/50 offer as unfair due to inflation, which only impacts me. This shows she's willing to exploit the situation to her advantage. Holding out for a better offer is still the best strategy, even with the increasing inflation. I need to make it clear that her tactics won't work."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 48,
""alice_gain"": 52,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic.  I'm not accepting a deal where I lose significantly more value than you. This offer is a compromise.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** We are past the halfway point, and the pressure is on. 
* **Shifting Strategy:** Alice is unlikely to accept a 50/50 split considering her previous rejections and her awareness of the inflation impacting me.  I need to make a concession to reach a deal.
* **Maintaining a Bottom Line:** Offering 48/52 is a compromise, but it still secures me a reasonable portion of the money while acknowledging the impact of inflation. 
* **Direct Communication:**  Calling out Alice's tactics directly might make her reconsider her approach and encourage a more reasonable negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, and value. I'm being kind. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** 

The situation has become critical. While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice given the circumstances:

* **Severely Diminishing Returns:**  The impact of inflation is becoming drastic. Waiting any longer will result in an even smaller share, even if I manage to get a slightly better deal in the next round or two.
* **Alice's Stubbornness:**  Alice has consistently demonstrated a willingness to drag this out and exploit the inflation working against me. It's unlikely she'll offer anything significantly better at this point.
* **Something is Better Than Nothing:** Holding out for a slightly larger share carries the very real risk of ending up with nothing if we run out of rounds.

While not a victory, accepting 45% now is a better outcome than risking a total loss."
