I want to see what Alice will offer in the next round.  The inflation is already hurting her more than me, so I have room to negotiate."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll meet you halfway on the advantage, considering the inflation 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Alice's offer is a bit better than my last one, and the inflation is really starting to bite. I'll take it."
