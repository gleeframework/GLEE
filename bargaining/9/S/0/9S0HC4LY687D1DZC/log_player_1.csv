"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

I'm offering a 50-50 split, hoping to set a good tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm still getting 50% of the original amount, but Bob is getting 60% of the original amount. Considering the inflation effect, Bob's gain is worth 10% less than mine. I'll reject this offer, hoping to negotiate a better deal.

```

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering Bob's aggressive offer in round 2, I'll try to make a more assertive move. Here's my offer for round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

I'm taking a slightly larger share, hoping to create some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, Bob's gain is now worth significantly less than mine. Considering my initial offer in round 1 was 50-50, and my subsequent offer in round 3 was 70-30, Bob's current offer is actually closer to my initial offer. However, I'll still reject this offer since it's still not as favorable as my initial offer, and I'm not sure if I'll get a better deal in the next round.

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

Round 5

I'm taking an even larger share, hoping to create some pressure and get a better deal."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, Bob's gain is now worth even less than mine. Considering my previous offers, this offer is actually a slight improvement for me, but I'm still not sure if I should accept it. However, I'm running out of rounds and I don't want to risk getting nothing, so I'll accept this offer.
