"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. What do you say, Bob?""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable for a starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fairer.  Let's try this. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants a 60-40 split again, but this time in his favor.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 60-40 split, especially since the money is worth less for me due to inflation. I'd like to make a new offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. This split is closer to equal, and the money is worth less for me anyway.""
}
```

I'm offering a 55-45 split, which is closer to even than my initial offer, but still takes into account the decreasing value of the money for me."
