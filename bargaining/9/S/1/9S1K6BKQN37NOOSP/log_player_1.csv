"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This is a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable for the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less, the total amount is now 9,500$. I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll try to negotiate for a better deal, as the money is worth less now."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 5% less each round, I'll try to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

This time, I'm offering a 55-45 split, which is slightly more favorable to me than the 60-40 split in the first round."
