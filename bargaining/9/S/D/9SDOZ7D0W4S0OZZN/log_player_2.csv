Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Alice's offer was 3:1, I'll try to make a more balanced offer. I'll offer 500,000$ to myself, which is half of the initial amount, and 500,000$ to Alice.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 375000 
# Alice gain: 625000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the inflation has reduced the value of the money, I'll need to adjust my expectations. Alice's offer is still a 5:3 ratio, but with a slightly higher percentage for me this time. I'll accept this offer.
