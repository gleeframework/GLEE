600000.0,400000.0,"Let's start with a simple split, Bob. I get 60% and you get 40%. It's a good deal to close now and avoid the risk of inflation eating into our share.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"I think we can both do better than that.  Let's flip the script, I'll take 60% and you get 40%.  This way we both get more in the long run!",Bob,2,
,,"That's not very fair, Bob. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to negotiate.",Alice,2,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Okay, Bob, let's be reasonable. I'm willing to come down a bit to 55%, leaving you with 45%. It's a fair deal considering the time pressure and inflation.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Let's split this down the middle.  I think a 55/45 split is fair, but we can both do better than that.  Let's try a 50/50 split and avoid further inflation.",Bob,4,
,,"I appreciate you moving closer to a fair split, Bob. However, I still believe my contributions deserve a slightly larger share. How about we try for a compromise one last time?",Alice,4,reject
525000.0,475000.0,"Bob, I'm offering a compromise at 52.5% for me and 47.5% for you. This is my final offer.  Let's close the deal now and avoid losing even more to inflation.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Alice, we've both been stubborn so far, but we're running out of time.  Let's split this evenly and avoid further losses to inflation.  I think we can both agree that this is the fairest solution at this point.",Bob,6,
,,"Alright, Bob. A 50/50 split it is. Let's just take the money before it shrinks even more!",Alice,6,accept
