"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $10,000, leaving Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split in my favor is fairer, considering I'm taking the risk of rejecting your offer. Let's see if you agree! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it... 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think a 60-40 split in Bob's favor is fair, especially since I'm the one making the initial proposal. I'd like to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the current value of the money is 95% of its original value (due to the 5% inflation), I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more given my initial offer was more generous.""
}
```

This time, I'm offering to take 55% of the current value of the money, leaving Bob with 45%."
