"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leaving $4,000 for Bob. This is a relatively even split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it as a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's compromise! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $6,000 is still worth $6,000, but Bob's gain of $4,000 is now worth 95% of $4,000, which is $3,800.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to get a slightly better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to get a bit more. Can you offer me $5100?""
}
```

I'm asking Bob to increase his offer to $5,100, which is a slight improvement from the initial compromise."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think I deserve a slight edge.""
}
```

I'm increasing my proposed share to $5,500, while still leaving $4,500 for Bob. I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting greedy, I'm taking a bigger share this time! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, Bob's gain of $4,000 in the first round is now worth 85.74% of $4,000, which is approximately $3,429.60. My gain of $6,000 is still worth $6,000.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'm not thrilled about giving up $1,500 more than before. However, I don't want to risk going to the next round, so I'll accept this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
