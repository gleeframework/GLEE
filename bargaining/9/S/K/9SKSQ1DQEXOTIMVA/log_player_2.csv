Let's see if I can get a better deal!"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer. Let's wrap this up before inflation eats away at our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It's getting risky to keep rejecting, I'll take what I can get at this point."
