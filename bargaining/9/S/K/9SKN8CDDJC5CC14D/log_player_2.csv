**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation working against her. While her offer is slightly better than her previous one, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  I need to show her I'm serious about getting a larger share.  The longer this goes on, the more desperate she'll become, and hopefully, she'll offer a much better deal."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Let's stop wasting time, Alice. I'm proposing a 50/50 split.  It's fair, and it guarantees we both benefit. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to play hardball.  By offering a 50/50 split, I'm establishing a firm baseline. Alice can see I'm not backing down, and with the inflation working against her, she's running out of time to secure a significant advantage. This offer puts the pressure on her to make a decision - either accept a fair deal or risk losing even more with every passing round."
