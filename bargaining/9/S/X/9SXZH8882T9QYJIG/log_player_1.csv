"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the $10,000 with a 60/40 split in favor of you. This might seem like a fair deal considering the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your generosity, but I think we can do better. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor, recognizing the increasing value of money for me in subsequent rounds. This is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
