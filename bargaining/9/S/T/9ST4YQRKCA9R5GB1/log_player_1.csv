"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small amount, hoping to get the majority of the money in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation taking its toll, my gain is now worth even less.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Meeting me halfway is a reasonable proposal, but it's still a bit more than I'd like to give up.

I'll reject this offer for now. I'll wait for Bob to make another proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Time for me to make another proposal. Given that the money is worth even less now, I'll try to get a better deal.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Get closer to my number!""
}
```

I'm trying to push Bob towards my desired amount, while still leaving him with a decent chunk of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Getting closer to your number, but not quite there 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking its toll! My gain is now worth significantly less than it was in the first round.

However, Bob's offer is actually quite close to my previous offer, and I'm not sure if I can do better. I'll have to weigh the risks and benefits of accepting this offer.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now. It's not ideal, but it's better than going into the next round with a smaller amount.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
