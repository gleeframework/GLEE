"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, we can negotiate more if you don't like it.""
}
```

This way, we both get $5,000, and we can see how the game goes from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit less than 50%, but still a decent share. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money I gain is worth 5% less than the previous round, so I need to consider that when evaluating the offer.

If I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $4,000, which is worth 5% less than the $4,250 I would have gotten in the previous round. That's a bit of a loss, but it's still a decent share.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
