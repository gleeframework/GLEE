**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly anchoring on a high share for herself, even as inflation eats away at the value. While time is running out, accepting a deal heavily skewed in her favor this early isn't ideal. There's still room to negotiate, and a strong rejection might push her to be more reasonable in the next round."
