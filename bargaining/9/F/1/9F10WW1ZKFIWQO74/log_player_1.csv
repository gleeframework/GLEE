"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by proposing a 50/50 split. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money is worth less with each round, I'd better accept this offer to get the most I can.
