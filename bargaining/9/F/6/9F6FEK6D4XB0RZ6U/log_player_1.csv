Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor, as this seems like a fair starting point given the differing inflation rates."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  Since Bob rejected my previous offer, I'm taking a more moderate approach.  While the inflation rate is higher for Bob, a 60/40 split still accounts for the difference."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While this is not the ideal split, I'm starting to see the value of a deal. The inflation is starting to hit hard, and this offer is relatively close to my previous proposal."
