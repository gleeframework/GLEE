"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```
I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me the majority of the money, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new offer, I'll have to be more cautious due to the inflation. Since Bob is now offering a 50-50 split, I'll accept this offer to avoid further negotiations and potential losses due to inflation.
