"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game. 
# Bob gain: 20 
# Alice gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's better to reject this offer and see if Alice will adjust her proposal in the next round.  While 20 dollars is something, holding out could potentially get me a better deal, especially with inflation impacting future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Let's be fair and split the money evenly. I'm willing to end the game here.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Let's see if you'll accept. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While this is a better offer than the first round, the inflation is starting to hit hard. I'm still hoping for a more even split, or at least something closer to 40/60. I'll reject and see what Alice offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway on your last offer. Let's call it a day and both get something.""

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. You're getting a good deal, so consider accepting. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

I'm still not happy with the offer, and the inflation is getting out of hand. I'm hoping that Alice will realize she needs to come closer to a 50/50 split if she wants to get any money at all."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 40,

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not backing down. I think I deserve a bigger share, especially considering the inflation is eating away at our potential earnings. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

The inflation is seriously hurting my potential earnings, but I'm not going to give in to Alice's demands just yet. I'll reject and see if she'll budge closer to a 50/50 split.  We're both getting a smaller share with each passing round, so it's in her best interest to compromise as well."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 40,

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 83.22% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 33.66% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not going to back down now. I need a better deal than this to make it worth my while. You're running out of time, Bob. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is simply too low, even with the inflation. I am starting to feel the pressure, but I won't give in yet.  I have to hope that Alice realizes that we both lose more with each round."
