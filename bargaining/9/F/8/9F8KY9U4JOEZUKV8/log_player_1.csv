This is a tough one! Here's why I'm finally accepting:

* **Diminishing Returns for Bob:**  Bob's share is worth almost half its original value due to inflation. It's unlikely he'll offer anything significantly better for himself in future rounds.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a slightly better deal isn't worth the risk of Bob getting desperate and offering an even worse deal later.
* **Fairness:** A 50/50 split is objectively fair, even if I was hoping for a bit more initially. 

It's important to be strategic in negotiation, but sometimes a sure thing is better than risking a worse outcome."
