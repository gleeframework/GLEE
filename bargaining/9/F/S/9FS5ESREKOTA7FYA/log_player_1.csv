Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a pretty aggressive offer, hoping to secure a large portion of the money early on. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly less than what I offered in the first round, and I'm not willing to accept that kind of loss. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to reflect the inflation, but I'm still aiming for a large portion of the money.  I'm hoping Bob will realize that it's in his best interest to accept this offer rather than risk going to the next round and potentially getting even less."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and with the inflation hitting me hard, I need to hold out for a better deal. I'll make another counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm lowering my offer again to account for the increasing inflation, but I'm still aiming for a significant share of the money.  It's a risky move, but I'm hoping Bob will realize that it's better to accept this offer than risk the game going on and potentially losing even more in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'm not getting my ideal share, I'm at the point where I'm losing more money with each round.  Accepting the 50/50 split is the best I can do at this point."
