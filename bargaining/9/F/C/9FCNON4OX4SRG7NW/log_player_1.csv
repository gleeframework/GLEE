"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a third of the money.""
}
```

This offer gives me 70 dollars and Bob 30 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 51/49 split is fairer, reflecting my role in making the proposal. Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, the actual values are:

* My gain: 49 * 0.95 (since it's 5% less than the original 70) = 46.55
* Bob's gain: 51 * 0.9 (since it's 10% less than the original 30) = 45.9

I'm not convinced that a 51/49 split is fair, especially considering the inflation effect. I'd like to propose a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with the 51/49 split. Let's try something else.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, the total amount of money is worth 0.95^2 = 0.9025 of its original value.

I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a majority, but I think 55 is a fairer share considering the original amount.""
}
```

This offer gives me 55 dollars and Bob 45 dollars, taking into account the 5% inflation effect from the previous round."
