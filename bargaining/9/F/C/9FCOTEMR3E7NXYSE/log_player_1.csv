"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 700,000 and you get 300,000. What do you think?""
}
```

This offer gives me a slightly larger share, but still a reasonable compromise to start the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small portion, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more aggressive in my counteroffer to account for the inflation. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a very lopsided offer. I'm not willing to accept such a small share. I'll need a better deal to make it worth my while.""
}
```

I'll think of a new offer for the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation. 550,000 for me and 450,000 for you. Take it or leave it?""
}
```"

# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation taking a bigger bite out of my potential gain, I need to be even more cautious. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",

}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
