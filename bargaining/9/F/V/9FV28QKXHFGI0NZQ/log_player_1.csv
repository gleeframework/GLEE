"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm offering to give Bob $4,000 and keep $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm considering the offer...

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 5% less, I think this is a good offer for me. I'll accept it!
