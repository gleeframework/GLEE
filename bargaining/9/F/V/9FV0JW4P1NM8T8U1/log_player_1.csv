Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a pretty aggressive offer, hoping Bob is willing to take a small share to get something rather than risk getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I'm not going to accept that offer. Bob is just being greedy! I'm going to try and negotiate a more fair split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm going to propose an even split.  Hopefully, Bob realizes that we both have a better chance of getting something if we cooperate."
