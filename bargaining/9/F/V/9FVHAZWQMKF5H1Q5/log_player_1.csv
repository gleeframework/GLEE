"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing to split the $10,000 equally between us, with each of us getting $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have less, I'm willing to give you a better deal this round! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 20% decrease in my potential gain, but I'm willing to consider Bob's offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting this offer because I feel like I'm giving up too much. I was hoping for a more even split, and this proposal still favors Bob too much. I'll wait for the next round to make my own offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I still want a fair share!""}

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a slightly better deal and still getting a decent share for myself."
