"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, Alice proposes to take $60 and leave $40 for Bob, with a message suggesting that this division is somewhat fair but slightly biased in her favor. The message is an attempt to persuade Bob to accept the offer by framing it as a reasonable compromise, despite the uneven split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fair, considering the money will lose value with each round. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlice decides to reject Bob's offer, likely because she believes she can negotiate for a better split in the next round or is unwilling to accept less than half of the money. The fact that the money is worth the same to her in each round means she doesn't feel the pressure of inflation that Bob does, giving her more flexibility to continue negotiating."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm being generous""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, Alice adjusts her offer slightly, proposing to take $57 and leave $43 for Bob. She frames this as a generous offer, considering that the money's value remains constant for her but decreases for Bob with each round. This approach aims to pressure Bob into accepting by highlighting the potential loss of value if he continues to reject offers."
