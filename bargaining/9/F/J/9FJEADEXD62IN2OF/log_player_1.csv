"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can end this quickly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, Alice. This is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 0% less for me, I'm still looking to maximize my gain. Meeting in the middle might not be the best option for me, especially since Bob's gain is worth 10% less than in the previous round.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better deal for myself.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's gain is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll aim to take advantage of that. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more. Consider this a slightly better offer, Bob.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,500, which is still a decent compromise, but I'm keeping $5,500 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, Alice. But I'm not going to give away too much. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 0% less for me, I'm still looking to maximize my gain. Bob's offer is a bit better than my previous one, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

However, considering the inflation, Bob's gain is worth significantly less than in the first round, so I'll consider this a good opportunity to take a bit more. I'll accept Bob's offer.
