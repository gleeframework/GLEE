"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take this offer! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to take advantage of the situation.

I'll reject his offer and try to get a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You're trying to take more than your fair share, I'm not buying it!""
}
```

It's my turn to make the next offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, I'm willing to give you a bit more!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise, hoping Bob will accept this offer."
