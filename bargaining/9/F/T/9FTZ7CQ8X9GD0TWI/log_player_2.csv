Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is a fairer starting point, considering the inflation we need to take into account.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The value decreases with each round. I propose a 50/50 split to end this fairly before we both lose out. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000
