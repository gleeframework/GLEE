"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn to decide.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 80% of the initial $10,000, and Bob will get 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split this evenly, Alice.  Fair is fair, right? 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less in the second round, the actual amounts are:

* Alice's gain: $5000 x 0.95 = $4750
* Bob's gain: $5000 x 0.95 = $4750

I'll reject this offer since it's not as favorable as my previous one, and I'd like to try to negotiate further.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less in the third round, the actual amounts are:

* Alice's gain: $4750 x 0.95 = $4512.50
* Bob's gain: $4750 x 0.95 = $4512.50

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Your turn to decide.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the remaining $9,375 (after inflation), and Bob will get 40%."
