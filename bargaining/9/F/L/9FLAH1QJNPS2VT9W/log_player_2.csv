Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my share is decreasing faster. I'll decrease my offer, but still need a bigger share than 50%. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is trying to use the inflation to her advantage, but her offer is still heavily skewed in her favor. I need to hold out for a better deal."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still not convinced by your 'final offer'. The difference in inflation is making every round more expensive for me. Meet me at 57% or we'll keep playing. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is getting desperate, but she's bluffing.  While the inflation is worse for her, waiting until the very last rounds to accept will hurt us both significantly. I need to stand firm but signal I'm willing to compromise slightly."
