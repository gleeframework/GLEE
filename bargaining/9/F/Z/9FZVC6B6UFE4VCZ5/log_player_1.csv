"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it almost equally""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will see the reason in my proposal and accept it, so we can both walk away with a good amount of money!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that. I'm offering you a bit less, but let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5250,
  ""bob_gain"": 4750,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, let's meet in the middle""
}
```

I'm hoping this revised offer will be more appealing to Bob, considering the decreasing value of the money due to inflation."
