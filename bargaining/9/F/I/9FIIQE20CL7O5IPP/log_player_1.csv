Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $45 and taking $55 for myself, with a message that suggests I'm being generous by not taking more. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your turn to be fair,  I'll take a bit more this time. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting Bob's offer of $45 for myself and $55 for him. The offer is similar to what I proposed in the first round, but now the money is worth 5% less due to inflation. I think I can get a better deal in the next round. Let's proceed!"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Come on, let's meet in the middle already!""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $48 and taking $52 for myself, with a message that suggests we should compromise and meet in the middle.

# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting Bob's offer of $48 for myself and $52 for him. Although the offer seems reasonable, the money is now worth 14.26% less than in the first round due to inflation. I think I can still negotiate a better deal, considering the decreasing value of the money. Let's proceed to the next round!"

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Inflation is killing us, 50/50 is the only fair way now!""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $50 and taking $50 for myself, with a message that emphasizes the impact of inflation on our negotiations.
