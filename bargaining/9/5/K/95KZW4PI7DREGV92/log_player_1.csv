"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a generous 40% of the total amount. I'll keep $600,000 for myself. The message is a friendly one, inviting Bob to make a counteroffer or accept my proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering our respective inflation rates. Let's see what you think. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks a 60/40 split is fairer, but that's exactly what I offered in the first round! I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not a good enough offer. I'll do better than that.""
}
```

I'm not accepting Bob's offer, and I'm telling him that I expect a better deal. Let's see what he'll propose next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, so I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new offer:

  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. Your turn!""
