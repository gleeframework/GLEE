"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start to our negotiation!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a good starting point. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 5% less due to inflation, I'm now considering a new offer.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'd like to negotiate further to get a higher share. His offer is still too skewed towards him, and I think I can do better."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 5% less again due to inflation, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think I deserve a bit more for my efforts!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $550,000 and keeping $450,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think this is a fair split considering the initial proposal was 60-40. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because, although it's a slight improvement from his previous offer, it's still not enough considering the decreasing value of money due to inflation. I think I can do better than a 52.5-47.5 split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The value of the money is continuing to erode, so I need to be strategic with my next offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to ensure I'm not losing out too much to inflation!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $580,000 and keeping $420,000 for myself, trying to balance the split to account for the decreasing value of money."
