I'm starting with a relatively aggressive offer, aiming for a large share. I believe Bob will likely reject it, but it sets the stage for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob's offer is significantly less favorable to me than my initial proposal. I'm rejecting this offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
``` 

I'm increasing my offer to Bob, hoping to find a compromise that we both can agree on.  It's still a substantial gain for me, but more reasonable than my previous offer."
