"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is 20% of the original amount, and keeping $8,000 for myself, which is 80% of the original amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly. This way, we both get a good amount and avoid the risk of losing value in the next rounds. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that splitting it evenly is the best option, considering the inflation rates. If we split it evenly now, I'll be giving up more value than I should, considering that Bob's gain is worth 20% less than mine. I'd like to negotiate further to try to get a better deal."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation rates, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,

# Bob gain: 6000
