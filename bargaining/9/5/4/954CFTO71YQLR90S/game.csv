5000.0,5000.0,"Let's be fair and split the money evenly. This way, we both get a good amount and avoid the risk of losing value in the next rounds.",Bob,2,

6000.0,4000.0,"I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a better deal than splitting it evenly, considering the inflation rates.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Let's make a deal. I'm willing to take a bit more than an even split, but I think this is a fair offer considering the inflation. We can avoid further losses and both come out with a decent amount.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
7000.0,3000.0,"I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much value due to inflation. This is my best offer so far.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
3000.0,7000.0,"I think we're both getting a bit greedy now. Inflation is starting to hurt. Let's agree on this split, it's a better deal than what we would get if we keep rejecting each other's offers.",Bob,6,

6000.0,4000.0,"We're getting close to the end, and the money is losing value quickly. Let's compromise on this split. We can both get a decent amount, and avoid the risk of getting nothing.",Bob,8,

8000.0,2000.0,"Alice, we're running out of time, and both of us are losing money with each round. I'm willing to take a small share just to avoid getting nothing. Let's accept this offer and at least salvage something.",Bob,10,
