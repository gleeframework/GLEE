Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was a bit one-sided. Let's be fair to both of us.  I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  Consider that with the inflation, waiting any longer will just hurt us both. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
