Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer was a bit one-sided. Let's be fair to both of us.  I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  Consider that with the inflation, waiting any longer will just hurt us both.""

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire for a bigger share, but I'm willing to compromise. This offer is closer to a 50/50 split, which feels more equitable.  Let's not let inflation continue to eat away at our potential gains.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
