I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer. I'll have to think carefully...

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really biting now! With the 88.2% inflation from the first four rounds, my offer needs to be adjusted accordingly. Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4.5,
  ""bob_gain"": 95.5,
  ""message"": ""I'm desperate, take the rest!""
}
```

I'm offering to take a mere 4.5 dollars and leave the remaining 95.5 dollars for Bob. It's a tough pill to swallow, but I'm hoping Bob will see that it's the best I can do given the inflation."
