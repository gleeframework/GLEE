"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a clean slate!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we each get $500,000. This is a good starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started with an unfair offer, now it's your turn to compromise! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not happy with the 60/40 split, but I'm willing to compromise.
