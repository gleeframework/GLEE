"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split somewhat fairly, Bob, but with a slight advantage for me to kick things off.  We can both do better than waiting for later rounds. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. The 5% decrease in value isn't too significant yet, and I believe I can negotiate a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's aim for a more balanced split, considering the depreciation. This way, we both get a substantial amount without waiting further.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want a good chunk of this money.  Let's stop wasting time with the back and forth. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both benefit the most before inflation eats away at it further. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nA 50/50 split is indeed the fairest offer, and considering the increasing impact of inflation, it's wise to accept this offer and secure the money before its value decreases further."
