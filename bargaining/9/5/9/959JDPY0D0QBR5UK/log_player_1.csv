"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to get it over with!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to get the game started and see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a larger share this round, but it's still a fair deal! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the money I gain is worth 5% less, so I need to think carefully about this offer. Considering Bob's proposal, I'll have to weigh the benefits of getting a smaller share now against the risk of getting a worse deal in future rounds.

I'll reject this offer for now:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 30,
  ""bob_gain"": 70,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a larger share this round, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of!""
}
```

I'm trying to be more generous, but still keep a decent amount for myself, considering the inflation effect."
