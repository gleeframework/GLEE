"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

This offer gives me a significant advantage, but it's reasonable enough that Bob might accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I prefer my previous offer, accepting this one guarantees I get something.  The inflation is starting to bite, and it's not worth risking getting nothing by rejecting."
