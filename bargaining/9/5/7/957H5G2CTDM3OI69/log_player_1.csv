Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

I'm offering you 30 dollars, and I'll take the remaining 70 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'm actually getting 60 dollars that's equivalent to 48 dollars in the first round. And Bob is offering me 40 dollars that's equivalent to 36 dollars in the first round.

I think I can do better than that. I'll reject this offer.
