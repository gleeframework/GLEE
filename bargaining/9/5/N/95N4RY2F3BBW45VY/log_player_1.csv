I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  This is a fair starting point, given the potential for inflation to affect Bob more heavily."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}

I'm going to decrease my share a bit more to see if we can come to a deal.  I'm still offering an 80/20 split in my favor, acknowledging that inflation is impacting Bob's share more significantly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob's offer is still too low. Although the inflation hit him harder, I still need a much better deal than this to accept."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm willing to go down to a 70/30 split.  Inflation is hurting both of us, and we need to find a compromise.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I hope Bob will see that."
