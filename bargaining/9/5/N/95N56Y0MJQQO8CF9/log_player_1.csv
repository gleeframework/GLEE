I'm going to try to get as much of the money as possible, but I also want to ensure that Bob has some incentive to accept the offer.  I think a 990,000/10,000 split is a good starting point."

While Bob's offer is much better than his previous proposal, I am still confident that I can get a better deal.  I have lost a significant amount of potential earnings due to inflation, but it's still worth waiting and seeing if I can improve my position."
