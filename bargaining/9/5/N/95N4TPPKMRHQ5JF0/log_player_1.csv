"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\nI am offering $6000 for myself and $4000 for Bob. I included the message ""Let's divide fairly"" to convey that my offer is reasonable and we can both walk away with a decent amount without needing further rounds, which would devalue the money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. Let's be reasonable, this offer prevents further losses from inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI am rejecting Bob's offer because, despite the inflation, his proposed division seems less fair than my initial offer. The difference in the amounts we receive is too significant, and I believe we can find a more balanced distribution. Given the inflation rates, I'm willing to negotiate but not settle for an offer that seems to heavily favor Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet closer to the middle.""}\n\nGiven the effects of inflation and the fact that we both lose value with each passing round, I've adjusted my offer slightly from the first round to try and meet Bob closer to the middle, while still considering the greater loss in value he faces. This offer aims to be more appealing to Bob due to the increasing devaluation of the money, especially on his end."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. Let's end this before inflation eats away at the pot further. 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI am accepting Bob's offer in Round 4. Given the significant impact of inflation on both our potential gains, especially on Bob's end, and considering that his offer is closer to a 50/50 split than his previous one, it seems reasonable to accept this division. The difference in our gains is minimal, and further rounds would only continue to devalue the money. Accepting this offer ensures that we both walk away with a substantial amount before inflation erodes the value further."
