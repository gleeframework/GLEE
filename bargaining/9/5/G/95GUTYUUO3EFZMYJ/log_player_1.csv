"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll have to reassess the offer.

Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll calculate the effective gains as follows:

My gain: 450,000 / 0.8 = 562,500 (due to 20% inflation)
Bob's gain: 550,000 / 0.9 = 611,111 (due to 10% inflation)

Considering the adjusted values, I'll decide to reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In round 3, I'll make a new offer. Considering the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll aim to adjust my offer accordingly.

Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 490000,
  ""bob_gain"": 510000
}
```

This time, I'm offering to take 49% of the remaining $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 51%."
