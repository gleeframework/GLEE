"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
```

This offer gives me a large share of the money, as I want to maximize my gains in the first round. However, I am still offering Bob a small amount to make it more likely he will accept the offer and avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While this offer is significantly better than the first round's offer in terms of my immediate gain, I'm still not satisfied.  I'm confident that I can secure a better deal in the next round. The inflation will affect Bob's gain more than mine, making it in his best interest to come back to me with a more equitable proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
```

I'm increasing my share again, but this time it's more moderate to make it appealing to Bob. The inflation is working in my favor, and I'm willing to give Bob a decent chunk to make him consider accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

The inflation has hit me hard, and Bob's offer, while not ideal, is the best I can reasonably expect at this point. It's a fair split, and the risk of further inflation is too high."
