"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the total amount is now $6,400 (80% of $8,000).

Since my gain in the previous round was 6000, which is 75% of 8000, and Alice's gain was 4000, which is 50% of 8000, I'm not sure if this offer is a good deal for me. I'll reject it.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","The money has decreased in value due to inflation, and now it's worth 64% of its original value, which is $6,400.
