Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle of our previous offers 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""This is getting us nowhere. Let's be reasonable and split it evenly.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Still willing to compromise, slightly above the middle 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate as the rounds progress and the money loses value for her. While she claims to be compromising, she's still heavily favoring herself. Bob can likely secure a better deal by continuing to hold out and propose more even splits."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""We need to reach an agreement soon.  52/48 is generous considering the time pressure.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time pressure:**  With each round, the value of the money decreases for Alice, making her more likely to accept a less favorable offer. 
* **Slight edge:** Offering 52/48 is still better for Bob than a 50/50 split, but it shows a willingness to compromise from his previous offer. 
* **Directness:**  The message emphasizes the urgency of the situation, pushing Alice towards a decision."
