"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

This means I'm offering Bob $100,000, and I'll get the remaining $900,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $500,000 is now worth $475,000 (95% of $500,000). Since Bob's gain remains the same at $500,000, I'm not sure if I'm getting the better deal.

I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, my gain of $500,000 in the previous round was worth $475,000. To account for the 5% loss, I'll aim to increase my offer to make up for it.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000
}
```"
