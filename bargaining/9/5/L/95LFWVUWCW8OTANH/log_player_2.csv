I'm Bob, and I'm not going to accept such a low offer. Let's see what Alice comes up with next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}
``` 

I'm going to start with a more equitable split. I'm confident that Alice will see the value in this offer and we can end the game amicably."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice is still being incredibly unfair.  I'm going to hold out for a better deal. The inflation doesn't affect my resolve!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}
```

I'm going to propose an even split. This is a fair deal and I'm confident Alice will see that, especially as the rounds continue and the value of the money decreases."
