"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $40, which is a relatively generous offer considering the inflation that affects him more than me. This way, Bob might be inclined to accept the offer early on, ensuring that the value of the money doesn't decrease further for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. This time, I'm offering you 40, and I'll take 60. Let's split the difference. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer because, considering the inflation that affects him, the value of the money he's offering me hasn't changed, but the value of the money he's taking has decreased. I can try to negotiate for a better deal in the next round, as Bob is more pressured by the inflation than I am."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, this is a good deal for you.""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $45, taking into account that the value of the money for him has decreased by 20% each round. This offer is slightly more generous than the initial one, considering the impact of inflation on Bob's gain. By framing it as a ""good deal"" for him, I'm hoping Bob will accept it, given that the value of the money will continue to decrease for him if we proceed to further rounds."
