"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take 70 and you can take 30. Let's settle this!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, let's split it evenly 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'll evaluate Bob's offer. Since my gain is worth 10% less, I'd be getting 50 * 0.9 = 45, and Bob would be getting 50 * 0.95 = 47.5.

I'm not sure if I want to accept a split that's not as favorable to me as my original offer, especially considering the inflation. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money. I'll aim for a higher percentage of the remaining value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly lower share, but I'm still willing to meet you halfway. Let's settle now!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a bit more favorable to me, considering the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but I'm willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation:

My gain is worth 27.1% less than the original $70, so I'd get 70 * 0.7273 = 50.98 (approximately).
Bob's gain is worth 14.26% less than the original $30, so he'd get 30 * 0.8554 = 25.66 (approximately).

Considering the current values, I'd be getting less than I initially proposed in round 1, and Bob's gain is actually closer to what I proposed in round 3. Given the inflation and the decreasing value of the money, I think this is a reasonable offer. I'll accept it.
