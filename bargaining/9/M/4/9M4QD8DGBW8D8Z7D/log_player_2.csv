Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, I'm willing to compromise, but I still want a larger share. Let's meet in the middle of my initial offer and your last proposal. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is showing some willingness to negotiate, the current offer is still heavily skewed in her favor. Accepting now would mean losing a significant amount of potential earnings due to inflation. I'm betting on Alice becoming more agreeable as we get closer to the deadline."

Round 4

{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your point, but I still believe I deserve a bit more. Considering the inflation, my new offer is slightly more generous. Take it before the money loses more value for you. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**  Alice is inching closer, but it's too slow.  The slight increase in my share doesn't compensate for the accelerating inflation losses. A firm rejection sends a message that I'm serious about a fairer deal and won't be pressured by the dwindling time."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 480000,
""alice_gain"": 520000,
""message"": ""Alice, time is running out. This is my final compromise. I'm willing to accept slightly less than a 50/50 split, but this is as low as I'm willing to go.  Let's close this deal and avoid a mutually disastrous outcome.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're getting desperate, but I'm not backing down. My offer is still more generous than before. You should take it before the inflation eats away even more of your share. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  The situation has become critical. While the current offer isn't ideal, rejecting it carries a massive risk. With each round, the potential losses due to inflation escalate, and the remaining time for negotiation shrinks. Accepting a less-than-ideal offer is now preferable to risking a complete loss if Alice refuses to budge further."
