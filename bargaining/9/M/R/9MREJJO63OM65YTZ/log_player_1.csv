Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going for a slightly greedy approach, taking 95% and leaving Bob with 5%. This leaves room for negotiation in later rounds if he rejects, but I'm hoping he'll accept this early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, it's better to take the 70% now than risk getting nothing at all.  The inflation factor makes it risky to keep rejecting offers."
