Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60/40 is a fair split, but I'm going to propose the other way around this time. I'm willing to take the bigger share, but let's not forget about inflation! If we keep going, we'll both end up with less. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
