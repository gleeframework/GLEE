**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is still slightly in his favor, it's becoming increasingly risky to continue rejecting. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  Every round that passes eats into Bob's potential gains, making my offers more appealing in the long run. However, there's no guarantee he'll be rational enough to accept an offer heavily favoring me later on.
* **Time Pressure:** The longer the game goes, the greater the chance Bob will make a desperate, lowball offer in an attempt to salvage some value. 
* **Current Offer:**  600,000 is still a substantial amount. Accepting now guarantees a good payout.

It's a gamble to hope for a better offer in later rounds, and the current deal presents an acceptable compromise."
