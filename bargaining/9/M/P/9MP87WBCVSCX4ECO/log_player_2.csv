Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting closer, but I still want a bit more 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

The game dynamics are shifting rapidly against Bob due to inflation. While Alice is consistently aiming for a 60/40 split in her favor, Bob's buying power diminishes with every round. Accepting Alice's offer in Round 5 yields 430,000, which, while significantly less than his initial goal, is still better than risking further losses from inflation in subsequent rounds."
