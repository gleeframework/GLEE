Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm starting with a very generous offer, hoping to secure a quick deal.  I'm confident I can get a good share of the money even with some inflation.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I'd prefer more, this is a fair deal, and with inflation looming, it's unwise to risk getting nothing."
