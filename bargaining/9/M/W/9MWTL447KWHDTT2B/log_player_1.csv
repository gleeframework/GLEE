"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

This way, I get 80% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new offer, the money I would gain is worth 80% of the initial $1,000,000, but due to inflation, it's now worth 80% of 80% of $1,000,000, which is 64% of the initial $1,000,000.

I will accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
