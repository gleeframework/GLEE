"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 650000,
""bob_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable. This offer still leaves you with a significant sum.""
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Early Advantage:**  As Alice, I'm hurt more by inflation.  It's in my best interest to secure a deal quickly.
* **Strong Opening:** Offering Bob $350,000 is substantial and might be tempting enough for him to accept immediately.
* **Setting a Tone:**  The message aims to frame the offer as fair and encourage a swift resolution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a fair split, considering the inflation we both face. Let's end this now. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's message frames his offer as fair, it's heavily skewed in his favor. Accepting this offer would leave me with significantly less than what I aimed for in Round 1, even considering the inflation.  

It's a gamble, but I believe I can still negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I'm aiming for a more balanced agreement. This offer considers the time pressure we both face.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conceding Ground:** I'm reducing my initial ask to show flexibility and encourage Bob to settle.
* **Time Pressure:** Both our potential gains are decreasing.  While I rejected Bob's offer, the message acknowledges the shared time constraint.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** This offer moves closer to a 50/50 split, which might be more appealing to Bob than my previous offer, especially with the increasing inflation."
