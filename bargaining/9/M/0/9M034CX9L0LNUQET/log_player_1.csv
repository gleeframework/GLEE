{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point.""}

# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I should get a bit more 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about the offer, and I think I can do better. I was hoping to get a bit more than $5,000, and I'm not willing to accept an equal split at this point. I'll reject the offer and make a new one in the next round."

Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I still think I deserve a bit more.""}

I'm proposing that I get $5,500 and Bob gets $4,500. I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I still think I deserve a slightly larger share. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer."

# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy about the offer, and I think I can do better. With the money being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'm feeling the pinch of inflation. However, I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives Bob a larger share than me. I'll reject this offer and try to make a better one in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4800, ""bob_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much""}

I'm proposing that I get $4,800 and Bob gets $5,200. I'm trying to find a compromise that takes into account the effects of inflation, but I'm still trying to hold onto a slightly larger share. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think I'm getting a bit shortchanged 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm not thrilled about the offer, but considering the effects of inflation, I think this is the best I can get. With the money being worth 40.95% less than in the first round, I'm feeling the pinch even more. I think accepting this offer is the best way to salvage what's left. I'll take the $5,200 and hope that Bob will be satisfied with the $4,800."
