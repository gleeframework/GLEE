"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here""
}
```

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 evenly, with each of us getting $6,000. This is a fair starting point, and we can discuss and adjust from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try for a 50/50 split this time 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'm not as keen on giving up as much as I was in the first round.

I'll reject Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a slightly better deal and still getting a good amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly better deal 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","With the increased inflation, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. I'm not sure if this is the best I can get.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

It's not a great deal, but it's better than nothing, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with even lower values."
