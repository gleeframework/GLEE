"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split.  I'm willing to give you a bit more since you'll be getting less in the future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
I'm going to reject this offer.  While it's a fair starting point, I'm hoping to get a slightly better deal knowing that the money will be worth less to Alice in the future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, but I think I can get a slightly better deal knowing that the value of the money will decrease faster for you than for me.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think it's time for an even split.  With inflation hitting us both, let's agree on a fair deal and be done with it. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
With the value of the money decreasing so rapidly, I think it's best to accept this even split. I'm not sure I can get a better deal in the next round, and the risk of losing even more value is too high."
