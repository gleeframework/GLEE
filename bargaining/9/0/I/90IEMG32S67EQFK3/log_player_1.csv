"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 6:4 split in my favor, acknowledging your risk of inflation, but I'm confident we can find a more balanced deal that benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
