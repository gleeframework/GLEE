"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\nMy proposal is to divide the money fairly, with me receiving $550,000 and Bob receiving $450,000. This way, we both get a significant share, and we can avoid further rounds where the money loses value due to inflation. I believe this is a reasonable and mutually beneficial offer.\n\nPlease let me know if Bob accepts or decides to proceed to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is better for both of us in the long run. I'm being very fair. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject Bob's offer. Although he claims to be fair, his proposal gives him a larger share than what I offered in the first round, and considering the inflation, my share is now worth even less. I'm not convinced that this is the best deal for me, so I'll proceed to the next round and make a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Equal split to minimize loss""}\n\nGiven the decreasing value of the money due to inflation, I propose an equal split of $500,000 each. This way, we both get the same amount, and we can minimize our losses from further rounds. It's a straightforward and fair offer that should satisfy both parties.\n\nPlease let me know if Bob accepts or decides to proceed to the next round."
