"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2

""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your proposal, but I think we can find a better compromise. Let's split it 70/30, with a larger share going to me. This is my final offer.  We've both lost value already, so let's get this done. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Even with inflation, accepting 300,000 is a bad deal for Bob in the long run. He can try to push for a more equitable split, knowing Alice is incentivized to avoid further inflation. There's a chance Alice is bluffing about this being her final offer."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's stop playing games. I'm proposing a 55/45 split. This is a fair offer considering the time pressure and potential losses for both of us.  Don't let greed cloud your judgement."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  Each round costs both parties money. Bob needs to make a compelling offer that avoids further rounds.
* **Alice's Position:** Her last offer suggests she wants more than half. Bob's offer gives her a significant sum, which might be tempting given the inflation. 
* **Strong Stance:**  By calling out ""greed,"" Bob adds a psychological element, potentially swaying Alice to accept a favorable deal rather than risk getting even less later."
