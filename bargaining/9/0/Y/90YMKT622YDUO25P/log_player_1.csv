Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm offering Bob a small portion to start. This way, I can secure a large share of the money. I'm hoping he'll accept, but if not, I'll be able to adjust my offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is a significant factor.  It's better to get 500,000 now than risk getting nothing."
