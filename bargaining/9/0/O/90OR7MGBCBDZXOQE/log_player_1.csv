I'm going for a pretty lopsided offer in the first round. Since Bob's money is worth less with each round, I want to secure a large portion for myself as early as possible. Let's see what Bob does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob's offer is still pretty good for him, but I'm hoping to get a better deal. Since my money is worth less with each round, I need to be more aggressive in securing a larger share. I'll reject this offer and see if I can negotiate a better one in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to counter Bob's offer.  I'll keep the pressure on by offering a deal that is more equitable for me.  The inflation is starting to hit, so I need to get a better deal before it gets worse."
