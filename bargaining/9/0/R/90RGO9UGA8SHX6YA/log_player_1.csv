"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can negotiate further if needed.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000. My message is a friendly opening offer, inviting Bob to negotiate further if he's not satisfied."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous, I'll take this one! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is taking a larger share this time!

I'm not happy with the 75-25 split, but I'll consider it for now. I'll have to think carefully about whether to accept or reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less after the first round, and another 10% less after Bob's offer, the total amount of money is now worth 81% of its original value.

Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not giving you the majority, but I'm willing to compromise.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45-55 split in Bob's favor this time, with me getting $450,000 and Bob getting $550,000. My message is a bit more assertive, but still open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer to my target, but I still want more! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is still pushing for a larger share.

Considering the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, the total amount of money is now worth 72.9% of its original value.

I'm not thrilled about the 40-60 split, but I'll consider it for now. However, I think I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 27.1% less after the first three rounds, the total amount of money is now worth 72.9% of its original value.

Here's my new proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, no more games.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split this time, with me getting $500,000 and Bob getting $500,000. My message is a straightforward one, inviting Bob to meet me halfway and end the game."
