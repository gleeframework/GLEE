"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose to take 90 dollars and give Bob 10 dollars. This is a strong opening offer, as I get the majority of the money, but it still leaves Bob with something. This should incentivize him to accept, but if he rejects, I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal for myself in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer to get more than 50 dollars, it's important to consider the inflation. Accepting this offer guarantees me 50 dollars, which is better than risking getting nothing in the later rounds due to further inflation."
