"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $1,000,000 equally, with each of us getting $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit less, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not satisfied with Bob's offer, as I would be getting $400,000, which is less than half of the total amount. I'm hoping for a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of!""}

I'm proposing that I get $550,000 and Bob gets $450,000. I'm trying to find a balance between being fair and getting a good deal for myself."
