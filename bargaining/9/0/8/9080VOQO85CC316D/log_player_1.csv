Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 9000/1000 split, keeping the majority for myself as the first proposer. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even with the inflation, this offer is still beneficial for me. It's better than the 5% loss I'd face if I reject and go to round 3."
