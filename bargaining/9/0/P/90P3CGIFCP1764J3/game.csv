900000.0,100000.0,"Let's start fair.  I'm taking the lion's share, but I'm willing to give you a decent chunk to start with.  Accept this and we can both walk away with something.",Alice,1,

350000.0,650000.0,"That's a tough start, Alice. Let's be more realistic. I'm proposing a 65/35 split in my favor.  This accounts for the inflation working against me more heavily.  It's a fair deal that gives us both a good amount.",Bob,2,

700000.0,300000.0,"Okay, I'll budge a little more.  I'm still taking the bigger share, but this is a significant concession.  Let's not keep going back and forth - accept this and we can move on.",Alice,3,

450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, we're getting nowhere fast.  The clock is ticking and that money is losing value. I'm coming down to 550,000 for me, leaving you with 450,000. It's a reasonable offer considering the inflation disparity. Let's be practical and end this.",Bob,4,

600000.0,400000.0,"We're getting closer, Bob.  I'm willing to compromise further, but I need a bigger share.  Let's be realistic - this is a good deal for both of us considering the time we're wasting and the value of the money dropping.",Alice,5,

475000.0,525000.0,"Alice, this back and forth is pointless.  The value is literally evaporating with every round.  I'm offering you 475,000 - take it or leave it. This is my final offer - I'm aiming for a larger share in the next round if this fails.",Bob,6,
