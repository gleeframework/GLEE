Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'll start by offering a slightly unfair split, keeping 90% for myself. This is to test the waters and see how Bob responds.  Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is a fair 50/50 split, and even with the inflation, it's still a good deal for me. Accepting this offer means we both get a decent amount of money, and the game ends."
