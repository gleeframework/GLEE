"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. It's a fairer split than your previous offer, and we can both walk away with a decent amount of money. Let's avoid further rounds and the risk of losing value. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{
