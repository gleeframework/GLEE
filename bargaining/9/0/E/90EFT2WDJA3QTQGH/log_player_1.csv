"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 80/20, a fair and reasonable start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $10,000, which is $8,000, and Bob gets the remaining 20%, which is $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, let's make a deal! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my expectations. Bob's offer is 4000 for me and 6000 for him. That's a pretty big gap, but I don't want to risk going to the next round and losing more value.

I'll decide to accept Bob's offer for now. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
