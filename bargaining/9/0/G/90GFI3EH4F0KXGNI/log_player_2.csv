"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer ensures we both benefit from a swift resolution. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nIn this scenario, accepting the offer would give Bob $350,000, which is less than half of the total amount. Considering the inflation factor, where the money is worth 5% less for Bob in each subsequent round, it might still be beneficial for Bob to hold out for a better offer in the next rounds, hoping that the potential loss due to inflation could be offset by a more favorable division. Given the significant difference in the inflation impact between Bob and Alice (5% for Bob vs. 20% for Alice), Bob might strategize that Alice has more to lose from prolonging the game, which could prompt her to offer a more favorable division in subsequent rounds to avoid further devaluation of her potential gain. Therefore, Bob decides to reject the offer, aiming for a better outcome in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 520000, ""alice_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, this is a fair offer. You lose more if we delay.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this proposal, Bob takes into account the inflation factor affecting both players. Given that Alice's share devalues more significantly with each passing round (20% decrease for her vs. a 5% decrease for Bob), Bob's strategy is to present an offer that might appear more balanced when considering the devaluation impact. By offering Alice $480,000, Bob is attempting to persuade her that, due to the substantial decrease in value she experiences with each round, accepting this offer now would be more beneficial than risking further rounds where her potential gain could significantly diminish. This approach aims to appeal to Alice's self-interest in preserving the value of her share, hoping she will accept to avoid further losses."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's end this. My offer is still generous considering the inflation working against me. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, despite the inflation affecting both players, Alice's offer does not significantly improve from Bob's perspective, especially considering the devaluation impact. Alice's share is now worth 36% less than in the first round, while Bob's is worth 9.75% less. Given this disparity, Bob might calculate that Alice is under more pressure to conclude the game due to her more substantial loss in value over time. Therefore, Bob decides to reject the offer, betting that in the next round, Alice will be more inclined to accept a division that is even more favorable to Bob, or that she will propose a better offer herself to avoid further devaluation of her share. Bob is leveraging the greater impact of inflation on Alice's potential gain as a bargaining chip to aim for a better outcome."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 580000, ""alice_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Inflation is hitting you harder. This is a fair adjustment.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, Bob adjusts his offer to reflect the increasing pressure of inflation on Alice's potential gain. Given that Alice's share is now worth 36% less than in the first round, Bob takes a firmer stance, proposing that he takes $580,000, leaving Alice with $420,000. Bob's message aims to reason with Alice, pointing out that due to the uneven impact of inflation, his offer is a fair adjustment to the circumstances. He is betting that the significant loss Alice faces with each passing round will compel her to accept this offer, which, despite being less favorable to her than previous ones, still provides her with a substantial sum. Bob's strategy is to maximize his gain while still presenting the offer as a reasonable compromise, considering the game's progression and the impact of inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Let's split it evenly and call it a day.  Any more delays and we'll both be worse off. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, considering the significant impact of inflation on both players' potential gains, Alice's offer to split the money evenly becomes a more attractive option for Bob. Given that the money he gains is now worth 18.55% less than in the first round, and Alice's share is worth 59.04% less, the even split seems like a reasonable compromise. The fact that Alice is willing to accept an equal division at this stage suggests that she recognizes the diminishing value of prolonging the game further. Bob, realizing that any further attempts to negotiate for a higher share could result in both parties losing even more value, decides to accept the offer. This decision ensures that Bob secures a substantial amount, albeit reduced by inflation, without risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds. The strategy shifts from maximizing gain to mitigating loss, as the even split under the current circumstances appears to be the most pragmatic conclusion to the game."
