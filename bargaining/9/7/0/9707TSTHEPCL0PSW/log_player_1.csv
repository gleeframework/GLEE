"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a small share, but I think this is a fair start.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $20 and keeping $80 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a larger share, but I think this is a fair start for me too. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 20% less, I need to consider the effective value of the offer.

In the first round, I offered Bob $20, which is equivalent to 20% of the total. In this round, Bob is offering me $60, which is equivalent to 60% of the total.

Considering the inflation, Bob's offer is actually more generous than my initial offer. I'll accept this offer.
