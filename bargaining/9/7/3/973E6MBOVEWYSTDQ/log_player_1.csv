"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the money and leave 40% for Bob. This is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You got a good deal in round 1, I'm trying to be more generous now 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm glad Bob thinks I got a good deal in round 1!

However, I'm not sure I want to accept this offer. With the 20% inflation, my gain of 300,000 is now worth 240,000, which is a significant reduction. I'm not sure if Bob's offer is generous enough considering the reduced value of the money.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and the fact that Bob's offer was 70-30, I'll try to propose a more balanced split. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, a 55-45 split""
}
```

I'm hoping this offer is more appealing to Bob, and we can finally reach an agreement!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're trying to take advantage of me, but I'm not falling for it! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is getting a bit aggressive!

Considering the inflation, my gain of 400,000 is now worth 208,000 (48.8% of the original 400,000). I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I don't want to give Bob the satisfaction of thinking I'm taking advantage of him.

I'll accept this offer, but I'm not happy about it.
