"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round due to inflation, and my previous offer was 600,000, I'll make a new offer that's a bit more aggressive:

{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, Bob's offer seems more reasonable now. I'll accept this offer.
