Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

Let's start with an even split.  It's fair and will help us both understand how the game works."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'll reject this offer. While I'm not getting a better deal right now, I can likely get a better deal in the future. Bob will have to offer me more to get me to accept."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

I'll offer Bob a slightly lower share than the even split, but still give him a significant amount to hopefully encourage him to accept. Since I'm not losing value with inflation in this round, I can be a little bolder."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred a larger share, Bob is now losing a significant amount of value due to inflation.  This is the best deal I'm likely to get, considering that if we go on to the next round, I'll still gain the same amount while Bob's share will continue to shrink."
