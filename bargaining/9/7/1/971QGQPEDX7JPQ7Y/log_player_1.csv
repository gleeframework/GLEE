"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. This should be a good starting point, as I anticipate the money will depreciate over time, and I'd rather get a larger share now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would prefer more, this offer is still beneficial considering the inflation.  It's better to secure a share now than risk getting nothing at all."
