"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose that Alice receives $900,000 and Bob receives $100,000.  I figure this is a fair starting point, as it gives me a significant portion of the money while still leaving Bob with something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While I would prefer to get more, I think this offer is too low. Bob is taking advantage of the inflation and it's clear this isn't a fair split.  I'm hoping he'll come back with a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to propose a more even split, with Alice receiving $700,000 and Bob receiving $300,000. I think this offer is fair given the inflation that has already occurred."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, given the amount of inflation that has occurred. Even though the money is worth significantly less for me now, I am still not willing to accept this offer. I believe I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob $400,000 and keep $600,000 for myself. Given the inflation, this seems like a fair and achievable split. We're both losing value with every passing round, and I believe this offer shows a willingness to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

With each round passing, the value of my portion is shrinking rapidly. While an even split isn't ideal, accepting this offer guarantees me something, whereas rejecting it could result in getting nothing."
