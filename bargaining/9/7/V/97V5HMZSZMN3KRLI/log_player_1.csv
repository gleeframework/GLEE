"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can find a better solution, but let's try a 60/40 split for now. It's a fair offer considering inflation will benefit me more in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
