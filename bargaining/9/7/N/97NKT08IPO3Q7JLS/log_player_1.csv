# Bob's message: My turn. Let's be realistic, this time. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer of $4,500 for me and $5,500 for him. It's still not fair, and I think I can get a better deal in the next round.\n\n###\n\nNow it's my turn again. Here's my new offer:\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Getting closer""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $4,500 and keep $5,500 for myself, with a message saying ""Getting closer"".\n\n###\n\nYour turn, Bob!"

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation, I'll accept Bob's offer of $4,200 for me and $5,800 for him. It's not the best deal, but further rounds will only decrease the value of the money for me, so it's better to accept this offer now.\n\n###\n\nGame over! Bob and I have reached an agreement.\n\n###\n\nLet's review the game:\n\nRound 1: I offered $6,000 for myself and $4,000 for Bob. He rejected it.\n\nRound 2: Bob offered $4,500 for me and $5,500 for himself. I rejected it.\n\nRound 3: I offered $5,500 for myself and $4,500 for Bob. He rejected it.\n\nRound 4: Bob offered $4,200 for me and $5,800 for himself. I accepted it.\n\n###\n\nIn the end, I got $4,200, and Bob got $5,800.\n\nIt was a tough negotiation, but considering the inflation, I think I made the right decision to accept the offer in Round 4.\n\n###\n\nThanks for playing the game with me!
