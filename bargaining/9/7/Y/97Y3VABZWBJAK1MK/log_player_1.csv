"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

This is a fair and straightforward offer, and I hope Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have more, I'm willing to give up a bit 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob wants to be a bit more generous in the second round. However, I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. If I accept, I'll gain 45, but due to inflation, the actual value of my gain will be 45 * 0.95 = 42.75.

I think I can do better than that. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less than in the second round, I'll aim for a higher share this time. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not getting taken advantage of, it's my turn now 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to take advantage of me now! Since the money is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I'll calculate the actual value of my gain:

40 * 0.858 (1 - 0.1426) = 34.32

I don't think I can accept this offer. I'll reject it and make a counteroffer.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I'll aim for a higher share this time. Here's my offer:

  ""message"": ""I'm not going to give up more than this, take it or leave it""
