```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game quickly!"

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly lower offer, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth less after inflation, I want to maximize my gain.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreased value of the money due to inflation. Since Bob's offer in the previous round was 40/60, I'll try to get a better deal by offering a higher percentage for myself.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better offer than before. Don't wait for an even lower one!""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm not going to give away too much! 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly due to inflation!

Considering the decreasing value of the money, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since Bob's previous offer was 40/60, and this one is 42/58, it's a slight improvement, but not enough to make me confident.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, and I need to make the most of it. Considering the previous offers, I'll try to get a better deal by offering a higher percentage for myself.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 48,
  ""bob_gain"": 52,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit impatient, but I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal. Take it or leave it!""
}

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going to give in yet, I think I can get a better deal 
# Alice gain: 38 
# Bob gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, and I need to make a decision quickly. Considering the previous offers, I'll have to weigh the pros and cons of accepting this offer.

Since Bob's previous offer was 42/58, and this one is 38/62, it's a slight decrease in my gain, but the difference is not significant enough to reject the offer outright.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer, hoping that it's the best I can get at this point."
