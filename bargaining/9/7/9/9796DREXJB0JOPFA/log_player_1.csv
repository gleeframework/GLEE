"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair starting point""}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, giving me $60 and Bob $40. I think this is a good starting point, and it's a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, with me getting the larger share since I'm the one proposing. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not happy about Bob's attempt to take the larger share, but I'm willing to negotiate. I'll accept his offer this time, but I'll try to make a better proposal next round.
