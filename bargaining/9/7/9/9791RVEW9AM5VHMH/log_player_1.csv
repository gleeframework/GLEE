"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60/40 is a fairer split, as I'm taking on the risk of proposing first. Let's see if you agree! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not convinced that 60/40 is a fair split, especially since I'm the one who's losing more value due to inflation. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55/45 is a better split. You're taking on more risk by proposing first, but I'm still willing to give you a decent share.""}

I'm trying to find a middle ground, taking into account the inflation and the fact that Bob proposed first."
