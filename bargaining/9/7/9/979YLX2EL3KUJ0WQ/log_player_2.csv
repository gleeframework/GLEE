{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split in my favor is a fair deal given the inflation.  Since we are both losing money, it's important to secure a good deal in the early rounds.  Let's get this settled now.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable. Your offer was heavily skewed in your favor. I'm proposing a 55/45 split, which is more balanced considering the inflation. It's our last chance for a clean deal before the money shrinks further. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
