"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split in my favor is a fair deal given the inflation.  Since we are both losing money, it's important to secure a good deal in the early rounds.  Let's get this settled now. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
