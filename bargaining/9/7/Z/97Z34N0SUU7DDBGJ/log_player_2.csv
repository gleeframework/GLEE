Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're feeling the pinch of inflation, I'm not. My offer is still generous. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While the offer is still far from ideal, the inflation is rapidly eating away at my potential gains. Accepting this offer is the best option to secure at least some money."
