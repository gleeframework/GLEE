Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're desperate, I'll take advantage 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, accepting is the most logical choice, even though it's a terrible offer. Here's why:

* **Severe Inflation:** Bob is losing almost 60% of the value each round.  Waiting any longer means he'll get even less.
* **Alice's Strategy:** Alice knows Bob is being hurt by inflation. She's unlikely to offer anything better, and will probably offer even worse in the next round.

While getting $3,000 is far from ideal, it's better than the near certainty of getting even less if Bob rejects the offer."
