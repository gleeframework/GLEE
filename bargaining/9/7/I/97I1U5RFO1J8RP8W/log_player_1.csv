"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to overthink it""}

I'm proposing that we split the $1,000,000 equally, with each of us getting $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're leaving too much on the table, let's be realistic 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not ready to give in just yet!

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I think Bob is being a bit too aggressive with his proposal. I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not ready to give up 100,000 yet. I'll make a new proposal in Round 3."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not giving up too much more""}

I'm trying to find a middle ground by offering Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping a significant portion for myself."
