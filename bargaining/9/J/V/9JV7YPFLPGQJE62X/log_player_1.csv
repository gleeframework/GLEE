"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can finish the game.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $20, which is 20% of the initial $100. I'm keeping $80 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to start. Let's end this quickly! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation, my $80 from the first round is now worth $64.

Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, which is a fair one. However, considering the inflation, I'd be getting $50, which is 62.5% of the current value of $80 (pre-inflation). I'd rather negotiate further to get a better deal.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the 20% inflation from the previous round, the $100 is now worth $80 (pre-inflation).

I'll make a new offer, taking into account the reduced value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal this time, Bob. Accept and we can finish the game.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40, which is 50% of the current value of $80. I'm keeping $60 for myself."
