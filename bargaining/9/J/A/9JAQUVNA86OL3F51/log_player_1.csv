"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 525000,
""bob_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Let's be fair and avoid excessive losses from inflation. I propose a 52.5% / 47.5% split in my favor.""
}
``` 

This offer is a strong starting point for Alice. Here's why:

* **Slightly Advantageous:** It gives Alice a slight edge (52.5%) while still offering Bob a reasonable amount. 
* **Inflation Awareness:** The message highlights the importance of settling quickly to minimize losses due to inflation. This subtly pressures Bob to accept.
* **Opens Negotiation:** Even if Bob rejects this offer, it sets a benchmark for future rounds. Bob will need to propose something better for Alice to consider accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I deserve a bit more, considering I'm taking the risk of further inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly worse for Alice than her initial proposal. Not only is Bob asking for a larger share, but the inflation means Alice's potential gain is already lower than what she offered Bob in Round 1. 

It's in Alice's best interest to counter-propose and steer the negotiation closer to a more equitable split. Bob's awareness of inflation might make him more willing to compromise in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. We both lose with every round. I propose a 50/50 split to end this quickly and fairly.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct & Firm:**  After Bob's aggressive counter-proposal, Alice needs to take a firm stance to signal she won't be easily swayed. 
* **Fairness Appeal:**  Proposing a 50/50 split emphasizes the idea of a fair outcome, making it more difficult for Bob to justify a significantly larger share for himself.
* **Urgency:**  Reiterating the impact of inflation reinforces the need for a quick resolution. 
 
This offer balances firmness with a reasonable compromise, increasing the chances Bob will accept rather than risk further losses due to inflation."
