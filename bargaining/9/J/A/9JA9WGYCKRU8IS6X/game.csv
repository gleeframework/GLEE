4000.0,6000.0,"Alice, I think a 60/40 split is more fair, with me getting the larger share.  We can still get a good amount of money if we agree now, before the value decreases further.",Bob,2,

5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but I think a 55/45 split leaning slightly in my favor is more reasonable.  The money is losing value with each round, so let's try to agree quickly!",Alice,3,

4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, let's compromise. A 55/45 split in my favor is still a good deal for both of us, and it ensures we don't lose too much more value.  Let's settle this quickly!",Bob,4,

5200.0,4800.0,"Bob, it's clear we both want a good portion of the money.  I'm proposing 52/48, a slight edge for me but still a win for both of us.  Let's be practical - the clock is ticking!",Alice,5,
