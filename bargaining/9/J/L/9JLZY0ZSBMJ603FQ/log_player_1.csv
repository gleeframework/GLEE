"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a very greedy opening offer. I'll take almost everything, leaving Bob with a single dollar. I'm banking on the fact that Bob might be more risk-averse and accept even a tiny amount rather than risk getting nothing in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a much fairer offer, and the risk of getting nothing in future rounds is too high for me. I'm accepting this deal."
