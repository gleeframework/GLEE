"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Fair split considering the inflation""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I'm proposing that I take $6000 and Bob takes $4000. Given the inflation rates, where the money is worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob with each passing round, I believe this is a fair initial split. It slightly favors me to compensate for the higher rate of inflation I'm facing, but still offers Bob a substantial amount, considering the total is $10,000. The message ""Fair split considering the inflation"" is meant to convey the reasoning behind the division, emphasizing the impact of inflation on our respective gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I cannot accept an offer where I receive less. This offer is more balanced, but leaves room for you to gain a bit before inflation impacts us too much. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI've decided to reject Bob's offer. Given the adjusted values due to inflation, accepting $4500, which is now worth 10% less, doesn't seem favorable in the long run. The difference in inflation rates between us means that with each round, the value of the money decreases more significantly for me than for Bob. I believe there's still room for negotiation to find a more equitable split, considering the impact of inflation on both our gains. Proceeding to the next round will allow me to propose a division that might better account for these dynamics."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nIn this offer, I'm proposing that I take $5800 and Bob takes $4200. Given the inflation rates and the fact that we've moved into the third round, the money is worth even less for both of us, but more significantly less for me. This offer aims to balance the need for a fair split with the urgency of finalizing the deal before inflation further devalues our potential gains. The message ""Urgency due to inflation"" is meant to convey that time is of the essence in reaching an agreement, as further delays will only result in both parties losing more value.\n###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Urgency due to inflation""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time and losing money. This is my final offer - let's be reasonable and end this. 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI've decided to accept Bob's offer. Given the significant impact of inflation on the value of the money, especially for me, further negotiations could lead to diminishing returns. The difference in inflation rates between us has already taken a substantial toll on the potential gains, and Bob's offer seems reasonable at this point. The message from Bob also suggests that this is his final offer, implying that further rejection might lead to an impasse. Accepting this offer ensures that I secure a gain, albeit less than initially hoped for, rather than risking further devaluation or the possibility of walking away with nothing if negotiations break down.\n###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}"
