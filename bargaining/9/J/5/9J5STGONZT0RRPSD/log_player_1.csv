"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to negotiate if you want more.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. I'm hoping this will be a good starting point for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  It's a fair start, and we can avoid any potential inflation issues. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my $900,000 is now worth 95% of its original value, so I'd actually be gaining $855,000. Bob's offer of splitting it evenly would mean I'd get $500,000, which is less than I would have gotten in the first round, but more than I would get if I were to continue playing.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
