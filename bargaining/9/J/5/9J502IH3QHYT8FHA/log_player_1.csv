"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, I need to adjust my thinking accordingly. My initial offer was $700,000, which is now worth 90% of its original value, so it's equivalent to $630,000 in the new round.

Bob's offer is $400,000, which is equivalent to 66.7% of my initial offer. I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, but I'll think about it...

I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In this round, the money is worth 90% of its original value, so I need to adjust my offer accordingly.

Since the money is worth 90% of its original value, I'll aim to get at least 90% of my initial target of $700,000, which is $630,000.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the equivalent value of my initial offer in this round. In the first round, I offered $700,000. In the first three rounds, the money was worth 90% of its original value, 90% of that, and 90% of that again, respectively. So, in this round, the money is worth 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.729 = 72.9% of its original value.

My initial offer of $700,000 is now worth 0.729 * $700,000 = $510,300.

Bob's offer of $450,000 is equivalent to 88.5% of my initial offer, which is a relatively small reduction. I'll accept this offer.
