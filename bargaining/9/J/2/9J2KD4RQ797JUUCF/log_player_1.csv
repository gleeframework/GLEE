"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Accept this and we can grab a coffee on me!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $70 and Bob gets $30. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game on a friendly note!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a fair split, let's end this game 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants a slightly more favorable split for himself.

I'll have to think for a moment...

I'll reject Bob's offer. I'd like to make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, no hard feelings!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is closer to my original offer, but still a reasonable compromise."
