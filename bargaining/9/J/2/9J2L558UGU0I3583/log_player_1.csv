I'll propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  I figure it's a good starting point, leaving some room for negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While I initially offered a very favorable split, I don't think I can accept being given only $1,000, especially with the added inflation.  I'll counter with a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with a 60/40 split in my favor. This is still a significant gain for Bob, and I'm willing to compromise to avoid further rounds of negotiation."
