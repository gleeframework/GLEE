"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I take a bit more considering the inflation disadvantage. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While the offer is tempting, it's better to see if Alice is willing to compromise further.  The inflation disadvantage will work in my favor with each round, and I might be able to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split this evenly. It's the fairest way to divide the money, and we both get a good share before inflation takes its toll.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you want to play fair, but the inflation is working against me.  This offer is a slight adjustment for us both to get a decent amount. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

Alice's offer is a decent compromise, and with the inflation disadvantage, I might not get a better deal in the future. Accepting this offer secures a good amount of money for me."
