I'm proposing to keep 900,000 dollars and give Bob 100,000 dollars. This seems like a fair starting point, considering the inflation factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm proposing to keep 600,000 dollars and give Bob 400,000 dollars. Since Bob rejected my previous offer, I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I still need a significant portion of the money to account for the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, the inflation is really taking a bite out of the money. It's better to take what I can get now than risk getting nothing if we keep going."
