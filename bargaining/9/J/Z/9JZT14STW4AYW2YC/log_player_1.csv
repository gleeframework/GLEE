"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split the money 80/20 in my favor.  Since you rejected my offer last round, the money is worth less to me now. This is a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{
