"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly, 60-40!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a larger share, but my offer is more reasonable considering the inflation. Let's settle this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nSince the money is worth 20% less for me in this round, Bob's offer of $5500 is actually equivalent to $4400 in the first round. Considering my initial offer was $6000, I'm not willing to accept this reduced amount. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a more reasonable compromise.""}\n\n###\n\nI've taken into account the reduced value of money for me due to inflation and adjusted my offer accordingly. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair compromise and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer, Alice. The value is decreasing with each round, let's be practical. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant decrease in the value of money for me due to inflation, Bob's offer of $5200, although lower than my previous expectations, now seems more reasonable. Since the value is decreasing with each round, accepting this offer seems like the most practical decision to avoid further loss."
