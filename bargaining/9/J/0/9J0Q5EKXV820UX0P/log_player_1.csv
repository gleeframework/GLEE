Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60/40 split in your favor. This is a fair starting point, considering the inflation that will affect our earnings in the future rounds. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
