Inflation is biting hard, but I'm trying to be reasonable. I'm offering a 6000/4000 split, which is still favorable to me but shows that I'm willing to negotiate. We only have a few rounds left, so let's try to find a solution."

We're getting very close to the end, and both of us are losing money with every round.  I'm offering a 5500/4500 split, which is more balanced and gives Bob a slightly larger share to reflect the inflation advantage he has. This is the last chance for both of us to get anything at all."
