Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's try this again.  I'm willing to give you more this time, but I need to get a good share to keep the inflation from killing me!  How about a 60/40 split? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than her first, the inflation is hitting her much harder than me. It's still early in the game, and rejecting this offer puts me in a stronger position for future rounds. She'll be increasingly desperate to make a deal as her share diminishes with each round."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Time is ticking, Alice, and that inflation isn't doing you any favors.  This is a strong offer, and it's only going to get worse for you if you decline.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Pressure Alice:**  Emphasize that time is on my side due to the difference in inflation rates. 
* **Appear Reasonable (but firm):** The offer is a slight improvement for Alice compared to my previous one, making me look slightly more flexible without giving up too much ground.
* **Aim for a Deal:** While I'm willing to push further, securing a deal now is ideal before inflation eats into my potential gains too significantly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Alright, Bob, let's be reasonable. This inflation is hurting both of us.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on this one.  55/45 split, and let's be done with this. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Favorable Split:** Alice is offering a 55/45 split in her favor, but this is actually better than my previous offer of 55/45 in *my* favor.  
* **Inflation Impact:** While I could potentially squeeze more out of her in later rounds, the inflation is starting to become a significant factor for me as well. Waiting any longer might result in a smaller net gain even if I get a slightly better split.
* **Certainty:** Accepting this offer guarantees a reasonable share without risking the possibility of walking away with nothing if we can't reach an agreement in the remaining rounds."
