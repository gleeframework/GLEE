"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\n###\nI'll start by offering a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a reasonable starting point, as it allows both of us to receive a significant amount of money. The message ""Let's divide fairly"" is a friendly and neutral phrase that invites Bob to consider the offer without feeling pressured or threatened.\n\n###\nPlease let me know Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering inflation will affect your share more. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'll reject this offer. Although inflation affects my share more, I'm not willing to give up too much of the money. A 45-55 split is not favorable to me, especially considering that Bob's share is not affected as much by inflation. I'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer.\n\n###\nPlease let me know the outcome of the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a generous offer""}\n\n###\nIn this round, I'll make a slightly more generous offer to Bob, considering the effects of inflation. A 58-42 split is still in my favor, but it shows that I'm willing to compromise. The message ""Considering inflation, this is a generous offer"" aims to convey that I'm taking into account the decreasing value of the money and that this offer is a good deal for Bob.\n\n###\nPlease let me know Bob's response."
