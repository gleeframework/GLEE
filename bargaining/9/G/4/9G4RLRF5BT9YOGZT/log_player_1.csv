"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, seems fair to me!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50-50, a fair and balanced proposal! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

I don't think a 50-50 split is a good deal for me, considering I'm already getting less value from the money due to inflation. I'd rather try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation taking a toll, I'll have to be more aggressive in my proposal. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob! You're getting a better deal than 50-50!""
}
```

I'm trying to squeeze out a bit more value from the deal, but still being somewhat generous. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly better deal. This is my final offer! 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a bite out of my potential gains!

Considering the decreasing value of the money, I think Bob's offer is getting closer to being reasonable. However, I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer or try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll have to be more aggressive in my proposal, considering the increasing inflation and the fact that I've rejected Bob's previous offer. Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5800,
  ""bob_gain"": 4200,
  ""message"": ""Last chance, Bob! This is my final offer. Take it or walk away!""
}
```

I'm trying to squeeze out as much value as possible from the deal, but I'm not sure if Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up yet! I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of either! 
# Alice gain: 5600 
# Bob gain: 4400 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains! I'm starting to feel the pinch.

Considering the decreasing value of the money, Bob's offer is getting closer to being reasonable. I'm not sure if I can do better than this, and I don't want to risk getting nothing if Bob walks away. I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer or try to negotiate further.
