"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the decrease in value, I propose we split it evenly to ensure fairness. This keeps the total at $10000 while accounting for inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
