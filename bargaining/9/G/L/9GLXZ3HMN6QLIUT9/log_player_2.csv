**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate as the rounds progress and the value of her potential winnings decreases. While her offer is getting closer to a more even split, I believe I can push for a slightly better outcome in the next round or two.  It's still early in the game."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's settle this.  This is a strong offer considering the time pressure.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's time to push a bit harder while Alice is feeling the pressure of the decreasing value. This offer is heavily skewed in my favor, but the clock is ticking for Alice. It's a calculated risk, aiming to capitalize on her disadvantageous position."
