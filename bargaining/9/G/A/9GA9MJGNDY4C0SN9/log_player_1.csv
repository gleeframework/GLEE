"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to split the $1,000,000 evenly between us, with each of us getting $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but still keep the majority 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already biting!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully. If I accept, I'll get $400,000, which is worth 90% of the original $500,000 I was offered in the first round. Not a bad deal, but I was hoping for a more even split.

However, I don't want to risk going into the next round with a smaller amount. So, I'll decide to accept Bob's offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
