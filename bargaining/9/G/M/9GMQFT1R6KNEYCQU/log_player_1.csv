"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, and see how it goes from here.""
}
```

This is a fair and equal split, and I'm curious to see how Bob will respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the lead, let's see if you'll accept this offer! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the money is worth less, and Bob's offer is quite lopsided. I'm not eager to give up a large chunk of the money, so I'll reject his offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Now it's my turn again. I'll try to make a more favorable offer this time. Since Bob was willing to take 70% of the money in the last round, I'll try to meet him halfway.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
