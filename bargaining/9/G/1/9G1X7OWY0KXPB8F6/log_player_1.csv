"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair. Inflation is a concern, but let's not rush into an uneven deal. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Bob, time is running out.  Let's settle this now. I'll agree to your 55/45 split, but with me getting the larger share.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve the larger share. Inflation is taking its toll, let's be reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While not ideal, accepting this offer ensures we both walk away with something.  Rejecting it risks getting a worse deal later, especially with the increasing effects of inflation."
