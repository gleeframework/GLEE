"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. This way, I'm giving Bob a relatively small amount, but I'm also giving him something, so he might be more likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The stakes are getting higher!

I'll think carefully about Bob's offer... Since the money is worth less with each round, I'd like to get a bigger share now. However, Bob's offer is a bit more generous than I expected, considering the inflation rates.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob's offer was more generous than I expected, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time. I'll aim to get a bigger share, considering the inflation rates.

{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value rapidly! I'll have to be more careful with my decisions.

Considering the inflation rates, Bob's offer seems reasonable. I'm getting a slightly larger share, but it's still a relatively close split. I'll take it.
