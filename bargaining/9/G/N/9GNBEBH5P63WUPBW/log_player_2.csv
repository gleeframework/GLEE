"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This offer aims to balance the division while accounting for potential inflation. Please consider it. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is decent, there's a good chance I can do better.  Since I know about the inflation, I can try to leverage it to get a bigger share.  Rejecting this offer gives me the chance to propose a split more favorable to me in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
