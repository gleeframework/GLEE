Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take the majority, but still leave you with a decent amount""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial 100$ and Bob gets 40%."

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than that. I'm willing to be a bit more flexible, but I want a fair share as well. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with the new proposal. I was hoping to get a bit more than 45% of the initial 100$. I think I can do better than that. I'll reject this offer and hope to get a better deal in the next round."
