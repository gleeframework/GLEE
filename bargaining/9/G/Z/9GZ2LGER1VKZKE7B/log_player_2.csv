**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing a waiting game, banking on the fact that inflation hurts me more than her.  While her offer is getting closer to something more reasonable, I need to hold firm a bit longer to see if she'll budge further.  Each round I reject makes my acceptance in a future round more appealing."
