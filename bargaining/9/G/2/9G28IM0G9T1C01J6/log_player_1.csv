```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, let's try for a bit more for me! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll have to consider the new values.

My proposed gain in the first round was $5,000, which is now worth 80% of its original value, so I'd be getting $4,000 in this round. Bob's proposed gain of $6,000 is worth 90% of its original value, so he'd be getting $5,400.
