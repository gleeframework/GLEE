"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take a bit more since I'm making the first offer""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40. I'm framing it as a fair split, but taking a bit more since I'm making the first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more, but I'm willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think Bob's compromise is reasonable, and I'm willing to take the $40."
