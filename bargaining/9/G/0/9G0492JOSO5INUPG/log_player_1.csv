"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the $100, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering the inflation. Let's see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more careful with the inflation in mind.

Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll have to adjust my calculation accordingly.

Considering the offer, I get 40, which is 40% of the new value of the money, and Bob gets 60, which is 60% of the new value of the money.

However, I still think I can do better. I'd like to reject this offer and make a new proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the initial offer was 60/40""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45/55 split, which is a slight adjustment from the previous offer, taking into account the inflation."
