"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

This offer is very greedy, but since I am playing as Alice, I want to maximize my share. Let's see if Bob accepts this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, it is in my best interest to accept this offer. Due to inflation, if I reject this offer and make a counter-proposal, my share will be worth even less."
