"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

This way, we both get $500,000, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slight advantage for me, but still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my $500,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, so it's worth $450,000. Bob's offer is $400,000 for me, which is a decent compromise, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject the offer for now and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth 90% of its original value, so I'll adjust my offer accordingly. I'll try to get a bit more than Bob's previous offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'd like to keep the majority.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, but still a decent offer for you! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll! My $450,000 from round 2 is now worth only $323,500 (27.1% less). I'm not sure if I want to accept an offer that's even lower than that.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 5, the money is worth 72.9% of its original value (100% - 27.1% = 72.9%). I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

I'll try to get a bit more than Bob's previous offer, but not too much, since the money is worth less.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 320000,
  ""bob_gain"": 680000,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you in the middle, but I'd like a bit more for myself.""
