**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting this offer is becoming increasingly less risky than holding out for a better deal. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:** The inflation is hitting Bob harder than Alice. Waiting longer means a significantly larger loss for Bob even if a slightly better split is achieved later.
* **Time Pressure:**  With only 7 rounds remaining, the risk of walking away with nothing increases substantially with each rejection.
* **Alice's Position:** Alice has consistently aimed for a larger share and is unlikely to agree to a split heavily favoring Bob. 

This offer is close enough to the middle ground that accepting avoids a potentially significant loss from further inflation and the risk of completely missing out on a deal."
