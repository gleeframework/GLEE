"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I deserve a bit more, considering inflation is on my side 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3

{
""alice_gain"": 500000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is indeed eating into your gains, but it's not affecting mine. I'm willing to take a bit more, considering the circumstances 
# Alice gain: 420000 
# Bob gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is correct about inflation working in his favor, his offer is getting worse for me each round. It's time to show him I'm serious about not getting lowballed.  I'm willing to risk another round of inflation to make a point."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 475000,
""bob_gain"": 525000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is it. Take it or leave it.  Another round, and inflation will erode even this offer for me. You're getting the better end of this deal - don't be greedy.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** This is a calculated risk. I'm accepting that Bob has the upper hand due to inflation working in his favor. This offer is still better for me than his last, but the firm message emphasizes the urgency and potential loss for both of us if he continues to push his luck."
