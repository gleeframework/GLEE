"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. It's a generous starting point, considering the potential for inflation in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm lowering my proposed share, but still offering a significant amount to Bob to incentivize acceptance.  Let's avoid further inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I would prefer a more equal split, the inflation is becoming a serious threat. Accepting this offer guarantees me a substantial sum, and continuing to reject offers risks losing everything."
