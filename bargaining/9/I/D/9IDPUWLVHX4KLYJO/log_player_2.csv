"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I take $60, you take $40. This gives us both a decent share. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make my proposal. The current offer doesn't quite meet my expectations, and I'm willing to take the risk of proceeding to the next round, despite the inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think we should divide the money in a way that accounts for the loss of value over time. I'm willing to take a bit more than half, but still leave you with a substantial amount.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know if Alice accepts this offer or decides to proceed to the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your point about inflation, but your offer was a bit too skewed in your favor.  Let's meet in the middle -  $55 for me, and $45 for you. This accounts for the decreasing value while still being fair. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer as well. Given the increasing impact of inflation on both our gains, I believe we can find a more mutually beneficial division. I'm willing to take a slightly higher risk to see if we can reach a more favorable agreement in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Considering the growing effect of inflation, I'm willing to adjust my proposal. I'll take a slightly larger share to account for the decreased value, but still ensure you receive a significant portion.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know if Alice accepts this offer or decides to proceed to the next round."
