"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'm willing to compromise.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me $6,000 and Bob $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I think a more equitable split is 6000 for me and 4000 for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I accept Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the $4,000 and call it a day!"
