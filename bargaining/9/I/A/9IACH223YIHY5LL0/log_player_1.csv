"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60 and you get 40. Accept?""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount, and I'm giving you a slight advantage to make it more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle? 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 20% less, so I'll have to be more careful.

Since Bob's offer is exactly in the middle, it's a reasonable proposal. I'll accept it to avoid further negotiations.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
