"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you can have 40%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a 50/50 split, but I'm not sure I want to give you the upper hand 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting that Bob wants to keep things equal, but I'm not sure I want to give him the upper hand either.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and let Bob know that I'm not willing to go for a 50/50 split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll adjust my proposal accordingly.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal this time. You'll get 45% and I'll take 55%""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit less, but I think this is a more reasonable split 
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to get a better deal, but I'm not sure I want to give him more than 40%.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and let Bob know that I'm still not willing to give him more than 40%."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth even less than before, I'll have to be even more careful with my proposal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5300,
  ""bob_gain"": 4700,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 53% is a fair share for me. You can take the rest.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
