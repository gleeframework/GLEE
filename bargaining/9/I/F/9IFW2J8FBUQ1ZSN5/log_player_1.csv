"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, it's fair and simple.""
}
```

I'm starting with a straightforward proposal, offering Bob a 50/50 split. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'll give you a small chunk. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a toll!

I'm not too thrilled about giving up 8000, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can do better than 20% of the total amount. I'd like to make a counteroffer and see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3000,
  ""bob_gain"": 7000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I still want a significant portion for myself.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share for myself and keeping the game going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'll give you a tiny bit. 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a bite out of my potential earnings!

Considering the decreasing value of the money, I'm not thrilled about getting only $1000, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can do better than 10% of the total amount, even considering the inflation. I'd like to make another counteroffer and try to get a slightly better deal."

}
```

Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering the significant decrease in value, I'm not thrilled about getting only $500. However, I'm running out of time and options, so I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can do better than 5% of the total amount, even considering the inflation. I'd like to make another counteroffer, but I'm getting desperate."

}
```

I'm trying to be realistic about the situation and the effects of inflation. I'm not sure how much more I can negotiate, so I'm making a slightly more generous offer to Bob."
