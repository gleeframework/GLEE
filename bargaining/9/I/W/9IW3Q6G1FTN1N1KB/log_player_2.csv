**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the situation, knowing the inflation hits me harder.  While her offer is getting closer to a reasonable split, I need to show firmness to get a better deal. Accepting now would make me seem desperate. There's still time to negotiate a better outcome."
