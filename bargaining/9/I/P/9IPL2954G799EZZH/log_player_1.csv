"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""I'll take it all. You can't resist my generosity!""
}
```

I'm making a bold move, asking for all the money upfront. Will Bob accept?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. I'll take the lion's share, but you get a decent chunk as well. 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","A decent chunk, huh? I'll consider it. But I'm not sure I want to give up 90% of the money so early in the game. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more balanced offer this time. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle. No need to fight over it.""
}
```

I'm aiming for a 50/50 split, hoping to make a fair deal and avoid further conflict. Will Bob accept?"
