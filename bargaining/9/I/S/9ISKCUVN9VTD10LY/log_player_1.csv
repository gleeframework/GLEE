Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 60/40 split in my favor, as I'm the one making the offer in this round. I believe this is a fair starting point, considering the inflation disadvantage Bob will face in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I prefer a 60/40 split, considering the inflation disadvantage and the fact that I would need to make an offer in the next round, accepting this 45/55 split is the best option for me."
