"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive offer, aiming to get a large share of the money. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, as it's better than getting nothing if we reach the end of the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, Bob's offer is a fair and equal split.  With the inflation, my share will be worth less, but I am willing to accept a 50/50 split rather than risk getting nothing."
