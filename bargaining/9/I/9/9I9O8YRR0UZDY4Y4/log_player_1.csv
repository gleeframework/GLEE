Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit too much in your favor.  I propose a 55/45 split. It's still in your favor, but closer to even. Remember, the longer we wait, the less money we both get. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
