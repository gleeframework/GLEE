Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very greedy offer. I'll take almost everything, leaving Bob with just $1.  I figure he might be willing to accept anything to get some money.  Since we're playing this over multiple rounds, I'll adjust my strategy if he doesn't accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

This is a much better offer for Bob, but I'm not going to accept it yet. I'm still hopeful that I can get more than $1,000. I want to see how Bob reacts to my next offer."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

I'm going to raise my offer slightly, still taking the vast majority of the money. I'm hoping this will convince Bob to accept, but I'm also preparing for the possibility that he'll want more and reject it.  I'm trying to stay ahead of the inflation curve, even if it means conceding a little bit."

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is clearly being more aggressive with his offers, and I'm not going to cave in yet. While this offer is tempting, I believe I can still negotiate for a larger share. I'm going to continue pushing for more, knowing that the inflation is working in my favor as well."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}

I'm increasing my offer again, but I'm still aiming for the majority share.  I'm trying to find a balance between being greedy and being realistic.  I need to be careful not to push Bob too far, but I also don't want to give away too much."

{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting more and more tempting, but I'm still holding out. I'm not convinced that this is the best deal I can get. I'm going to try to get a little more, even though the rounds are getting closer and closer to the end."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 980000, ""bob_gain"": 20000}
```

I'm going to mirror Bob's last offer, hoping to show him that I'm willing to compromise.  He's getting bolder with his demands, but I'm not giving up on getting a larger share. I'm still aiming for the majority, but I'm starting to realize that I might have to concede a little more to get any deal at all."

```

Bob is increasing his demands, but I still believe I can negotiate for a better deal. I'm going to hold out for a larger share, even though the pressure is mounting.

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 970000, ""bob_gain"": 30000}
```

I'm mirroring Bob's last offer again. We're both pushing for the majority, and it seems like we're locked in a pattern of counter-offers. I need to find a way to break this pattern before it's too late.  The clock is ticking, and inflation is making this more difficult."

# Alice gain: 40000

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting this offer.  The inflation is really starting to bite, and I'm not sure I can get a better deal. This is a decent compromise, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all.  I'm still disappointed that I didn't get more, but I'm willing to take what I can get at this point."
