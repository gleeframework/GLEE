I propose to keep 900,000 for myself and give Bob 100,000. This seems like a fair starting point, considering I'm the one making the proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm going to try to get a slightly better deal this time.  Since Bob was willing to take 100,000 in the previous round, I'll offer him 200,000.  This is still a significant amount, and it reduces the risk of us getting stuck in a loop of rejections."
