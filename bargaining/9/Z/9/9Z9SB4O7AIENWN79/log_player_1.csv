Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, 60-40 is a fair deal. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to go up a bit, but 5500 for me and 4500 for you seems like a fair compromise. Let's wrap this up.""}

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you where you were, but now I get the bigger share. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer ensures I get something, given the inflation.  It's better than risking getting nothing in future rounds."
