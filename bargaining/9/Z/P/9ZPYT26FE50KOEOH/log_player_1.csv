"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game on a good note."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation, eh?

I'll think carefully about this offer...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't want to give up 60% of the remaining money, especially with the value of my share decreasing with each round. I'll try to negotiate further!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Time to make a new offer!

Considering the inflation, my share is now worth even less, so I'll try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I need a fair deal""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share, but still trying to keep a decent amount for myself. Let's see if he'll accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is taking a toll on my share!

Considering the decreasing value of my share, I'll have to think carefully about this offer...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't want to give up 65% of the remaining money, especially with my share worth less and less with each round. I'll try to negotiate further and aim for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Time to make another offer!

Considering the increasing inflation, I'll try to be more aggressive with my proposal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'm not getting any younger, let's split it 40/60 and move on""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share than before, but I'm still trying to get a decent amount for myself. Let's see if he'll accept this offer!"
