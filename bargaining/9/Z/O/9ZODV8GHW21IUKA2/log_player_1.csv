Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going for a big chunk of the money right away. Since Bob's money depreciates slower than mine, I think he might accept this. Let's see!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I'd prefer more, my money is losing value rapidly. A 50/50 split is a fair compromise, and I don't want to risk losing everything by rejecting and going to another round."
