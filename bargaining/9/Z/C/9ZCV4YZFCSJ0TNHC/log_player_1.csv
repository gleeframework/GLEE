"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

This is my initial offer. I'm taking a large share, but I'm willing to give Bob a small amount to start the negotiations. I'm hoping he'll accept, but I'm prepared to counter-propose if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much better than the first round, but I still think I can get a better deal. I'll reject and see if I can get a bigger share in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

I'm offering Bob a larger share than in the first round, but I'm still keeping the majority. I'm hoping that this shows him I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also confident that I can get a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting more favorable to him, but I still think I can get a better deal.  I'll reject and see if I can get a bigger share in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to increase my offer to Bob slightly, but I'm still holding onto a larger share.  It's a calculated risk, but I think it's necessary to try and secure a better deal.  If Bob rejects again, I'll have to reassess my strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I have to accept this offer. While I am not happy with it, I recognize that the inflation is impacting Bob significantly more than me.  With the current trajectory, I am risking getting nothing at all if I keep rejecting offers.  It's better to take what I can now rather than risk losing everything in the later rounds."
