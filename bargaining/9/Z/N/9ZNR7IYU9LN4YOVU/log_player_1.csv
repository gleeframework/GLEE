Let's see if Bob is willing to accept a small share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'll reject this offer. 90/10 is still too lopsided, and I have a chance to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
``` 

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but still a significant advantage for myself.  I'm hoping this demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate, while still securing a good portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still going to reject this offer.  While it's a significant improvement from Bob's last offer, it's still not fair considering the inflation factor. I have a few rounds left, and I believe I can secure a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm raising my offer to 60/40. This is a more balanced split, and I'm hoping Bob will see it as a reasonable compromise. I'm aware of the inflation factor, but I'm still aiming for a good outcome for myself."
