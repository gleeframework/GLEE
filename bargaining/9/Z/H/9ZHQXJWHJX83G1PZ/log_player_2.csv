# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor, considering it's advantageous for both of us to settle early and avoid losses due to inflation.

# Alice gain: 600000

# Alice gain: 550000

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. The longer this goes on, the more we both lose. I'm willing to come down slightly to a 51/49 split, acknowledging the inflation effect on your end. Let's settle this now. 
# Bob gain: 490000 
# Alice gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n### Given the significant impact of inflation, which has reduced the value of the money by 18.55% for me, I believe accepting this offer is the best course of action. Further negotiations may lead to additional losses due to inflation, making this 51/49 split in Alice's favor a reasonable compromise."
