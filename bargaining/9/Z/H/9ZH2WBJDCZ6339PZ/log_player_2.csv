# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Let's see if we can get a better deal in the next round. While the offer isn't terrible, the inflation will hurt Alice more than me as the game goes on."

# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800

This offer is barely better than her last one, and the inflation is starting to hurt her significantly.  Let's see if she gets more reasonable in the next round."

# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I won't go below this 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is finally feeling the pressure of the inflation, but she's still trying to hold on to a larger share than I think is reasonable.  I'll hold firm for one more round and see if I can get her closer to a 50/50 split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
