"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

This is a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, so I'm looking for a better deal. I'll reject this offer.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation has already reduced the value of the money, I'll aim for a slightly better share this time. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value. Considering the reduced value, I'll think carefully about this offer. Since the numbers are similar to the previous round, and the value of the money is decreasing, I'll accept this offer.
