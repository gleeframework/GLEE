450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, we're running out of time!  I'm proposing a 55/45 split. This is a fair offer considering the rapid inflation impacting your potential gains. Let's close this deal now before the situation worsens for you.",Bob,4,

500000.0,500000.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous! Let's just split it 50/50.  Further negotiations will only hurt both of us. It's time to end this and secure our shares before we both lose more.",Alice,5,
