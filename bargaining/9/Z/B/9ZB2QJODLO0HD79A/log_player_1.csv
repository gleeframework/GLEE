"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```

  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start""
}

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round.
