"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you take 40%""
}
```

This way, I'm taking a slightly larger share, but it's still a relatively even split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script - I'll take 60% this time, and you get 40%.  It's a fair way to start, right? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The tables have turned!

I'll have to think carefully about this new offer. Considering the inflation, I'll have to adjust my calculation.

Since the money is worth 10% less for me, and Bob's offer is 40% of the new total, I'll calculate my gain as follows:

New total: $10,000 / (1 - 0.1) = $9,000 (due to 10% inflation)
My gain: 40% of $9,000 = $3,600

However, I'm not sure if Bob's gain is affected by the same inflation rate (5% less), so I'll assume it's still $6,000.

Considering this, I'll decide to...

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not sure if Bob's gain is affected by the same inflation rate, and I'd like to make a counteroffer to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle and adjust for inflation.""
}
```

I'm taking a slightly smaller share this time, but I'm hoping to find a more agreeable split."
