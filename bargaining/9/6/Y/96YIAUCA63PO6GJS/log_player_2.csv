"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a fair split, considering I'm the one taking the risk of inflation. Let's get this over with! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's a bit too early to accept such a lopsided offer.  While I understand Alice is taking the risk of inflation,  I want to see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to be fair, but I'd like to get a larger share since I'm not taking the risk of inflation. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still taking the bigger risk here. Let's split it closer to 60/40, and we can both walk away with something. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
Alice's offer is more reasonable this time. It's a good compromise, and I'm willing to accept it to avoid further inflation."
