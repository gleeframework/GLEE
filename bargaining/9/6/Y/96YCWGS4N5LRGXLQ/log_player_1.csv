Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. I think a 65/35 split is more reflective of the fact that you lose value faster. Do you accept? 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
