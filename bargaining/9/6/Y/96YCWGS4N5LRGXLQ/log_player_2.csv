Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but 65/35 is too far. Let's split it 60/40. This way, we both have a chance to gain something even with the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000
