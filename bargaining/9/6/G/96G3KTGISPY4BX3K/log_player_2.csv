"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more

# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. While it seems fair on the surface, it's important to consider the inflation factor. With each round, the money will be worth less to both of us, but especially to Alice. If I accept now, I'm essentially losing out on the opportunity to potentially get a better deal later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, taking into account the inflation that's coming. This offer is in your best interest as well, as you'll lose more value with each passing round.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take a bit less than before, but I still think I deserve more. Inflation will hit me harder! 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

I'll accept this offer. Even though the value of the money is decreasing, this is the best deal I've been offered so far. Accepting now ensures I get something, and I'm not sure how much longer Alice will be willing to negotiate."
