"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle. It's a fair deal.""
}
```

I'm proposing that we split the $1,000,000 evenly, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a better deal this time, let's see if you'll take it! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, $300,000 is still a significant amount. However, the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round, so $700,000 is actually equivalent to $666,667 in the first round.

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, considering the decreasing value of the money over time. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a bit aggressive, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's more favorable to me. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a higher share.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""You're trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I'm not falling for it. Let's try a more balanced split.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $800,000 and Bob gets $200,000. This way, I'm taking a larger share, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount of money. Let's see if he'll accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway between my previous offer and the current proposal. Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to find a middle ground!

Let's calculate the equivalent value of the money in the first round. The money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, so $450,000 is still a significant amount. However, the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, so $550,000 is actually equivalent to $472,222 in the first round.

Considering the compromise, I think this offer is more reasonable than Bob's previous offer. I'm willing to accept this offer, as it's a fair split and I'm getting a decent amount of money.
