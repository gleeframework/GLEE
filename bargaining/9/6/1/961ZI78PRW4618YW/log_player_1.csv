"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, see what happens next?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm curious to see what Bob's response will be!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve more since I'm the one making the offer 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation has taken a bite out of my potential earnings!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I think I can do better than a 40/60 split, especially since I'm the one who made the first offer. I'll wait for Bob's next proposal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The game continues!

Considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer, I'll make a new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""You said you deserved more, so I'm giving you a slightly better deal. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a good share and keeping the game going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly worse deal this time, but I'm willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is taking a bigger bite out of my potential earnings, and Bob is pushing for a bigger share.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not comfortable with a 35/65 split, especially since the value of the money is decreasing with each round. I'll wait for Bob's next proposal and try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The game continues!

Considering the increasing inflation and the decreasing value of the money, I'll make a new proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better deal than 35/65. Meet me in the middle?""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still pushing for a slightly better share for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting desperate, but I'll give you a slightly better deal. Take it or leave it 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is really taking its toll now, and Bob is getting more aggressive with his offers.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not comfortable with a 30/70 split, especially since the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. I'm not willing to accept a deal that leaves me with less than 30% of the original value. I'll wait for Bob's next proposal, but I'm not getting my hopes up."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The game continues, but I'm getting worried about the value of the money!

Considering the extreme inflation and the decreasing value of the money, I'll make a new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3600,
  ""bob_gain"": 6400,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to hold on to what's left. Meet me at 36/64?""
}
```

I'm trying to salvage what I can from the rapidly depreciating value of the money. I'm not sure how much longer I can keep going, but I'll try to negotiate one more time."
