"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. Take this good offer while it's still worth something to you. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to try and get a better deal for myself!  Let's see what Alice proposes next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle, Alice. It's a fair deal for both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The value keeps dropping, Bob. This is my final offer - take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While it's not a great deal, it's better than getting nothing. The value is dropping rapidly, and it's unlikely I can get a better offer in the next round."
