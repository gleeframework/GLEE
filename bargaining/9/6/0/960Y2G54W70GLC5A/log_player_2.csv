"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, and we can adjust if needed 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

It's better to see if I can get a better deal in the next round.  Even if Alice's offer is ""fair"", I can try to get more."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'd like to propose a split that favors me slightly, but I'm open to negotiation if you'd prefer something more balanced.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fairer split 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, this offer is closer to what I was looking for in the previous round, and the inflation is starting to bite. It's best to secure a decent share now rather than risk getting nothing."
