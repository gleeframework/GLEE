"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small amount in the first round, hoping he'll be eager to accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not getting the better deal this time! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 20% less, so I need to be more cautious. Bob's offer is a 60/40 split, which is a bit more aggressive than my initial offer. I'll think carefully...

I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money I gain is worth 40% less than in the first round due to inflation. I'll need to be more aggressive in my offer to compensate for the decrease in value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Time to get serious, Bob!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, aren't you? 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really biting! My gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, which means I need to be very careful with my decisions.

Bob's offer is a 70/30 split, which is even more aggressive than his previous offer. I'm not sure if I should take it, but I don't want to risk going into the next round with even less value.

I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 5, the money I gain is worth 61.36% less than in the first round due to inflation. I need to be very cautious and make a strong offer to try to get a good deal.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Time to split it down the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair offer considering the inflation. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game."
