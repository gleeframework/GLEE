"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount, but it's a good starting point. I'm keeping the majority of the money, but it's still a fair offer considering the initial amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of my potential gain is decreasing with each round, so I need to be more aggressive. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better deal.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, and it's still worth 80% of the original value, I'll aim to get a larger share. Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}

I'm offering Bob a smaller amount, but it's still a decent offer considering the decreasing value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of my potential gain is decreasing rapidly. I need to be more aggressive and take a risk to get a better deal. Since Bob's offer is still a relatively good one, I'll accept it to avoid losing more value.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
