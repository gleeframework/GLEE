"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly considering the inflation risk. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Even though Alice's offer is not bad, it's better to try and negotiate a better deal.  Since we don't know how inflation affects Alice, we can try to leverage that uncertainty to get a more favorable outcome for ourselves."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think we should split it closer to 60/40, with me getting 60.  Inflation is a risk for both of us, so I'm willing to share a bit more, but I need to protect my own interests.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, let's aim for a split closer to 60/40, with both of us taking a hit due to the diminishing value of money. 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:** Alice's offer is better than the previous round due to inflation.  Her gain has dropped significantly, showing the impact of inflation on her side.
* **Increased Share:**  Even with the lower value of money, Alice is offering me a slightly larger share than the first round. 
* **Risk Mitigation:**  It's better to accept this offer and secure a reasonable gain than risk further rounds and potentially get nothing.  The value of the money is decreasing with each round, making a riskier approach less appealing."
