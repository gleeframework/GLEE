"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and we can adjust as needed in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fairer, considering we both have a chance to make counter-offers. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about the 55/45 split, especially since it's not as good as my initial offer. I'd like to make a counter-offer and try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 52/48 is a more reasonable split.""}

I'm trying to find a middle ground, taking into account Bob's suggestion of a 55/45 split, but still trying to get a slightly better deal for myself."
