"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

This is a 50-50 split, which seems fair to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation, my gain of $40 is now worth $32.

I'm not thrilled about the uneven split, but I'll consider it. I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 40% less now (20% inflation in each round), my offer will be:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 32,
  ""bob_gain"": 68
}
```

This is a slightly more uneven split, but I'm hoping Bob will accept this time."
