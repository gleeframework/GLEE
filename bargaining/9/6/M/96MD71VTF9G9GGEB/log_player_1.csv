Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a pretty aggressive offer, aiming for a large share of the money. Since the money loses value faster for me, I want to maximize my gain in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer guarantees me a substantial amount. The inflation rate means the money is worth less with each passing round, so it's in my best interest to secure this 500,000 before it loses further value."
