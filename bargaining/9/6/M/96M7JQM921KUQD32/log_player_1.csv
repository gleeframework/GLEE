"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, no need to negotiate too much.""
}
```

I'm offering to give Bob 50% of the money to start, and I'll take the other 50%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 4000, but I think I deserve more since I'm the one making the offer this round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. If I accept, I'll get $4000, which is worth 95% of the original $5000 I could have gotten in Round 1. On the other hand, if I reject and make a counteroffer, I might be able to get more, but I'm not sure if I'll be able to get a better deal later on.

I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer.
