Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your generosity is appreciated, but let's be fair. This is a more balanced offer.  Time is money, even more so for you with the inflation! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
