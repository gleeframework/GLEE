"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the original 100$. This way, I get a larger share, but it's a reasonable starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting the value of the money.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. If I accept, I'll get $20, which is worth 95% of the original $20 from the first round (due to 5% inflation). That's not a bad deal.

On the other hand, Bob's gain of $80 is worth 80% of the original $100 (due to 20% inflation), which is a significant amount.

I'll decide to...
