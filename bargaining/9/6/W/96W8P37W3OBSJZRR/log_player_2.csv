"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair deal. I'm happy to share the majority of the money with you. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While Alice's offer seems fair on the surface, it's important to consider the inflation aspect. Rejecting and making a counter-offer will allow me to gain more of the money before the value depreciates further."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to divide the money, especially considering the inflation factor.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but a 50/50 split isn't fair given the inflation rate affecting you. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Alice's offer is slightly better than her first offer, it still heavily favors her. I'm not willing to accept a deal where I'm getting significantly less than half the money, even considering the inflation. I need to push for a more even split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to get a larger share than 2000 to make this worthwhile. Let's try 4000 for me and 6000 for you. This is closer to a fair split considering inflation.""}
