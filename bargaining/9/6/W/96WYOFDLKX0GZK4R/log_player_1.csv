Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting greedier and taking advantage of my increasingly disadvantaged position.  It's clear he's willing to drag this out. While my situation is worsening, accepting a deal where I get significantly less than a 50/50 split in the later rounds is a bad strategy. I need to push for a fairer split, even if it means reaching the final round."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm offering a 50/50 split. Take it or leave it, but the deal won't get better for you in the next round.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's the final round and the stakes are high. Bob has consistently aimed for a larger share, exploiting the inflation. A 50/50 split is the fairest option at this point. 

* **Urgency:** The ""take it or leave it"" message emphasizes the urgency of the final round.
* **Finality:**  It makes it clear to Bob that there are no further negotiations. This might push him to accept, as he risks getting an even worse deal in the next round (from his perspective). 
* **Fairness Appeal:** Even though the value is significantly diminished for me due to inflation,  a 50/50 split maintains an image of fairness, which might be important for Bob."
