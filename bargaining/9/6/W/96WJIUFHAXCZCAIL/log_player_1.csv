"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a division where I take $5500 and Bob takes $4500, with a message suggesting a relatively fair split but with a slight bias in my favor to initiate negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can find a more equitable split, closer to 50/50. Let's try this. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince Bob has offered a split where I take $4500 and he takes $5500, suggesting a near 50/50 split but with him taking slightly more, I will reject this offer because I initially offered him a better deal which he rejected. I believe we can negotiate further.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlso, considering the inflation, the money is now worth 10% less, but this factor affects both of us equally, so it doesn't directly influence my decision at this point."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nIn this round, I will offer a division where I take $5250 and Bob takes $4750. Considering the inflation, the total value we're dividing is effectively less, but for simplicity, we'll keep the original $10,000 figure in mind for negotiations. My message will acknowledge Bob's desire for a more equitable split but will still aim to secure a slightly larger share for myself, considering my initial offer was more generous to Bob than his counteroffer was to me.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5250, ""bob_gain"": 4750, ""message"": ""Meeting you halfway from my first offer, considering the fairness you sought""}\n\n###\n\nThis approach shows I'm willing to compromise but still value my initial generosity."
