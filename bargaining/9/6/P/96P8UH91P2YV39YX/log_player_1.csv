"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money 4:1, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself, with a message to Bob suggesting that this is a fair starting point for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, I'll have to adjust my calculations.

Since the total amount is now 9,000$, and Bob's offer is to give me 4,000$, I'll calculate the value of 4,000$ in terms of the original 10,000$:

4,000$ is 40% of 10,000$

Now, considering the inflation, I'll accept Bob's offer, but I'll make a counteroffer to try to get more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""I'll take 4,000$, but I'll offer you 3,500$ next time, leaving me with 5,500$""
}
```

Please let me know what happens next!"
