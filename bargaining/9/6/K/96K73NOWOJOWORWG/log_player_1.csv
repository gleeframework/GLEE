"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. The message is a friendly invitation to accept the offer and end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering the inflation. Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of $4,500 is worth 5% less than the $6,000 I proposed earlier, which is $5,700. And Bob's gain of $5,500 is worth 10% less than the $4,000 he proposed, which is $3,600.

Considering this, I think Bob's revised offer is a bit more favorable to him than my initial proposal. However, I still think it's a reasonable compromise, especially since it's a 55-45 split.

I accept Bob's offer.
