"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $600,000, and leave $400,000 for Bob. My message is a friendly one, suggesting a fair and balanced split to get the game started."

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 5% inflation, my $600,000 is now worth $570,000. Bob's offer is a significant decrease in my share, but I'll consider it.

}
```

I'm offering to take 55% of the remaining $1,000,000, which is $550,000, and leave $450,000 for Bob. My message is a friendly one, suggesting a compromise that's close to the previous offer, but with a slight concession."
