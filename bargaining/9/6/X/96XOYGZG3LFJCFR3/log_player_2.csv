"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm not going to accept this offer. It's a good starting point, but there's a lot of room for negotiation. I want to see if Alice is willing to be more equitable, especially given the inflation factor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000}
``` 

I'm offering Alice a slightly larger share, but I'm also trying to secure a good amount for myself. Since the money is worth less each round, I need to be more assertive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I would like to get more, Alice is clearly not willing to budge much. Accepting this offer ensures I get something, and given the inflation, taking a smaller share now might be better than risking getting nothing later."
