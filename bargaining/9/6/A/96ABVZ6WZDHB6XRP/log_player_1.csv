"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'll offer Bob $100,000 and keep $900,000 for myself. I figure this is a fair starting point, giving Bob a small share to incentivize him to accept, while still leaving me with the majority.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred to keep more, I understand Bob's position. The money is losing value fast, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all. Accepting this offer secures me some money, albeit less than my initial proposal."
