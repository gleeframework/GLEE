Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bit more 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of inflation more than Bob.  While her offers have come down, they are still tilted in her favor considering the money is losing value faster for her. It's worth holding out a bit longer to see if Bob can secure an even better deal."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time and the pot is shrinking. This is a fair split considering the circumstances. Let's close the deal and both get something!""}
```

**Reasoning:**

- **Time pressure:**  With only 6 rounds left, the pressure is on. It's crucial to reach an agreement soon.
- **Diminishing returns:**  Every round makes the potential gains smaller for both sides.
- **Fairness:**  While Bob has been holding out for a better deal, this offer leans towards fairness given the time constraint and Alice's disadvantage with the inflation rate.  

By highlighting the urgency and offering a reasonable split, Bob increases the chances of Alice accepting and avoiding a disastrous outcome where they both get nothing."
