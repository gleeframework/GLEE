"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being generous, Bob. Take it or leave it! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While Alice's offer seems tempting, I want to see if I can get a better deal for myself.  Rejecting gives me a chance to propose in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly. I'm willing to take a bit less, hoping for a smooth agreement.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This time, I'm offering a fair compromise.  Let's end this before things get worse for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still hoping for a better deal.  Even though the money is worth less now, I want to see if I can get closer to a 50/50 split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm feeling generous, Alice. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us. I'm willing to take a little less, but I think it's important to share the wealth.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm taking a slight loss, Bob.  Let's meet in the middle and avoid further losses due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I still prefer a 50/50 split, the inflation is taking a toll, and my potential gains are significantly lower. Accepting this offer gives me a decent amount of money, and it's better than potentially losing everything in the later rounds."
