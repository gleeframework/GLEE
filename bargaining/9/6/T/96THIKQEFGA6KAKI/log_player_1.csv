Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it a little closer to the middle. I propose 550k for me, 450k for you.  We both get a good chunk and we avoid the risk of losing more to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000
