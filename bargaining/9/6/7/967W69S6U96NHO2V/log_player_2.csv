Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out! This is my final offer - take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI've considered the inflation rates and Alice's message. Since the money is worth less with each passing round, I think it's time to accept the offer.\n\n###\n\nMy response: {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI'm willing to take the 450,000, considering the decreasing value of the money.\n\n###\n\nLet's end the game here.\n\n###\n\nIt was a good game, Alice! Thanks for playing.\n\n###\n\n(No need to proceed to the next round, as I've accepted the offer.)\n\n###\n\nGame over!"
