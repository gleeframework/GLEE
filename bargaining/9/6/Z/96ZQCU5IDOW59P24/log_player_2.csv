Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want this money. I'm offering you a significant sum, but inflation is a real threat. Let's settle this now. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Take this offer! Every round is costing us both money due to inflation. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, the risk of further inflation is too great. This offer, while not ideal,  at least secures a decent amount and avoids the potential of losing even more in subsequent rounds."
