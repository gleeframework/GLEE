"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm starting with a fairly generous offer, hoping to secure a quick agreement. I figure Bob might be tempted to take a smaller share now, rather than risk getting nothing in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is worse than my previous offer, considering inflation. I'll reject and try to secure a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but still keeping it at a point where Bob is getting a significant share. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not going to cave to his demands.  I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in reaching an agreement before the inflation eats away at the money even further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is becoming increasingly unfair, considering the inflation. I'll continue to reject his proposals and hope to reach a more equitable agreement in the later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but still keeping it at a level where Bob is getting a reasonable share. I'm hoping that Bob will realize that if he keeps rejecting my offers, we'll both end up with nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting even worse, especially considering the inflation. I'm still holding out for a fairer deal. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for such a lopsided split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of the inflation. I'm hoping that Bob will realize that we're both losing money with each passing round."
