Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I want a bigger share since the money is worth less to me with each passing round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Let's see why rejecting is a good strategy here.

**Reasoning:**

* **Future Leverage:** While Bob is right that the money is worth less to him over time, you rejecting his offer puts pressure on him. He loses even more value in the next round.
* **Your Turn Next:** By rejecting, you get to make the proposal in the next round. This gives you a strong negotiating position.
* **Aim Higher:** You initially proposed a fair 60/40 split.  Given the inflation working in your favor, you should aim for an even better outcome in subsequent rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 7000,
""bob_gain"": 3000,
""message"": ""Time is money, Bob. Let's make a deal. This is my final offer.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increased Pressure:**  Bob's money is now worth significantly less. This round, he's lost another 20% of value on his potential gains. 
* **Strategic Urgency:** By stating this is your final offer, you add a layer of urgency and signal that you are firm in your position.
* **Strong Position:** While 70/30 is a significant split in your favor, the rapidly decreasing value for Bob makes it a reasonable proposition for him to accept."
