"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly, Bob. I'm willing to give you a decent share.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the original amount, which is a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, but I'm willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is already hitting me hard!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully. If I accept this offer, I'll get 30% of the original amount, which is a significant reduction from the 60% I initially proposed.

After some thought, I'll reject this offer. I'm not willing to give up 70% of the original amount.

```

This time, I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but still trying to maintain a decent amount for myself."

After some thought, I'll reject this offer. I'm not willing to give up 60% of the original amount, even with the reduced value due to inflation.
