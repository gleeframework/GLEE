"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm going to reject this offer. I'm aware of the inflation, and while Alice's offer is tempting, I think I can get a better deal for myself. I'll try to negotiate a more favorable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6500,
""alice_gain"": 3500,
""message"": ""Let's flip the script. I propose a 65-35 split in my favor. It's a fairer deal considering the inflation affects us differently.  What do you say?""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise. 48-52 split, let's meet in the middle! 
# Bob gain: 5200 
# Alice gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Alice's offer is reasonable, considering the inflation and the fact that I rejected her previous offer. A 52-48 split in my favor is a good outcome, and I'm happy to accept it."
