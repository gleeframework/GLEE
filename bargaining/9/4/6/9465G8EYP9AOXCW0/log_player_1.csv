"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $1,000,000 equally, with each of us getting $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the lion's share this time, but we can discuss a more even split later. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob taking the lion's share, but I'll consider it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm still willing to compromise""}

I'm proposing that I get $750,000 and Bob gets $250,000. I'm trying to find a middle ground that's more favorable to me, but still allows Bob to get a decent share."
