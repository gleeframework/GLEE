"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair and reasonable starting point. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject the offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a better deal this time, but you have to think fast! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new values, I'll have to think carefully.

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll try to get a better deal. Bob's offer is a 60/40 split, which is not as good as my initial 50/50 proposal. However, it's still a decent offer considering the reduced value of the money.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth even less due to inflation, I'll aim for an even better deal. I'll try to get a slightly higher percentage.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not getting taken advantage of!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42/58 split, which is a bit more favorable to me, considering the reduced value of the money. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject this offer!"
