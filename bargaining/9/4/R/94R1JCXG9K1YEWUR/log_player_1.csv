Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor. It's a fairly aggressive opening, but I want to see if Bob is willing to negotiate.  If he rejects, I'll need to adjust my strategy for the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being very aggressive here. While 10% is less than what I offered in the first round, it's still a significant amount.  I'm not willing to accept such a drastically unfair split, especially with inflation kicking in. I'll counter with a more balanced offer next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm going to offer a 60/40 split in my favor.  This is a more balanced approach that hopefully addresses Bob's desire for a larger share while still giving me a decent gain. I need to find a compromise to avoid losing even more money due to inflation."
