Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time and the clock is working against both of us. I'm sticking to a split that favors me slightly due to the inflation disparity. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800

Reasoning:

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in Round 5 is the most logical choice at this point. 

* **Time pressure:** With only 7 rounds remaining, the value of the money is rapidly decreasing for both players. Delaying further significantly increases the risk of walking away with nothing.
* **Inflation disparity:**  The inflation is hitting Bob harder than Alice. Waiting it out favors Alice more than Bob.
* **Diminishing returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might not lead to a significantly better offer from Alice. She seems set on a split that favors her, and future offers might be even less favorable than the current one.

Taking these factors into account, accepting the current offer, although not ideal, mitigates potential losses and secures a reasonable sum considering the circumstances.
