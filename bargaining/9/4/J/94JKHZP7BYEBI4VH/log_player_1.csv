I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor. I figure it's a good starting point, and Bob might be willing to accept it to avoid risking getting nothing in the later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject this offer. Bob is being greedy, but I'm confident that I can get a better deal in the future rounds. I'm still willing to negotiate, but I won't be taken advantage of."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split.  This is a fair and equitable division, and I believe it's in both of our best interests to reach an agreement.  Let's be reasonable and avoid further rounds of haggling."
