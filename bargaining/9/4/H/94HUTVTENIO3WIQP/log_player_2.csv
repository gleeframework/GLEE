"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money fairly. I'm offering you 40% and I'll take 60%. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. The current offer doesn't seem fair to me, and I think I can get a better deal. Plus, the inflation rate is higher for me, so I'm more motivated to get a good deal sooner rather than later. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think 55% for me is a more reasonable split, considering I'm losing more value each round.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's split it 55/45, with me taking 55%. This is a good deal for both of us, considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlthough Alice is meeting me halfway, I still think I can get a better deal. The inflation rate is still higher for me, so I'm more motivated to get a good deal sooner rather than later. Let's see what happens in the next round! I'll try to make a counteroffer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think 60% for me is a fair split. The money is losing value fast for me, so I need to get a good deal quickly.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split this evenly. The inflation is hurting us both, and I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to move forward. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on my potential gain, I think accepting the 50/50 split is the best decision. The money is losing value rapidly for me, and further negotiations may lead to even less valuable outcomes. Accepting this offer ensures that I get a reasonable share of the money before its value drops even more."
