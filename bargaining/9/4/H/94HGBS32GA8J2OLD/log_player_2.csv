**Reasoning:**

While Alice is slowly moving towards a more even split, it's still heavily in her favor considering the rapid devaluation of the money. It's time to play hardball.  We need to signal that we're willing to risk it all to get a fairer share.  The longer this goes on, the worse it is for both of us, but especially for Alice."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. Accept this offer now, or we both lose big. Don't be greedy.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This offer is a calculated gamble.  It's a significant jump in my favor, but it's designed to be a wake-up call for Alice. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:**  We're past the halfway point, and the value is plummeting. Every round wasted is a significant loss for both of us.
* **Exploiting Alice's Loss Aversion:** Alice is losing money at a faster rate than I am. By now, she should be feeling the pressure. This offer highlights her potential loss if she continues to be stubborn.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this offer is aggressive, it still leaves room for Alice to counter with something more acceptable to both of us in the next round, should she refuse.

This is a high-stakes play, but the situation demands bold action."
