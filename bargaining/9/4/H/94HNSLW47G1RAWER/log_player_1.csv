"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 30, and I'll take 70. It's a good starting point, don't you think?""
}
```

Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can find a fairer split. I'll take 45, and you can have 55. This way, we both get a decent amount and avoid any further losses from inflation. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gain, I'd rather not accept this offer. I'd like to try to get a bit more. 

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation is affecting my gain more severely, I'll aim for a higher share. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation. I'll give you 40, but I'll take 60. It's a fairer split, don't you think?""
}
