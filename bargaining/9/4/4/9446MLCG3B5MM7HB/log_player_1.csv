"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
``` 

This offer gives me the majority (90%) of the money, while ensuring Bob gets something and might be more likely to accept.  It also leaves room for negotiation in the next round if Bob rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob's offer is worse than my initial offer, and I don't want to accept it.  I'll try to get a better deal in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000} 
``` 

I'm lowering my share slightly to see if Bob will accept. I'm still aiming for a large share, but I'm acknowledging that the money is losing value, and I want to reach an agreement before the inflation hits too hard."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is worse than my previous offer, even accounting for the inflation.  I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share, but I'm not going to settle for such a low amount."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000} 
```

I'm lowering my share again, but still trying to secure the majority of the money. We're nearing the middle of the game, and the inflation is hitting harder. I need to find a balance between securing a decent share and avoiding a stalemate."

# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is worse than my previous offer, even accounting for the inflation. I'm not willing to accept such a small share, especially since we're approaching the halfway point of the game and the stakes are increasing. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
```

I'm lowering my share again, but still trying to secure a majority of the money. The inflation is hitting hard, but I believe a 60/40 split is a reasonable compromise, especially given that I've been making concessions throughout the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000} 
```

With the inflation hitting hard, and only a few rounds left, I need to find a compromise. A 50/50 split is the fairest solution, given the significant loss in value for both of us. It's time to be pragmatic and secure something rather than risk losing everything."
