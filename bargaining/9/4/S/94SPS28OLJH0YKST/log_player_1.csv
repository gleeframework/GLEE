"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can finalize the deal.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 ratio, which seems reasonable for a starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but still a fair split. Your turn to decide! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, the money is worth less, so I'll have to be more cautious. However, Bob's offer is still quite generous, considering the ratio is 2:3. I'll accept this offer to avoid losing even more value in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
