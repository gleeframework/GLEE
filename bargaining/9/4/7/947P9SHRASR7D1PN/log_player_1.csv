Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nLet's continue to the next round. I'll make a new proposal. \n{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Come on, Bob, be generous""}\n\n###"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nSince I've already made my new proposal in the previous response, I'll just repeat it here for clarity:\n{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Come on, Bob, be generous""}\n\n###"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nLet's continue to the next round. I'll make a new proposal. \n{""alice_gain"": 56, ""bob_gain"": 44, ""message"": ""Getting closer, but not there yet""}\n\n###\n\nNote: Since Bob's offer has increased from the previous round, and given the impact of inflation on Bob's gain, it seems reasonable to continue negotiating for a better share. The new proposal aims to capture a bit more value while still being mindful of the need for compromise."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since I've already made my new proposal in the previous response, I'll just repeat it here for clarity:\n{""alice_gain"": 56, ""bob_gain"": 44, ""message"": ""Getting closer, but not there yet""}\n\n###"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, it's the fairest deal 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nGiven the current state of inflation and the offers made so far, accepting Bob's offer of an equal split seems reasonable. Since the money I gain retains its full value, while Bob's share is worth significantly less due to inflation, this 50-50 split actually favors me more than the numbers might initially suggest. Continuing to negotiate might risk Bob becoming unwilling to compromise further, so accepting this offer appears to be the most advantageous decision at this point."
