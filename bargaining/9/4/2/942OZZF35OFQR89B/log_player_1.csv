"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start, no need to negotiate too hard.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to begin with, to see if Bob is interested in accepting or not."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair start 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, the actual amounts I would gain in this round are:

* My gain: 3000 * 0.9 (10% less due to inflation) = 2700
* Bob's gain: 7000 * 0.8 (20% less due to inflation) = 5600

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, but I'll consider it. I'll reject this offer for now.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth less with each round, I'll aim for a slightly higher percentage of the remaining amount.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a bit more, but I'm willing to compromise.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much ground 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts considering the inflation effect:

* My gain: 4000 * 0.723 (1 - 0.277, 27.1% less due to inflation) = 2892
* Bob's gain: 6000 * 0.516 (1 - 0.484, 48.8% less due to inflation) = 3096

This offer is actually slightly worse for me than the previous one, considering the inflation effect. I'll reject this offer.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth even less with each round, I'll aim for an even higher percentage of the remaining amount.

```

  ""alice_gain"": 4600,
  ""bob_gain"": 5400,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need a better deal for myself.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not giving up, I think this is a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts considering the inflation effect:

* My gain: 4500 * 0.592 (1 - 0.408, 40.95% less due to inflation) = 2664
* Bob's gain: 5500 * 0.326 (1 - 0.673, 67.23% less due to inflation) = 1793

This offer is actually quite low for me, considering the inflation effect. I'll reject this offer.
