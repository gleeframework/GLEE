"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and end the game quickly.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to see if Bob accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but still a decent deal 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I'll have to be cautious. Since the money is worth 10% less for me, and Bob's offer is 4000, that's equivalent to 4500 in the first round. Not bad, but I can do better.

I'll reject Bob's offer and propose my next move.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but still a decent deal, and I'll give myself 4500. I'll give you 5500.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less again, I'll have to adjust my proposal accordingly. Considering the previous offer from Bob, I'll aim to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give you the majority.""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll try to get a better deal, but I'm not going to give you too much 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings. Considering the offer from Bob, I'll have to be careful. The 3000 I'd gain is equivalent to 3600 in the first round, which is a significant decrease.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a bit too low for me. I'll give you 3200, and I'll take 6800.""

{
  ""alice_gain"": 3400,
  ""bob_gain"": 6600,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet in the middle, but I'm not going to give you the majority.""
}
