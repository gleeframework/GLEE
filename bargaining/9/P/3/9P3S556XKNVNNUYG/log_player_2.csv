"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob.  Let's split it 90/10.  I'm sure you'll appreciate my fairness. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 9000, ""alice_gain"": 1000, ""message"": ""Alice, your offer was generous, but I think we can do better. Let's split it 90/10, with me taking the larger share this time. It's only fair, since I have to deal with the 20% inflation each round.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, let's split it 60/40.  I think this is fair, given the inflation and the fact that we're both getting less with each round.  Let's get this done. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

Even with the inflation, accepting 4000 is better than the 3600 I'd get if I reject and have to wait for the next round."
