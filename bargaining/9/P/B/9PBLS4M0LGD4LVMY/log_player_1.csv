"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}

I'm offering you $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. It's a fair starting point, don't you think?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting twist!

Since the money is worth less after inflation, I'll have to adjust my decision accordingly. Given that the offer is the same as mine in the first round, I'll reject it as well.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000
}

I'm offering you a slightly larger share this time, hoping you'll accept!"
