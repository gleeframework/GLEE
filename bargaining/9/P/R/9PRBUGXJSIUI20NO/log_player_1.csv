"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll start with 60-40""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the original $100, and Bob will get 40%. This is a fair split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60-40 is a more balanced split, since we are both starting out. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less in the second round, my gain of 40 is actually worth $36 (40 * 0.9).

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this offer, especially since Bob's gain is still worth the same as in the first round. I'd like to try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less again, my gain of $36 is now worth $32.40 (36 * 0.9).

I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal.

  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you in the middle, 50-50, let's end it here""
