Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting us nowhere.  I'm willing to compromise, but we need to be realistic about the time pressure. Let's close this deal now -  55/45 split, and we both benefit from avoiding further inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500
