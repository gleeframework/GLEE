"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer ensures we both benefit. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 524375,
""alice_gain"": 475625,
""message"": ""Alice, I understand you want to be fair, but inflation hurts me more than you. Let's make a deal that accounts for that.""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Alice's offer:** Alice's initial offer heavily favored her. It made sense to reject it, hoping she'd offer something better in later rounds due to the faster inflation on Bob's side.
* **Bob's counter-offer:**  This offer is still slightly advantageous to Alice but recognizes the impact of inflation. It aims to entice her to accept to avoid further losses for both of them as the game progresses."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both lose with these tactics. Let's split it evenly and end this. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Explanation:**

While a 50/50 split wasn't ideal in the first round,  the impact of inflation is becoming increasingly significant. Accepting a fair offer now prevents further losses for Bob in future rounds."
