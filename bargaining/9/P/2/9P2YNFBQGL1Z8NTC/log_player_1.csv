Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}

With only two rounds left, I'm willing to risk it all and go back to my offer from round 7.  The inflation is severe, but Bob's offers are getting incredibly unreasonable. I'm hoping that he realizes that continuing to reject will leave both of us with nothing."

Even though the inflation has made the money worth very little for me, I'm still going to reject this offer.  Bob's offers have been consistently unfair, and I'm not going to accept such a small share.  It's better to walk away with nothing than to accept such an insulting offer."
