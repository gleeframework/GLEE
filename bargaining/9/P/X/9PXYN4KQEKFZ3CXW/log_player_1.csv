"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose Alice gets $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000. This gives me a significant portion of the money, but also leaves Bob with something. I believe this is a fair starting point, and hopefully, he will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Although my share is significantly less than the initial proposal, it's still a substantial amount of money, and the decrease in value due to inflation is not enough to warrant risking another round.  I'll accept Bob's offer."
