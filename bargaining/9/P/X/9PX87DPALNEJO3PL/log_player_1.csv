"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 

This is my initial offer. I'm taking a large portion, but I want to see if Bob is willing to accept something small to get something at all. It's a risky strategy, but I'm hoping to get a good deal early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While this is a significant loss from my initial offer, I'm not willing to accept such a drastically unequal division this early in the game. I'm hoping that by rejecting, Bob will be more willing to negotiate in the future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm lowering my proposed share, but still aiming for a majority. I think Bob might be more willing to compromise after his last offer was rejected."
