"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
This seems like a fair starting point. I'm aiming for the majority of the money, but I'm not being greedy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject this offer.  While it's a more even split, my share is significantly reduced by inflation, and I'm confident I can do better."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but I'm still aiming for a larger share.  Bob rejected my previous offer, so I need to be more flexible, but I'm not willing to accept a 50/50 split with the inflation penalty."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is far too low.  Inflation has significantly reduced the value of my share, and I'm still confident I can get a better deal.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for such a small share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm dropping my offer again, acknowledging the inflation and Bob's resistance. However, I'm still hoping for a larger share, as a 70/30 split is more favorable to me in the long run."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, even with the inflation impacting my share.  I'm going to hold out for a better deal.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to see a more significant increase in my share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm making one final attempt to secure a decent share. I'm lowering my offer to a 60/40 split, hoping Bob will realize that we're nearing the end of the game and further rejections will likely lead to a worse outcome for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is far too low.  Even though I'm losing a significant amount due to inflation, I'm not going to settle for such a small share.  I'm willing to risk getting nothing at all to see if I can get a better deal in the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split. With the game nearing its end and inflation heavily impacting my share, I believe this is the best option to ensure I get something.  I'm willing to compromise to avoid getting nothing."
