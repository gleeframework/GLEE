"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous. Let's start with a fair split, but we can adjust in future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a very uneven split, and while I appreciate the offer to adjust in future rounds, I'm confident I can secure a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Let's be realistic, Alice. I'm willing to give you a significant portion, but this needs to be more balanced.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need more than 4000. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is starting to move in the right direction, but this is still not favorable enough. The inflation is hurting me more than it is her, so I need to push for a better deal while I still have some leverage."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Time is running out, Alice.  This is a compromise I think we can both live with.""
