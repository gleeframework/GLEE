"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money 60/40. It's a fair deal that gives us both a good share. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","### Bot Response\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n### Reasoning\nSince I'm Bob, I want to get the best possible deal. In this case, Alice is offering me 40 dollars, which is less than half of the total amount. I think I can do better than that. By rejecting this offer, I'll get the chance to make a counteroffer in the next round and try to get a bigger share of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","### Bot Response\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think we should split it 55/45. This way, I get a bit more, but you still get a significant share.""}\n\n### Reasoning\nSince I rejected Alice's offer in the previous round, now it's my turn to make an offer. I want to make a deal that is more favorable to me, but still reasonable for Alice. By offering 55 dollars for myself and 45 dollars for Alice, I'm hoping she'll see it as a fair compromise and accept it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want a larger share.  How about we meet in the middle at 55/45, with me getting the slightly larger portion? 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","### Bot Response\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n### Reasoning\nIn this round, Alice is offering a 55/45 split, but with her getting the larger portion. Since I previously offered the same split but with me getting the larger portion, and she rejected it, I realize we're at a stalemate. To avoid further back-and-forth, I'm willing to accept her offer, as it's still a relatively fair deal and I don't want to risk getting an even worse offer in the next round. By accepting, I'm guaranteed to get 45 dollars, which is better than taking a chance on an uncertain outcome in future rounds."
