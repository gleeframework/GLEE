Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept and we can both get a good chunk of the money. I want to see if he's willing to accept a smaller share for a quicker payout.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a much fairer offer.  Since the money is worth less in the next round, I'll accept Bob's offer and we'll each get a good amount."
