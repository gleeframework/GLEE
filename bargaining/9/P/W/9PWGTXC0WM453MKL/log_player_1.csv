"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

This is a straightforward proposal where we both get equal halves of the $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have a smaller share, but I'll still give you a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making a decision.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure I want to accept a deal where I get only 30% of the total amount, while Bob gets 70%. I'll try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""You can't do better than this, take it or leave it!""
}
```

This time, I'm offering Bob a smaller share, 40%, while I'll take 60% of the total amount. It's a tougher offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, but I'm still willing to make a deal! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to squeeze me out!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

No way! I'm not accepting an offer where I get only 20% of the total amount. That's not even close to a fair deal. I'll keep negotiating for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer, but not too extreme.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not getting desperate, but I'm getting serious. This is my best offer so far!""
}
```

This time, I'm offering Bob a 45% share, while I'll take 55% of the total amount. It's a bit more generous than my previous offer, but still a good deal for me. Let's see if Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving you 90% of the money, but I'm willing to compromise! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, that's a very one-sided offer!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

No way! I'm not accepting an offer where I get only 10% of the total amount. That's completely unfair. I'll keep pushing for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer, but still reasonable.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not backing down, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

This time, I'm offering Bob a 30% share, while I'll take 70% of the total amount. It's a tough offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can finally settle this."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting close to walking away with nothing, don't make me do that! 
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","That's a very lowball offer!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

No way! I'm not accepting an offer where I get only 5% of the total amount. That's an insult. I'll keep pushing for a better deal, even if it means we go to the final rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a final, strong offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""This is my last offer. Take it, or we both walk away with nothing!""
}
```

This time, I'm offering Bob a 20% share, while I'll take 80% of the total amount. It's a tough offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can finally settle this."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're really going to let it slip away? I'm making one final offer! 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","That's an extremely low offer!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

Are you kidding me? $1000 for me? That's an insult. I'm not accepting this offer, and I'm starting to think Bob is just trying to waste my time. I'll make one last offer to try to salvage something."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a final, desperate offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""This is my absolute final offer. Take it, or we both lose everything!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 10% share, while I'll take 90% of the total amount. It's a huge concession on my part, but I'm hoping Bob will see that it's the best he's going to get and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Fine, you want to play it this way? I'll take the last 100 dollars and leave you with nothing! 
# Alice gain: 100 
# Bob gain: 999900 
Do you accept this offer?","That's a ridiculous offer!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd rather walk away with nothing than accept an offer where I get $100 and Bob gets the rest. That's not a division of the money, that's a robbery! I'm not going to let Bob get away with this."
