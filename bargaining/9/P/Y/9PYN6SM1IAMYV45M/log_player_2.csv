"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I hope you agree. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the initial split seems unfair, the inflation heavily favors Bob in this scenario. It's in Bob's best interest to drag out the game, making Alice's offers less and less appealing to her as time goes on."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Your share will shrink much faster than mine, Alice. I'm feeling generous today.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This offer flips the script on Alice, offering her a smaller share while reminding her of the rapidly depreciating value of her potential gains. By taking a bold stance early, Bob aims to demonstrate his advantage and potentially pressure Alice into accepting a less favorable deal in later rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable and split the money evenly.  This way, we both get something, and we avoid risking further losses due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation, now offering an even split.  While this is tempting, Bob is still in a strong position. Each round that passes gives him a larger and larger advantage due to the difference in inflation rates. Patience is key."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6500,
""alice_gain"": 3500,
""message"": ""The clock is ticking, Alice.  Every round makes this less appealing for you.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob maintains a firm stance, increasing his demand slightly to exploit Alice's increasingly desperate position. The message continues to highlight the disadvantageous impact of inflation on Alice's potential earnings, aiming to nudge her towards acceptance."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to take a slight loss to avoid further inflation. This is my final offer before the situation gets even worse for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 6000 
# Alice gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is returning to her initial offer, but now the impact of inflation is significant. While Bob could likely push for more in the next round or two, there's a risk that Alice might start making even lower offers out of desperation. Accepting now secures a reasonable gain for Bob while ensuring they both get something before inflation eats away at the value further."
