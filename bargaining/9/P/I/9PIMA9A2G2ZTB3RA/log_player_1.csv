"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

This is a 50-50 split, which seems fair to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, my gain of 400,000 is worth 95% of the original 500,000, which is 380,000. Bob's gain of 600,000 is worth 90% of the original 500,000, which is 450,000.

This offer seems to favor Bob slightly, but I'll consider it. I'll reject it for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In round 3, the money is worth 95% of its original value due to inflation. My offer is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}
```

This is a slightly more skewed offer, with me getting a larger share to compensate for the effects of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation:

My gain of 300,000 is worth 85.74% of the original 500,000, which is 427,700.
Bob's gain of 700,000 is worth 73.9% of the original 500,000, which is 368,500.

This offer seems to be a significant concession from Bob, and I think it's a good opportunity to accept.
