"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 40%. I'm framing it as a fair starting point, hoping Bob will accept and we can move on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can split this more fairly. Let's go 60-40, my way! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to turn the tables on me!

I'll reject Bob's offer, since it's the same offer I made in Round 1, and I'm not willing to accept it again. I'll try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not again! I'm not going to accept a 60-40 split. I'll make a new offer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round due to inflation, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. I'll offer a slightly higher percentage to Bob, hoping he'll accept.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Compromise is key! I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need some assurance it's worth it.""
}
```"
