I'm going for a slightly unfair but hopefully agreeable starting point. Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 85 
# Bob gain: 15 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is getting greedy! I'm not going to accept that offer. I'll make a counter-proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 88, ""bob_gain"": 12}
```

I'm going to slightly increase my proposed share to entice Bob, but still maintain a majority. Let's see if he's willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Okay, Bob's getting more aggressive, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of the dwindling value of the money. I'll accept this offer."
