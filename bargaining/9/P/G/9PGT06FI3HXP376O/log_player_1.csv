I'm starting with a generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept it and we can both get a good share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm not happy with Bob's offer. It's way too low for me, and I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but still giving Bob a significant share.  I hope he'll see that it's better to accept this than risk another round with even higher inflation."
