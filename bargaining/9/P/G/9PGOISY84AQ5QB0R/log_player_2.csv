"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try to compromise. I'm willing to give up some more, but I need to get a better deal than your last offer. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting better, but it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  The inflation is hitting her much harder than me.  I need to hold out for a more equitable split, knowing that each round makes her current offer less appealing to her."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is a fair compromise. It acknowledges the shrinking pot and gives us both a reasonable share.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from Round 2 to show willingness to compromise, but I'm still aiming for a larger share. The significant inflation on Alice's side means she'll be increasingly motivated to reach a deal soon."
