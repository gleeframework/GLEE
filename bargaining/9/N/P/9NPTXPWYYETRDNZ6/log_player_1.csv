"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can finish the game quickly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $250,000 and keeping $750,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly.  This way we both get something. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking its toll.

I'm not sure I want to split it evenly, but I don't want to give Bob too much either. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for the next round and try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```

  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not willing to give up too much. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 this time, and keeping $600,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a little more, but I still think we should be close to a 50/50 split. Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings.

I'm not thrilled about the 55/45 split, but I don't want to wait for another round and risk losing even more value. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the offer and end the game."
