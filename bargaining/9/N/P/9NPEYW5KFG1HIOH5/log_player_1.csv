"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point!""
}

I'm proposing that I get $400,000 and Bob gets $600,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. This offer is more equitable and still leaves a good amount for you. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the reduced value of my potential gain due to inflation, but I'll consider Bob's offer.

After re-evaluating, I think I can accept this offer. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
