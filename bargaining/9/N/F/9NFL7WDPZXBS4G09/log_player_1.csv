I'm starting with a pretty lopsided offer, but I figure it's better to be greedy early on and see if Bob is willing to accept.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being pretty greedy! I'm going to reject this offer and see if we can reach a more equitable agreement in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55} 
```

I'm going to try a more balanced approach this time.  I'm willing to give Bob a bit more, but I'm not going to let him take everything.  Hopefully, this will lead to a faster resolution."
