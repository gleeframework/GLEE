Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're both losing value, but I'm losing more. I think this split is more reasonable, considering the current state of inflation. It's getting costly to keep negotiating. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Rapidly Declining Value:** With each round, the money loses value significantly.  Accepting $40 now is better than risking even less in a potential Round 5.
* **Bob's Increasing Losses:**  Bob's losses are proportionally higher than Alice's.  He's likely feeling the pressure and is unlikely to offer anything significantly better in the next round. 
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  The longer the negotiation drags on, the less value is left for both parties.  

In short, accepting a less-than-ideal offer now avoids the risk of an even worse outcome later."
