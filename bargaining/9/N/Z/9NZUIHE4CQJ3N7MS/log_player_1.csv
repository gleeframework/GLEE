We are getting close to the point where Bob's impatience is more valuable than the decreasing value of the money.  I'm hoping he'll become more reasonable soon, but I'm willing to push him a bit further."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical solution. Don't let greed make us both losers. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 

While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this point is the safest option.  Bob is clearly getting impatient and the value of the money is decreasing significantly for both of us with each round.  It's better to secure a guaranteed win than to risk getting nothing at all."
