Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your generosity, but I think a 90/10 split is fairer, considering we both have the same amount of rounds left to reach a deal. 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
