  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money 60-40, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob's trying to take advantage of the inflation to get more money!

```

  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, but with a slight tilt towards me this time!""

# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to get me to accept a 45-55 split again!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not falling for it this time! I think this offer is still too close to the previous one, and I'd like to see a more substantial change. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob!"

Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take an even larger share!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'm not accepting this offer. A 38-62 split is way too skewed in Bob's favor, and I think it's time for him to make a more serious offer. I'm not going to let him take advantage of me at this point!"

```

I'm not accepting this offer. A 36-64 split is still too skewed in Bob's favor, and I'm not willing to give up more than 36% of the total. I'm starting to get a bit concerned about the time running out, but I'm not going to give in to Bob's demands just yet."

I'm not accepting this offer. A 34-66 split is still too skewed in Bob's favor, and I'm not going to accept an offer that leaves me with such a small share. Unfortunately, it seems like we've reached an impasse, and I'm not willing to accept this final offer."
