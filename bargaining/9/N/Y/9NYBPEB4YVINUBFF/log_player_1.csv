"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a good deal, but I want more! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is biting!

Considering the offer, I'll have to weigh the benefits. If I accept, I'll get $300,000, which is worth 60% of what I would have gotten in the first round. On the other hand, Bob's gain is worth 70% of what he would have gotten in the first round.

My decision is:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3

  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""bob_gain"": 600000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not getting taken advantage of!""
}
```

I'm trying to be generous, but not too generous, considering the inflation effect."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really biting now!

Considering the offer, I'll have to think carefully. If I accept, I'll get $100,000, which is worth only 10% of what I would have gotten in the first round. It's a tough pill to swallow.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
