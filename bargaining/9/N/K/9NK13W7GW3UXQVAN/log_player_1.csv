"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you 40% of the initial amount.""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob 40 dollars, which is 40% of the initial 100 dollars. I'm keeping 60 dollars, which is 60% of the initial amount."
