"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $10,000, which is $8,000, and Bob gets the remaining $2,000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering I'm the one making the first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it closer to even, I think 5500 for me and 4500 for you is a good starting point. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it.

After recalculating the offer in my head, I realize that it's not a bad deal, considering the inflation rates. I'll accept Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
