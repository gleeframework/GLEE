"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. I'm being generous, but I'm also trying to get a good chunk of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that. Let's try a 55/45 split. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is already affecting me!

Considering the 20% decrease in value, my gain of $4500 is equivalent to $3600 in the first round. That's a decent offer, but I'm not sure if I want to settle for that. I'd like to get a bit more.

I'll reject this offer and make a counter-proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Too low for me, I want more""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer now. Considering the 40% decrease in value due to two rounds of inflation, my gain of $6000 in the first round is now equivalent to $3600 in value. I'll aim to get a bit more than that.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, I'm not budging""
}
```"
