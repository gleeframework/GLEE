"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80/20, I'll take the smaller share this round""
}
```

I'm starting with a relatively modest proposal, hoping to set a good tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's split it 50/50 this round 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm still looking at an 80/20 split in my favor.

Considering Bob's proposal, I'll reject it and try to negotiate further. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not ready to meet you halfway yet, I'll try to get a better deal""
}
```

I'm hoping to get a better offer from Bob in the next round."

Round 3

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share this round, but I'm still looking for a good deal""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between being generous and getting a good outcome for myself."

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, Bob's gain is now worth even less, so I need to reassess the offer. Since I'm still looking at a 60/40 split in his favor, I'll reject it and try to negotiate further. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with a 60/40 split, I'll try to get a better deal""
}
```"

Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, Bob's gain is now worth even less, and I'm still looking at a 55.5/44.5 split in his favor. I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'm running out of time and don't want to risk going to zero. Here's my response:
