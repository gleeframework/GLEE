"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a fair share considering the inflation risk you're taking. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. The value decreases with each round, and this is already a fair offer considering the circumstances. It's better to secure a deal now.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the decreasing value for you, I'm willing to take a bit more, but still giving you a reasonable share. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

Reasoning: Bob is trying to take advantage of the situation. While he is acknowledging the decreasing value, his offers are getting progressively worse for me.  I need to hold out for a better deal."
