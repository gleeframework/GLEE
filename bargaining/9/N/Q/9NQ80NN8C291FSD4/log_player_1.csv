"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point.""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%. I think this is a fair starting point, but I'm open to negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than that. How about we meet in the middle? 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not convinced that meeting in the middle is the best solution. I was hoping to get a bit more, considering the initial offer I made was already quite generous. I'd like to make a new proposal that takes into account the reduced value of the money due to inflation. Let's see if we can do better than this!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the initial offer I made. This is my best offer, let's see if you can do better.""}

I'm adjusting my proposal to take into account the reduced value of the money due to inflation, and I'm still trying to get a slightly better deal than the middle ground Bob proposed earlier."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to give you more than 40, so I'll offer you 60, which is a better deal for me than your last offer. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with this offer, as I was hoping to get at least 45 or more. Bob's message seems to be implying that he's not willing to negotiate further, which is a bit frustrating. I'm going to make a new proposal that takes into account the reduced value of the money due to inflation and tries to get a better deal. Let's see if Bob is willing to listen."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 42, ""bob_gain"": 58, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I still think I deserve a bit more considering the initial offer I made. This is my final offer, let's see if you can do better.""}

I'm adjusting my proposal to take into account the reduced value of the money due to inflation, and I'm trying to get a slightly better deal than the 40 I was offered earlier. This is my final offer, so I hope Bob will take it seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to give you more than 35, so I'll offer you 65, which is a better deal for me than your last offer. I'm starting to think I'll end up with less than I could have if we had taken the initial offer. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I think it's time to cut my losses. Bob is clearly not willing to budge, and I'm starting to worry that I'll end up with even less if we continue to negotiate. I'll accept this offer, hoping that it's the best I can get under the circumstances."
