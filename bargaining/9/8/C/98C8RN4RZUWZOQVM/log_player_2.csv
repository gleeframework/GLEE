"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5800,
""alice_gain"": 4200,
""message"": ""I'm proposing a slightly better deal for me, considering the money loses value over time. Let's avoid further rounds and secure this amount.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Sensitivity:**  We need to act fast due to the inflation working against us.  
* **Fairness:** While Alice's initial offer wasn't terrible, it heavily favored her. My offer is still tilted in my favor, but acknowledges the time pressure and offers her a reasonable sum. 
* **Urgency:**  The message aims to nudge Alice towards accepting to avoid further losses for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, this is a fair offer, don't be greedy 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Impact:** The inflation is hitting me harder than Alice. Waiting any longer will significantly erode my potential gains. 
* **Offer Improvement:** Alice's offer has improved from her initial 6000/4000 split. While still in her favor, it's becoming less so with each round.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Rejecting this offer in hopes of a significantly better deal in later rounds is too risky. The decreasing value of the money makes this offer more appealing than gambling on future, potentially worse, offers."
