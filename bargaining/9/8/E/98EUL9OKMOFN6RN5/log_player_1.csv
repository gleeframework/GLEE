Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe a 90-10 split is fair considering the diminishing value of the money in future rounds. I'm willing to compromise, but I need a majority of the pie. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
