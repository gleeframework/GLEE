"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5800 
# Alice gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:** While the money is worth less, Alice's offer is still a gain for me. 
* **Risk/Reward:** If I reject this offer, I risk Alice proposing a worse deal for me in the next round, as she knows I'm feeling the effects of inflation.
* **Gain:** My gain is less than the initial 6000, but it's still significant.  

It's better to accept the offer and secure a gain than to risk a further decrease in my potential earnings."
