"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you 20% of the initial amount.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $100, which is $80, and Bob gets 20%, which is $20."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, Alice. You can have 70% now. 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth 10% less, so the amount I'd get in Round 2 would be 70% of $90 (since $100 is worth $90 now).

Here's my response to Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better. I'll make my next offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, Bob. You can have 25% now. I'm willing to compromise.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 75% of the current $90 (due to inflation), which is $67.50, and Bob gets 25%, which is $22.50."
