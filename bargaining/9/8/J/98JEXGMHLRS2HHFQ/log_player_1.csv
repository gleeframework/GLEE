Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think your 70-30 ratio is too skewed. I'll give you a fairer share, but I'm not giving away too much. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
