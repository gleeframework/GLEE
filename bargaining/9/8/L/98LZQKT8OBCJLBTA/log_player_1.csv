"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}

I propose taking 90 dollars for myself, and leaving 10 dollars for Bob.  This way, I secure a large portion of the money, and Bob still gets something.  Let's see how he feels about this!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I reject this offer.  While Bob's offer does give me something, it's significantly less than my initial proposal.  I'm confident that I can secure a better deal in the next round.  It's my turn to propose!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm going to stick with a similar strategy as Round 1, but slightly adjust it based on Bob's rejection. I'll offer 80 dollars for myself and 20 dollars for Bob. This way, I maintain a substantial share while offering Bob a reasonable increase from his last offer. Let's see if this is more appealing to him!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. Although Bob's offer is higher than the previous round, it's still far less than what I'm aiming for. I believe I can secure a better deal with another round of negotiation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm lowering my proposal slightly to 70 dollars for myself and 30 dollars for Bob. This is a compromise, but I believe it's a fair one. I'm willing to give up some of my initial gain to encourage Bob to accept, but I'm still aiming for a substantial share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I accept this offer. While it's not ideal, it's the best deal I've been offered so far.  The inflation is starting to take its toll, and I don't want to risk getting nothing.  I'll take the 60 dollars and move on."
