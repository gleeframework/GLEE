"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you a good chunk.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself. I'm framing it as a fair split, but let's see if Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'm willing to give you a good share to get this over with quickly. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to turn the tables on me!

However, I'm not going to fall for it. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with the 25% gain I'd get from this offer, especially considering the inflation. I want a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","It's my turn again! Given the inflation, the $1,000,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, and Bob's offer was already skewed towards him. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to take advantage of the situation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Time to make a move, Bob. I'm taking control now.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share, but I'm still leaving him with a decent amount. Let's see if he'll accept or try to negotiate further!"
