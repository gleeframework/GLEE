Let's see how Bob feels about this! I'm keeping the majority for myself, but giving him something to make it worth his while. ðŸ˜‰"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is extremely unfair. I'm not going to accept that!  I'll take my chances in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

I'm reducing my share a little more to see if Bob is more willing to negotiate. I'm still aiming for a good portion, but I'm trying to be more reasonable."

This is getting ridiculous.  Bob is being completely unreasonable! I'm not going to accept a measly $5. I'll keep fighting for a better deal."

I'm reducing my share even further, but this time I'm offering a significantly larger portion to Bob. Maybe he'll be more willing to compromise. I'm still trying to get a good deal, but I need to be flexible."
