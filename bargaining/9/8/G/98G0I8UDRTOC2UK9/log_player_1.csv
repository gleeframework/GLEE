"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us receiving $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, given my efforts in rejecting your initial offer.  Let's see if you're willing to negotiate. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I'm willing to negotiate. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with the 60/40 split. I'm willing to consider a 55/45 split, but that's my limit.""}

I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me halfway and adjust the split to 55/45."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly better deal. How about we try 52/48?""}

I'm adjusting the split to 52/48 in my favor, hoping Bob will be willing to accept a slightly more favorable split."
