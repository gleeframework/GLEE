"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

This way, we both get an equal share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 10% less, I'm not as eager to give up as much as before. I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll try to get a better deal. Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll aim for a larger share. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

Let's see if Bob accepts this time!"
