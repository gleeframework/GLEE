Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get more than 4800 to make this worthwhile.  Let's split the difference from your last offer. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:** 

While Bob is right to point out that time pressure exists for both of us, he's overestimating the impact of inflation on my end. I'm not losing value in the same way he is.  Holding out for a slightly better deal is still the stronger move, even though the rounds are dwindling."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5100,
""bob_gain"": 4900,
""message"": ""This is a compromise, Bob. It acknowledges the time pressure we both face while still reflecting the reality of the situation.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly feeling the pressure, which is good. My last rejection was a calculated risk to make him sweat. However, I need to start showing more willingness to compromise, or he might get desperate and refuse to budge further.  This offer is a small concession on my part, but it keeps the majority of the gains in my favor."
