"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $40 and taking $60 for myself, with a message suggesting that this is a fair split. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a larger share, but my turn comes with a price.  This is my best offer. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer. Given the inflation rates, I'm willing to take a risk and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round. The current offer doesn't seem favorable enough, especially considering the faster devaluation of my potential gains. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I'm being generous""}\n\nGiven the impact of inflation on both our gains, I'm making an offer that still favors me but takes into account the devaluation of the money for both of us. I believe this split is more reasonable, especially considering Bob's previous offer and the fact that my potential gains are devaluing faster. Let's see how Bob responds to this adjusted proposal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is getting ridiculous.  Let's just split it evenly and end this. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on my potential gains, accepting an even split at this point seems like the most reasonable decision. The longer we negotiate, the less value I can potentially gain, and Bob's offer of an even split is fair given the circumstances. It's time to conclude the game with a mutually agreeable outcome."
