I propose to take $900,000 and give Bob $100,000. I think this is a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000} 
``` 

I'm going to lower my initial offer slightly, but still give Bob a significant share. I believe this is a fair and achievable split, given the risk of further inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 5

I'm willing to compromise again. I've increased my offer slightly, but I still need to secure a good portion of the money. The clock is ticking!"
