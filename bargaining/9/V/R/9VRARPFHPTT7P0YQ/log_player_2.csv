Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. I'm offering you 4300, which is more than you'd get in a 55/45 split after another round of inflation. Time is running out! 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700
