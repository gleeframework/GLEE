"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable. This offer is in your best interest. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
Let's see what Alice offers next! I'm not sure I'm happy with that initial split.  Let's see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think this is a fair split.  Let's end this game and take our money!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. This offer benefits you greatly considering the inflation. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While it's not ideal, it's better than the potential for a lower payout due to inflation. I'll accept and take the 3500."
