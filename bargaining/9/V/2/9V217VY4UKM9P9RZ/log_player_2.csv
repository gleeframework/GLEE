Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Still willing to compromise, but need a bit more. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Let's settle this.  This is a fair offer considering the inflation.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is biting, need a better deal. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is feeling the pressure of inflation more strongly now. While her offer is slightly better than her Round 3 offer, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  I'll hold out for a better deal, knowing that each round makes the money less appealing to her."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Okay, let's be fair. 50/50.  Take it or leave it - we're running out of time!""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Time is becoming a factor.  While I could push for a slightly better deal, offering a 50/50 split now:

* **Appears ""fair""**:  This might make Alice more likely to accept quickly.
* **Avoids total loss:**  If we don't settle soon, we both get nothing.  

This strategy prioritizes getting something over risking everything for a slightly higher gain."
