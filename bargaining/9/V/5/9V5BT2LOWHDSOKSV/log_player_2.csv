"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see what Alice offers next!  I'm willing to negotiate, but I want to make sure I get a fair deal.  I'm not going to give away all the money."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly.  It's a fair deal, and it means we both get something.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take a bit less, but still more than half 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll take it!  While I'd prefer an even split, it's better to get something than nothing.  I'm not sure what Alice is thinking, but I'm happy with the deal."
