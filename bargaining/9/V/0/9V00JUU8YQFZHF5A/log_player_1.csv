Round 2

# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Bob has offered me $45 and himself $55, I will reject the offer because I think I can get a better deal in the next round. I also don't want to accept an offer that is the ""same deal but flipped"" as Bob said, since I was the one who initially proposed it and now the money is worth 5% less.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nLet's proceed to the next round!"
