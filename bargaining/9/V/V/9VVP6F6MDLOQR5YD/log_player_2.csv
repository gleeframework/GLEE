Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting us nowhere fast. You lose more each round with the inflation. I'll take a small hit to what I asked for initially, let's close this deal now - $55 for me, $45 for you. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
