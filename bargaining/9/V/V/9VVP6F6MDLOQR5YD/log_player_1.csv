Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair to split the money more evenly, considering the value is decreasing with each round.  Let's try 55 for me and 45 for you. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55
