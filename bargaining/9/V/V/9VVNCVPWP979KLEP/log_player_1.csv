"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable for the first round. If Bob accepts, we can proceed to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take more this time 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting already!

I'll reject Bob's offer. My gain of 30 is worth 24 (60% of 30) after the 20% reduction, and Bob's gain of 70 remains the same. I'd rather wait for a better offer. 

```

}
```"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer for Round 3. Since the money is worth 40% of its original value due to inflation, I'll aim for a smaller share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 20,
  ""bob_gain"": 80,
  ""message"": ""Be careful, the money is losing value fast. Better to take what we can get.""
}
```

This time, I'm offering Bob a larger share, hoping he'll accept and we can move on."

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not getting any more generous, I'll take control 
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll! My gain of 15 is worth 7.2 (60% of 12, since 60% of 20 is 12) after the 48.8% reduction, and Bob's gain of 85 remains the same.

I'll reject Bob's offer again, hoping he'll make a more reasonable proposal in the next round.

  ""bob_gain"": 90,
  ""message"": ""We're running out of time. Better to split it now than lose everything.""

# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really crippling the value of my potential gain! My gain of 5 is worth 1.8 (4% of 45, since 4% of 10 is 0.4, and 0.4 * 10 is 4, and 4 * 11.25 is 45) after the 67.23% reduction, and Bob's gain of 95 remains the same.

# Alice gain: 1
