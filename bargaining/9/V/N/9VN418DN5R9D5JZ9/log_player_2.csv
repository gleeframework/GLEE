Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time.  I'm proposing a 51/49 split.  It's a slight advantage for me considering the inflation, but it ensures we both leave with a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 490000 
# Alice gain: 510000

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. We're both losing out because of the inflation. I'm proposing a 50/50 split.  Take it or leave it, but we need to decide now! 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is it.  A 50/50 split is fair in principle, and while I could gamble on getting slightly more in the remaining rounds, the risk of getting nothing is too great. Alice is clearly feeling the pressure too, making this the safest option."
