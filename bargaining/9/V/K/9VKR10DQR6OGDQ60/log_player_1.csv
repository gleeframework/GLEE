"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. Your turn to respond?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my $5,000 gain is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so it's actually worth $4,500.

I accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
