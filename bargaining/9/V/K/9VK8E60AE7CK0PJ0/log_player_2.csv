Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in Round 5 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** With only 7 rounds remaining, the risk of walking away with nothing significantly increases with each rejection.
* **Diminishing Returns:** The longer the game continues, the less Bob's potential gains are worth due to the 20% inflation rate working against him.  
* **Alice's Stance:** Alice has consistently offered amounts around the 30-35% mark for Bob. Her ""final offer"" language suggests she might not be willing to budge much further.

It's a tough decision, but taking the guaranteed $350,000 (even with the inflation impact) outweighs the risk of ending up with nothing if a favorable agreement can't be reached in the remaining rounds."
