"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 40 and keep 60. Let's see if you'll accept.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems fair to me, and I'm curious to see if Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, let's see if you'll accept this one! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of 70 is actually worth 56 (since 70 * 0.8 = 56) and Bob's gain of 30 is worth 28.8 (since 30 * 0.952 = 28.8).

Considering this, I'm not sure if I should accept Bob's offer. I'll reject it and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer for Round 3. Due to the inflation, the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, so I'll aim to get a slightly larger share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 20, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation. Let's see if you'll accept this time.""
}
```

I'm proposing an 80-20 split, which is a bit more in my favor, but still a relatively fair offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give away too much. Let's see if you'll accept this time! 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values:

My gain of 75 is worth 39.6 (since 75 * 0.524 = 39.6) and Bob's gain of 25 is worth 21.15 (since 25 * 0.846 = 21.15).

Considering the offer, I'm not sure if I should accept it. I was hoping for a better deal, but this is still a decent offer. I'll reject it and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect, the money is worth even less than in the previous round. I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the reduced value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a small share, but I need to prioritize my own gain now. Let's see if you'll accept this time.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 90-10 split, which is a significant increase in my share, but I'm willing to take the risk of Bob rejecting it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give away too much. Let's see if you'll accept this time! 
# Alice gain: 85 
# Bob gain: 15 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values:

My gain of 85 is worth 28.1 (since 85 * 0.331 = 28.1) and Bob's gain of 15 is worth 11.55 (since 15 * 0.767 = 11.55).

Considering the offer, I'm not sure if I should accept it. I was hoping for a better deal, but this is still a decent offer. I'll reject it and try to negotiate further.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect, the money is worth even less than in the previous round. I'll aim to get as much as I can in this last round.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 99,
  ""bob_gain"": 1,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a risk and ask for almost all of the money. It's now or never!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 99-1 split, which is a very one-sided deal, but I'm willing to take the risk of Bob rejecting it."
