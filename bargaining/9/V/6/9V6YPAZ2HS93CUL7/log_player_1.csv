"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

This is my initial offer. I want to keep the majority of the money, but I'm also offering a small amount to Bob to hopefully incentivize him to accept.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even with the 20% inflation, this offer is still better than what I would get if we keep rejecting each other.  Let's take the deal!"
