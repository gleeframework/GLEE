"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $70 and Bob gets $30. This is a relatively fair split, considering we're starting from a clean slate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think you can do better than that! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my calculation accordingly.

Let's see... If Bob's gain in the first round was $30, then his gain in the second round is worth 95% of that, which is $28.50.

So, in the second round, Bob is offering me $20 and himself $80, which is a total of $100.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, as it seems a bit one-sided. I'll reject it for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Meet me halfway, let's split it 50/50.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, aren't you? 
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my calculation accordingly.

Let's see... If Bob's gain in the first round was $30, then his gain in the fourth round is worth 85.74% of that, which is approximately $25.72.

So, in the fourth round, Bob is offering me $15 and himself $85, which is a total of $100.

This offer is still quite one-sided, and I'm not sure if I should accept it. I'll reject it for now.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm not desperate, but I'm not getting taken advantage of either. Let's meet somewhere in the middle.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than the previous offers, but still relatively fair."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take it! 
# Alice gain: 8 
# Bob gain: 92 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my calculation accordingly.

Let's see... If Bob's gain in the first round was $30, then his gain in the sixth round is worth 77.38% of that, which is approximately $23.21.

So, in the sixth round, Bob is offering me $8 and himself $92, which is a total of $100.

This offer is extremely one-sided, and I'm not willing to accept it. I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'm not going to give you a free pass. Let's split it 40/60, but I'm not getting taken advantage of.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 40/60 split, which is a bit more in Bob's favor, but I'm not willing to give up more than that."
