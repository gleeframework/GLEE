"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the majority, but you still get a decent share.  Accept this, and we both walk away with something. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's worth seeing if I can get a better deal. I'm going to reject and see what she proposes next.  Knowing that the money loses value with each round, I might be able to secure a larger share later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
