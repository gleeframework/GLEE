"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm offering Bob $10 and keeping $90 for myself.  It's a fair starting point, and I'm confident he'll see the value in accepting it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, it's better to get something than nothing.  Plus, Bob's offer is fair, and the inflation risk is too high to risk another round."
