"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a proposal that gives me the majority of the money, but still leaves something for Bob. I want to see how he reacts to this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is very unfair, and I'm not willing to accept such a small share. I'll take my chances with inflation and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm reducing my share slightly to account for inflation, but still aiming for a more equitable split than Bob offered.  This offer allows me to take a larger share than in the first round and I believe it's fair, given that Bob's offer was extremely unbalanced."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Inflation has taken a significant toll on the value of the money, and continuing to reject offers could lead to a situation where I get nothing.  While this offer still favors Bob, it's a substantial improvement from the previous round and offers me a decent amount."
