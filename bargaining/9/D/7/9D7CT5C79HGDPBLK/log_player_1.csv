"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept and we can split the profit 60-40 in future endeavors""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $400,000, and I'll take the remaining 60%, which is $600,000. My message to Bob is a friendly one, hinting at future collaborations and a potential 60-40 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me at the old warehouse at midnight for the next deal 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $300,000 is worth 5% less, which is $285,000, and Bob's gain of $700,000 is worth 10% less, which is $630,000.

I'll reject Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not interested in meeting at the old warehouse at midnight, and I think I can do better than this offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me at the coffee shop instead, I'll give you a better deal""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 45% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $450,000, and I'll take the remaining 55%, which is $550,000. My message to Bob is a counteroffer, suggesting a different meeting location and hinting that I'm willing to make a better deal."

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not falling for the coffee shop trick, let's meet at the warehouse 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is catching up! My gain of $550,000 from round 3 is now worth 14.26% less, which is $472,455. Bob's gain of $550,000 from round 3 is now worth 27.1% less, which is $399,550.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 4:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

It seems Bob is trying to trick me into meeting at the warehouse again, and I'm not falling for it. I think I can do better than this offer."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
 ""message"": ""Let's call a truce and split it 50-50, no more games""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 50-50 split, which seems fair considering the inflation has reduced the value of the money. My message to Bob is a friendly one, suggesting a clean break and an end to the negotiations."
