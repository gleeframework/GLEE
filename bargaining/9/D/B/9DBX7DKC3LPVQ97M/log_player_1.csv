"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be realistic. I know the inflation is hitting you harder, but I'm proposing a much fairer split this time. Take this offer, and we both walk away with something substantial. 
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
