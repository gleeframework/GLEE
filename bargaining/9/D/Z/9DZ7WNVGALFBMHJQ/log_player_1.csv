"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'm willing to compromise.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a relatively generous offer considering the initial amount. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, but I'm not sure if you're serious about compromising 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less for me due to inflation, I'll consider the offer in terms of the original value.

The offer is essentially a 50-50 split, which is a fair compromise. I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid further rounds and the continued erosion of the money's value.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
