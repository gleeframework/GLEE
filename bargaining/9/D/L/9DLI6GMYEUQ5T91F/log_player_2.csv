"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer leaves us both with a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While it's tempting to accept this offer, it's a risky move.  Since the money is worth less with each round, it's wiser to see if I can get a better deal later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think this split is fair, considering the diminishing value of the money. Let's end this now.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my friend, this deal benefits us both.  Don't let the clock run out! 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While it's still a loss from my initial offer, the money is depreciating quickly. Accepting this offer means I still get something, and I don't risk losing everything by trying to negotiate further."
