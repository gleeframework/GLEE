"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, I'm the only one who knows the inflation rate!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get all the money, and Bob gets nothing. I'm trying to make a strong opening offer to see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Don't think you're the only one who's smart! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","A clever counteroffer from Bob!

I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better. I'm not convinced that he's being entirely transparent about the inflation rate, and I don't want to settle for 20% of the original amount. I'll make my next offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Meet me halfway, and we can both walk away with something!""
}
```

I'm trying to be more reasonable this time, and I'm proposing a 60-40 split. I think this is a fair compromise, and it gives Bob a decent chunk of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time's running out, let's make a deal! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation rate is getting crazy!

I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. With the inflation rate getting out of control, I think it's better to take 50% of the original amount now rather than risking losing everything in the next rounds. It's a fair split, and I'm willing to settle for it."
