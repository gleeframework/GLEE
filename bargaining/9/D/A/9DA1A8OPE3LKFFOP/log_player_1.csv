"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the $100, and Bob gets 40%. I'm being generous, but I think this is a fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to be fair, but I'd like a slightly bigger share this round. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing!

Considering the new offer, I'll think for a moment... I'm not too happy about giving up a bigger share, but I don't want to risk going to the next round and losing even more value. I'll accept Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
