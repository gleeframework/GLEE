I propose a 900,000 - 100,000 split in my favor. It's a generous offer, but I want to ensure I get the majority of the money. Let's see what Bob thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being greedy! I'll reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round.  The money is worth less to me now, but I'm not giving up without a fight!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm willing to compromise, but I still need to get a fair share. This offer gives Bob a larger share than the previous round, but I still get the majority. Let's see if he'll accept this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is insulting!  I'll reject it and make my own offer in the next round. Inflation is hurting me, but I won't settle for a deal that's so unfair."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm making a final stand. I'm reducing my share significantly, but I need to ensure I get something substantial. This is my last offer, and if Bob rejects it, I'm prepared for the consequences."
