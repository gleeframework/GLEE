"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, seems fair""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $10,000, leaving Bob with 40%. I'm framing it as a fair split, but we'll see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but still a decent amount 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Given the inflation, my $3000 gain is now worth 20% less than in the first round, which is $2400 in real terms. Bob's $7000 gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, which is $6650 in real terms.

Considering the decreased value of the money, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. However, I'm not sure if I want to risk going to the next round, where the money will be worth even less.

For now, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","It's my turn again. Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth less and less with each round, I'll aim for a higher percentage of the remaining amount to compensate for the decreased value.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a slightly bigger share to account for the inflation""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly bigger share, but still a decent amount considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money!

Considering the offer, my $3500 gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, which is approximately $1800 in real terms. Bob's $6500 gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, which is approximately $5500 in real terms.

Given the decreased value of the money, I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. However, I don't want to risk going to the next round, where the money will be worth even less.

For now, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","It's my turn again. Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth significantly less with each round, I'll aim for an even higher percentage of the remaining amount to compensate for the decreased value.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering the inflation""
}
```"
