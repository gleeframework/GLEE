Let's see how this goes. I'm willing to negotiate, but that offer isn't fair to me given the inflation."

# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is barely budging!  This is getting ridiculous.  The clock (and inflation) is ticking."

# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is cutting it close, but I have to accept.  Another round and inflation will decimate my share."
