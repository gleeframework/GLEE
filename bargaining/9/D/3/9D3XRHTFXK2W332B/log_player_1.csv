Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, my turn. I'm feeling the inflation pinch already, so I need a larger share to make this worthwhile.  Let's settle this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 65,
""bob_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""Bob, that's a tough deal for me. I'm willing to compromise slightly, but the deal needs to be fair for both of us.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting painful.  Inflation is eating my share away.  Meet me in the middle, and let's end this. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is feeling the pressure of inflation, his offer is still not favorable to me. I will continue to negotiate for a better split, knowing that each round makes him more desperate to settle."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be reasonable, but I need a larger share to make this worthwhile. This is my final offer.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time pressure:**  With each round, Bob's share is worth significantly less. Time is on my side.
* **Finality:** Presenting this as my ""final offer"" creates a sense of urgency and may push Bob to accept a less favorable deal than he'd prefer if he stalls much longer. 
* **Slight concession:** I've moved a bit from my previous offer to show I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm holding firm on getting a larger share."
