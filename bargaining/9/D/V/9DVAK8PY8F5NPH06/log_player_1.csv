Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going for a very aggressive first offer. I want to secure a large share, knowing the money will be worth less in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, accepting this offer guarantees me at least $5,000. With the inflation, my share would likely be less in the next round. It's time to take what I can get!"
