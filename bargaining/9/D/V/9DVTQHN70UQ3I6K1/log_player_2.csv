"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split close to 50/50, but take into account that the value decreases over time. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'd like to propose a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think I should get a bit more.""}\n\n###\nNow it's Alice's turn.\n\n###\nPlease respond with Alice's decision and message."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. This is your last chance to get a reasonable deal before inflation significantly eats into your share. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nI'll take the offer. Further rounds would only decrease the value of the money for me, and I don't think I can negotiate a significantly better deal considering the inflation."
