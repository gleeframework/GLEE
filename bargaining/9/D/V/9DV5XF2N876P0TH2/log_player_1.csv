"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 20% of the total, and I'll take the rest.""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob a relatively small amount, but still a fair share, and I'll take the majority of the money. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. 50/50 split seems like the most sensible option. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my potential gain is now worth 20% less than in the previous round.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think for a moment...

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'd like to get a bit more to compensate for the decrease in value. However, a 50/50 split is a reasonable proposal, and it's a good opportunity to get a decent share of the remaining money.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
