"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a fair proposal. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. With the inflation rates, the money I gain is worth 20% less than the initial amount, and Bob's gain is worth 5% less. This offer is not as favorable as the first one I made, but it's still a decent split.

I'll decide to accept this offer.
