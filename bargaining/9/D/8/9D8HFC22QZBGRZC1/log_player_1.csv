"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a relatively generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure an agreement quickly.  While I want a larger share, I need to balance that with the risk of Bob rejecting and potentially getting a better deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is more generous than my initial proposal, it's still significantly less than what I could potentially get in the next round. With the inflation factor, I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal for myself.  Rejecting this offer allows me to make a counter-proposal and potentially secure a larger share of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

**Explanation:**

Knowing Bob is willing to negotiate, I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round. This reflects my understanding of the inflation factor and my confidence in securing a favorable outcome. I aim to strike a balance between getting a larger share and reaching an agreement before further inflation erodes the value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer, while not ideal, represents a significant improvement over my previous negotiation. After two rounds of rejection and the significant inflation factor, it's clear that I'm unlikely to get a better deal. Accepting this offer ensures I receive a substantial amount of money, even with the reduced value due to inflation. It's a compromise that ensures a fair division and ends the game before further potential losses from inflation."
