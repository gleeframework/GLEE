"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a fair share, let's end the game early!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a generous 10% of the total amount, and keeping $900,000 for myself. The message is a friendly one, hoping to persuade Bob to accept the offer and end the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50 and end the game 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

I'm not sure if I want to split it 50/50, considering the money is worth less with each round. However, it's a fair offer, and it's a good opportunity to end the game early.
