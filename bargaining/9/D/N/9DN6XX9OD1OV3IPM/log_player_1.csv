"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept this and we can end the game early.""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount of money, and I'm giving you a chance to accept and end the game quickly."

# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round. Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think I can do better than a 50/50 split, especially considering the inflation factor. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
