**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing a tough game, but time is working against me more than her.  While her offer is significantly better than her last, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. I need to show I'm willing to walk away, but also offer a path that's somewhat palatable to her.  My hope is that the rapidly decreasing value will push her to be more reasonable in the next round or two."
