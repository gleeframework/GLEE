"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous. Take this and let's be done with it. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm Bob, and I want to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly. This way, we both get a good share.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable here. I'm willing to give you a good chunk, but I also need a fair share. This is a better deal for both of us than last round. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer more, the money is losing value rapidly. Accepting this deal ensures I get something, and it's a significant improvement over the previous round."
