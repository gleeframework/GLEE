"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I propose I take $650,000 and you take $350,000. This division gives us both a significant sum right away. Let's avoid letting inflation eat into our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Alice, I believe a more balanced split is fairer. I'm offering you $400,000,  which is still a considerable amount.  Let's reach an agreement before the inflation bites too hard.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want a good deal. I'm adjusting my offer to $550,000 for me and $450,000 for you. This recognizes the impact of inflation on both our ends while still giving me a slight advantage for proposing first.  Let's settle this now before the money shrinks further. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
