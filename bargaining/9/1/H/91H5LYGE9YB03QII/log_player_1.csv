Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I believe a more balanced split is fairer. I'm offering you $400,000,  which is still a considerable amount.  Let's reach an agreement before the inflation bites too hard. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
