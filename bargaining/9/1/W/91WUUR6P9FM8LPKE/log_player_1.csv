"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn to propose!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a good compromise. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth less due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject this offer for now. The money is worth less, but I'd like to try to get a slightly better share.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new proposal for Round 3. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher share to compensate.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while. Your turn to respond!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway and split it 50/50. Let's end this now. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","A 50/50 split is a reasonable compromise, and considering the money is worth significantly less due to inflation, I think it's a good time to accept.
