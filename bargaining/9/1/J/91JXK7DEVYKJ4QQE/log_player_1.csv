Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. We both get a fair share this way, and I avoid the inflation hit.

# Bob gain: 500000

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise further, but I need a better deal than that. This offer is still fair considering the inflation, and it gives us both a decent share. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is still slightly worse for me than the previous round, the inflation is significantly impacting his potential gains.  It's unlikely he'll offer anything significantly better in future rounds, and I risk getting even less if we continue. Accepting now guarantees a reasonable share."
