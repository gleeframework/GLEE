I propose a 900,000/100,000 split. I'm aiming for a fair but advantageous start, leaving room for negotiation if Bob wants to play."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but still aiming for a larger share,  as Bob has shown a willingness to play hardball. This offer leaves room for further negotiation while still ensuring a decent outcome for me."
