"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll give you a decent chunk, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of.""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm not being too greedy either."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give away too much either. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll think carefully before making a decision.

After considering the offer, I'll...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that Bob is being generous enough, and I think I can do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The stakes are higher now, and the money is worth less due to inflation.

Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You're not giving me enough, Bob! I'm willing to compromise, but I need a fair share.""
}
```

I'm trying to negotiate a better deal for myself, but I'm still leaving some room for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to break the bank. You're getting close to what I'm willing to give. 
# Alice gain: 6500 
# Bob gain: 3500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting, and the money is worth less and less.

After considering Bob's offer, I'll...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think I've reached a fair compromise, and I'm willing to accept Bob's offer. The money isn't as valuable as it was initially, but I'm not going to push my luck further."
