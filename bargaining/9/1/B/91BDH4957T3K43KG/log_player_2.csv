{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe a 60/40 split in my favor is more fair, given the potential for inflation. Let's start with this, and we can adjust as the game progresses.""}

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your point, but a 60/40 split in your favor is too much. How about we meet in the middle with a 55/45 split? It's a compromise that considers the inflation risk but is still fair to both of us. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
