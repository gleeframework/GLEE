Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe a 60/40 split in my favor is more fair, given the potential for inflation. Let's start with this, and we can adjust as the game progresses. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60
