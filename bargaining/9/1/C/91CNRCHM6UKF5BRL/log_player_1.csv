"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I get a bit more""}\n\nI'll start by offering a division of $60 for myself and $40 for Bob. I've included a message that suggests this is a fair division, but slightly in my favor. Since there's no inflation effect on me, I'm aiming to get a bit more than half. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn to propose something more in my favor. This is a reasonable starting point. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Although the money is worth the same to me as in the first round, I initially offered a division where I got $60, and now Bob is offering me $45, which is significantly less. Given that I have more rounds to negotiate and the inflation affects Bob more, I'll hold out for a better offer. Let's see what the next round brings!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering your loss to inflation, this is a generous offer""}\n\nIn this round, I'll offer a division of $58 for myself and $42 for Bob. Given that Bob is losing value due to inflation, I'm framing this as a generous offer, slightly decreasing my initial proposal to show willingness to compromise. I'm still aiming to get more than half, taking advantage of the fact that inflation doesn't affect me. Let's see how Bob responds to this adjusted offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest option. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer of a 50/50 split. Although Bob frames this as the fairest option and suggests it's a take-it-or-leave-it deal, I recognize that Bob is under more pressure due to inflation. Since the money is worth 27.1% less to Bob than in the first round, I believe I have the upper hand in negotiations. I initially aimed for more than half, and Bob's offer doesn't meet my target. I'm willing to continue negotiating, hoping to get a better deal in the next rounds."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I'm being more than fair""}\n\nIn this round, I'll offer a division of $57 for myself and $43 for Bob. Given the increasing impact of inflation on Bob's share, I'm emphasizing that this offer is more than fair. I'm slightly adjusting my previous offer downward to show a willingness to compromise, but I'm still aiming to get more than half of the money. I want to convey that I'm taking Bob's losses due to inflation into account while also pushing for a favorable outcome for myself. Let's see how Bob responds to this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a compromise, Alice. I'm taking a hit from inflation, so you need to move a bit too. 
# Alice gain: 52 
# Bob gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll reject Bob's offer. Although Bob is taking a significant hit from inflation, with the money being worth 40.95% less than in the first round, the offer of $52 for me and $48 for Bob doesn't meet my expectations. Given the substantial impact of inflation on Bob's share, I believe I can negotiate a better deal. I'll continue to push for a more favorable outcome, considering Bob's increasing losses due to inflation. Let's see what the next round brings!### {""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll offer a division of $56 for myself and $44 for Bob. Given the significant impact of inflation on Bob's share, I'm framing this as a reasonable adjustment to my previous offers. I'm taking into account Bob's losses due to inflation, which now amount to nearly 41% of the original value, but I'm still aiming to get more than half of the money. I want to convey that I'm willing to find a mutually acceptable solution while also pushing for a favorable outcome for myself.
