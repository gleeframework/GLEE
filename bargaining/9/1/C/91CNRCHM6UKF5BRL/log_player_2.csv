Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering your loss to inflation, this is a generous offer 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest option. Take it or leave it.""}

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, I'm being more than fair 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to take advantage of my shrinking pot.  I need to hold firm, even though the pressure is on.  A 43/57 split is still heavily in her favor, especially given the inflation working against me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 48,
""alice_gain"": 52,
""message"": ""This is a compromise, Alice. I'm taking a hit from inflation, so you need to move a bit too.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Time is running out and I need to show some flexibility to avoid getting zero. Offering a slight advantage to Alice while still securing a decent share for myself seems like the best strategy at this point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering your significant inflation losses, this is a reasonable adjustment 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The pressure is really on now. I'm losing almost half the value each round.  While not ideal, getting 44 is better than risking nothing if this drags on and Alice continues to lowball me."
