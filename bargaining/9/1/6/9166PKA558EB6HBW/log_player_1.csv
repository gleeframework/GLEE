"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! Accept and we'll be done!""
}

I'm proposing that I get the entire $100, and Bob gets nothing. The message is a friendly reminder to Bob that this is the first round and we can wrap up quickly if he accepts."
