Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer.  It's a reasonable split that gives us both a good deal.  Take it now, or I'm aiming for the majority in the remaining rounds. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While the pressure is on with fewer rounds remaining and increasing inflation, Alice's offer is still heavily skewed in her favor. Accepting now would mean Bob loses out significantly on the potential gains from a fairer deal. Bob needs to hold his ground and hope Alice becomes more willing to compromise as the rounds progress."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 490000,
""alice_gain"": 510000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer. Take it or leave it.  I'm offering you slightly more than half, acknowledging the time pressure, but I won't accept anything less than this. Let's end this now and avoid the risk of getting nothing.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

With six rounds remaining and inflation rapidly diminishing Bob's potential gains, it's time to draw a hard line. This offer presents a small concession, giving Alice slightly more than half, but makes it clear this is Bob's bottom line.  This approach aims to:

* **Convey urgency:**  The ""take it or leave it"" language stresses the limited time remaining. 
* **Project firmness:**  Bob is clearly stating his non-negotiable minimum. 
* **Offer a (small) incentive:** Giving Alice a slight edge might make her more likely to accept than risk a worse outcome in later rounds.

It's a risky strategy, but at this stage, a firm stance is necessary to avoid getting stuck with increasingly unfavorable deals as time runs out."
