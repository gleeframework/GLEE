"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we each get $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, given the potential for inflation. Let's start with this and see how we go. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept a 60/40 split, especially since I'm already losing value due to inflation. I'd like to propose a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 420000, ""bob_gain"": 580000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 58/42 is a more reasonable split considering the inflation. Let's try this one!""}

I'm proposing a 58/42 split, which is slightly more favorable to me than Bob's previous offer, but still takes into account the decreasing value of money."
