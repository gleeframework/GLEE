"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you a decent share!""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fair.  Let's be reasonable and move forward. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","My offer from round 1 was 70, which is worth 90% of the original amount in round 2, so I would have gained 63 in round 2. This new offer from Bob is even more generous than my original proposal, and I'm not sure if I want to give up that extra 18 dollars. However, I don't want to be greedy and risk getting an even worse offer in the next round.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 90% of its original value in round 2, it's now worth 81% of its original value in round 3. I'll make a new offer, taking into account the reduced value.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 56,
  ""bob_gain"": 44,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a good deal, but I need a bit more.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's just split it evenly.  We're both losing money with each round, and this is the fairest solution. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is now worth a lot less than before. Since I would have gained 63 in round 2 and 56 in round 3, I'll gain 43.38 in round 4, considering the 27.1% reduction. Bob's offer of 50 is actually a better deal for me than my previous offers, considering the reduced value of the money.
