"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm starting with a 60/40 split in my favor. This feels like a fair starting point, and it leaves room for negotiation if Bob isn't happy with it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a more even split, the inflation means that waiting another round would drastically decrease the value of my potential gains. This offer, while not ideal, is still better than risking a further reduction in value."
