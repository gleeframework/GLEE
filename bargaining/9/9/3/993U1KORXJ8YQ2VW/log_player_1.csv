Let's see if Bob is happy with this deal!  I'm hoping to get a good chunk of the money, but I'm also willing to share a bit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

Even though I only get $1000, it's better than nothing!  I'm not sure how inflation is affecting Bob, but I'm guessing he's feeling pretty good about this deal."
