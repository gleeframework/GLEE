Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Alice rejected the 50/50 split, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Considering the 20% inflation, I'll aim for a higher share. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I'll try to adjust my expectations. Since Alice's offer is closer to the original 50/50 split, I'll accept it this time.
