"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000,
""bob_gain"": 200000,
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable. Take this offer and we both win.""}
``` 

This offer heavily favors Alice, but it's important to start strong given the inflation factor. Bob might be inclined to accept a decent offer now rather than risk getting a much smaller share later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, Alice. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is terrible considering the inflation. Let's see if he gets more reasonable in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000,
""bob_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""I'm aiming for a fairer split this time. Let's close this deal and avoid further losses.""}
``` 

This offer is more aggressive to account for the increasing inflation.  It's becoming crucial to reach an agreement quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The clock is ticking, Alice. This is a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is still not a good deal for Alice, even considering the inflation. Bob is clearly trying to take advantage, but Alice needs to hold firm and aim for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 650000,
""bob_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Time is running out, Bob. This is my final offer. Let's be reasonable and end this.""}
``` 

This offer is a slight compromise on Alice's part, but it's still heavily in her favor considering the inflation. The ""final offer"" message adds pressure on Bob to accept before the value diminishes further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous. Accept this offer before inflation eats away at your share even more. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a tough one, but still a no from Alice.  While the inflation is getting severe, accepting this offer would mean getting less than half of the original amount. Bob is clearly banking on Alice panicking as the rounds progress.  Alice needs to hold her ground a little longer and hope Bob gets more reasonable."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is it. Take this offer, or we both walk away with nothing. Don't be greedy.""}
``` 

This is Alice's most significant concession yet. It's a 60/40 split, which is much more in line with Bob's previous offers. However, the strong message emphasizes the urgency of the situation.  Alice needs to make it clear that this is a final offer and Bob risks losing everything if he rejects."
