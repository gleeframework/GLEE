"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 

This is a very aggressive opening offer, aiming to secure nearly all the money. It's risky, as Bob could easily reject it, but it sets the stage for a potentially high gain for Alice."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

This is a good opportunity for Alice to leverage her position. While Bob's offer is fair on the surface, Alice has the advantage of knowing that Bob's money is being devalued by inflation.  Rejecting this offer keeps the pressure on Bob and allows Alice to potentially negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer is still very favorable to Alice, but it's a slight step back from the aggressive opening offer. It acknowledges that Bob's offer, while rejected, still has some value.  The goal is to incentivize Bob to accept while still securing a large portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice should reject this offer.  While the offer is significantly in Bob's favor, Alice has the advantage of knowing Bob's money is being devalued rapidly by inflation. She can likely secure a much better deal for herself in the remaining rounds by continuing to reject offers and making counter-offers."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}

# Bob gain: 666667 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even though Bob's offer is significantly more favorable to him, Alice should still reject it.  The inflation effect is working in her favor, and by rejecting this offer, she can maintain control and likely secure a better deal in the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

This offer is a further concession, but still very favorable to Alice. It reflects the increasing pressure from inflation on Bob, while still leaving Alice with a substantial portion of the money.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 375000 
# Bob gain: 625000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice should reject this offer.  While it's a slightly better offer for Alice than the previous round, the inflation effect is still heavily in her favor.  Alice can likely secure a better deal in the remaining rounds by continuing to reject offers and making counter-offers."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

This offer is another concession from Alice, but still secures a significant portion of the money.  Inflation is making Bob's position increasingly difficult, and this offer is a strong attempt to entice him to accept before the value of his share diminishes further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 416667 
# Bob gain: 583333 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While this is a better offer for Alice than the previous round, she should still reject it. The inflation effect is working strongly in her favor, and with only a few rounds remaining, she can likely secure a better deal by continuing to reject offers and making counter-offers."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

With only two rounds remaining, this offer is a significant concession from Alice.  The goal is to find a balance between securing a good amount for herself and incentivizing Bob to accept before the value of his share drops too low.  The inflation effect is still working in Alice's favor, but the pressure is mounting with fewer rounds remaining."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 43.12% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is Alice's last chance to get any money. The inflation effect is working heavily in her favor, but it's not guaranteed that Bob will offer a better deal in the next round, even with the inflation penalty on his money.  Accepting this offer secures a 50/50 split, which is significantly better than getting nothing.  The risk of getting zero is too high, especially considering the rapid inflation on Bob's money."
