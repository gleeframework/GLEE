"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000, which is a relatively small amount, hoping he'll think it's a good starting point and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try for a more balanced split this time! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less after the first round, my gain of $800,000 is now worth $640,000.

Bob's new offer is a 50/50 split, which is a significant increase from his previous offer. However, considering the inflation, I'm still getting a relatively smaller share compared to the original amount. I'll think carefully before making a decision.

I'll reject this offer for now, hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

I'll make a new offer, trying to take into account the decreasing value of the money.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,

# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 48.8% less after the third round, my gain of $512,000 is now worth $264,736.

Bob's new offer is a 45/55 split, which is still not in my favor, considering the decreasing value of the money. However, I'm running out of time, and I need to make a decision.

I'll reject this offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 67.23% less after the fifth round, my gain of $134,511.968 is now worth $44,111.0368.

Bob's new offer is a 40/60 split, which is still not in my favor, but I'm getting desperate. I need to consider the fact that I'm getting close to getting nothing if we don't make a deal soon.
