"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time. Inflation is a risk for both of us, so a 50/50 split seems like the safest option to avoid getting nothing at all. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000
