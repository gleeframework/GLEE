# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me only $300,000. I was hoping for a more even split, and Bob's offer is too lopsided in his favor. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round."
