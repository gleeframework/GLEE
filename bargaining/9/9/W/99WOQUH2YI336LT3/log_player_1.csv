"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. Since the money is worth 10% less for me, I'm not sure if I should accept a proposal that gives me less than I initially offered. On the other hand, if I reject this offer, I'll have to make another proposal, and the money will be worth 10% less again. 

I'll decide to accept this offer.
