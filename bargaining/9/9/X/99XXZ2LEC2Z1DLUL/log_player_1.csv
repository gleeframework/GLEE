"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob! Let's get this over with!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me the majority of the money, but still a decent amount for Bob. The message is a bit aggressive, but I'm trying to create some pressure to get a deal done quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your turn was generous, but I'm not done yet! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is quite aggressive, taking a larger share of the money. I'll have to think carefully about this one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further. I'm not willing to give up 40% of the money in the second round. I'll make a new offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth 10% less than in the first round. Since Bob's offer in round 2 was 700,000, that means he's now offering 665,000 in round 3.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob! Let's make a deal!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42-58 split, trying to find a more balanced compromise. The message is a bit more conciliatory, hoping to create a sense of fairness and encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not satisfied, Alice. You can do better than that! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer in round 4 is still quite close to the previous offer, but with a slightly smaller amount for me. I'll consider it, but I'm not ready to give up yet.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further. I'm not willing to give up 5% of the money, especially since it's worth less in value due to inflation. I'll make a new offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 5, the money is worth 20.4% less than in the first round. Since Bob's offer in round 4 was 550,000, that means he's now offering 493.5,000 in round 5.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""message"": ""Getting close, Bob! Don't be greedy, let's make a deal!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 48-52 split, trying to find a more balanced compromise. The message is a bit more urgent, hoping to create a sense of momentum and encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: It's getting serious, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway now. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is finally willing to meet me halfway. A 50-50 split is a fair and reasonable offer, especially considering the value of the money is decreasing due to inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer and we can finally divide the money. A 50-50 split seems like a fair and reasonable outcome, and I'm willing to end the game here."
