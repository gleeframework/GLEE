"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. I'll take 80% and you take 20%""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount, and it's a relatively fair split. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, Alice. Take 60% and I'll take 40% 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting the value of the money!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think for a moment...

I'll accept this offer. The 60% is a decent amount, and it's better than what I initially proposed. I'll take the 6000 and we can move on to the next round.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
