Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer.  It's still a good deal for both of us.  If you reject it, the next round will be even worse for you. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to use intimidation tactics, emphasizing the decreasing value of the money for both of us. However, the devaluation impacts her significantly more than me. While her offer is better than her first, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. I'm betting she'll become more willing to negotiate as the rounds progress and she sees I'm serious about getting a fairer share."

""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly.  It's the fairest option now, considering the shrinking value of our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is finally acknowledging the impact of the devaluation. A 50/50 split is a fair outcome at this point in the game. Accepting ensures I get a significant share, whereas continuing to push for a slightly larger piece risks ending up with nothing if we run out of rounds."
