"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I'm sure you'll appreciate it more since it's worth more to you now. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of $4000 is now worth 80% of its original value, and Bob's gain of $6000 is worth 90% of its original value.

I'm not thrilled about the 40-60 split, but I think I can do better than the original 60-40 split. I'll accept this offer for now.
