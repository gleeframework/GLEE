"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer ensures we both benefit. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I'm feeling generous, Alice. Let's wrap this up.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Value of Money:** Delaying is costly for Bob due to the 20% inflation. It makes sense to try and secure a reasonable deal now.
* **Strategic Offer:** Offering slightly more than half to himself  might entice Alice to accept, especially since she doesn't face inflation. The ""generous"" tone is a negotiation tactic to make the offer seem more appealing."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The tables have turned, Bob. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Impact:** With each round, the deal gets worse for Bob.  Accepting 4500 now is better than risking getting even less in future rounds. 
* **Alice's Position:** Her ""final offer"" statement suggests she's unlikely to budge further.
* **Avoiding the Worst Outcome:**  If Bob rejects this, he'll be making the offer in a round where the money is worth even less to him, potentially leading to an even worse outcome."
