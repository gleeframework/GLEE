"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Take 1,000 and let's negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000 and keeping $9,000 for myself. This is a relatively small amount for Bob, so he may want to negotiate for more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not giving away too much yet. 
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $8,000 is worth 90% of the original $9,000 I proposed, which is $8,100. Bob's gain of $2,000 is worth 80% of the original $1,000, which is $1,600.

I'm not too thrilled about this offer, but it's a decent compromise. I'll accept this offer.
