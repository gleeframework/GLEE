Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:** While my potential gains are worth less due to inflation, Bob's offer still provides a significant amount of money. 
* **Risk:**  Rejecting this offer means risking getting less in future rounds.  There's no guarantee I'll get a better deal.
* **Time Limit:** With only 10 rounds remaining, the time pressure is significant.

**This offer is the most advantageous for me in the short term.**  While I'd ideally get more, it's a safer bet than waiting for a possible better offer."
