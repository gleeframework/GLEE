This offer heavily favors Alice. I'm willing to negotiate, but not from such an uneven starting point."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm aiming for a more equitable split. This offer reflects the time pressure on you due to the faster inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, this is a good deal for both 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice's offer is getting closer to a fairer split, but it's still skewed in her favor, especially considering the faster rate of inflation impacting my potential gains."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Time is running out!  This offer is a good compromise considering the inflation we both face.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Middle ground, considering the time pressure on both 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice's offer is still  unacceptable. While she acknowledges the time pressure, her proposed split doesn't reflect the significantly faster rate at which inflation eats into my share. I need to push for a more equitable solution."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's be realistic, Alice.  The deal needs to be fair to both of us or we both lose. I propose a 50/50 split.""}"
