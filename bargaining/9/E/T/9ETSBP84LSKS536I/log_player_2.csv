"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split the money almost equally, with a slight advantage for me to start the game. 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While it's tempting to accept a nearly even split, remembering the inflation factor makes it worthwhile to reject and see what Alice offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I propose a slightly different split, reflecting the inflation that will occur in the next round. This ensures we both get a fair share.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems like we're headed for a stalemate. Let's stop wasting time and split the money equally. This is the fairest outcome for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I would have preferred a slightly larger share, the inflation makes accepting Alice's offer the most logical choice.  It ensures I get a good chunk of the money and avoids the risk of further inflation in subsequent rounds."
