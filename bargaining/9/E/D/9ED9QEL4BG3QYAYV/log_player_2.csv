"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5800,
""alice_gain"": 4200,
""message"": ""I think we can find a solution that benefits us both more in the long run, Alice. Here's a new offer."" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Impact:** It's crucial to reach an agreement quickly because the value of the money decreases for Bob with each round. 
* **Fairness:** While Alice's initial offer might seem fair on the surface, Bob understands that time is literally money for him in this scenario.  
* **Negotiation:** Offering 5800 to himself and 4200 to Alice is a strong opening move. It represents a significant gain for Bob compared to the initial offer but is still a reasonable proposal for Alice. 
* **Message Tone:**  The message aims to maintain a collaborative and positive tone, emphasizing finding a ""win-win"" solution."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is literally money for you! Let's be reasonable and end this. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Pressure Tactic:** Alice is trying to use the inflation against me, but her offer is still not significantly better than her first one.
* **Holding Strong:** I need to show Alice that I'm serious about getting a larger share, even with the inflation working against me. 
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  There's a chance Alice might be willing to offer slightly more in the next round to avoid further inflation penalties for me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Alice, let's wrap this up. This offer gets us both a decent amount and avoids further losses due to inflation."" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  Every round is costing Bob money due to the inflation. It's becoming increasingly important to reach a deal quickly.
* **Strategic Compromise:** This offer is a step down from Bob's previous offer, showing a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Appealing to Logic:** The message directly addresses the time pressure and emphasizes the mutual benefit of closing the deal now. 
* **Avoiding a Loss:** By offering 5200, Bob is still getting more than Alice's last offer, even after the inflation is factored in. He needs to secure a win before the decreasing value makes it impossible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Accept this offer before inflation eats away at your potential gains even further! 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Desperate Times:** The inflation has become incredibly severe. Accepting 3500 now is better than risking even less in subsequent rounds.
* **Alice's Strong Position:**  Alice knows Bob is under immense pressure, and her offer reflects that. She's unlikely to offer anything better at this point.
* **Cutting Losses:** It's painful to accept such a low offer, but continuing to hold out could result in an even worse outcome for Bob. It's time to salvage what he can."
