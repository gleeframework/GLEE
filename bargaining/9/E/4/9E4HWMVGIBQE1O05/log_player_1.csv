"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

I'm offering a 50-50 split, which seems fair to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $4000 is worth $4000 / 0.9 = $4444.44 in the first round's value, and Bob's gain of $6000 is worth $6000 / 0.8 = $7500 in the first round's value.

I think this offer is a bit biased towards Bob, but I'll consider it. I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll make a new offer. I'll try to balance the gain between us.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500
}
```

This time, I'm offering a slightly higher amount to Bob, hoping to make it more appealing to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the value of the gains in the first round's value. My gain of $3500 is worth $3500 / 0.271 = $12,900.49, and Bob's gain of $6500 is worth $6500 / 0.482 = $13,445.41.

This offer seems to be heavily biased towards Bob, and I'm not willing to accept it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the value of the gains in the first round's value. My gain of $2500 is worth $2500 / 0.5217 = $4,788.13, and Bob's gain of $7500 is worth $7500 / 0.7903 = $9,504.13.

This offer is still biased towards Bob, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of the inflation. I'll think carefully before making a decision.
