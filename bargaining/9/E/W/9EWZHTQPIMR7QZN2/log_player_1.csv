I propose to take 95% of the money and leave 5% for Bob. This is a fairly generous offer considering I'm taking into account the potential for inflation."

I'm still holding out for a better deal. Bob is starting to feel the pinch of inflation too, and I think he'll eventually come around."

Round 7

I'm still going to reject.  Bob's offer is getting closer, but I think I can still do better, especially with the amount of inflation we're both facing."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}

We're running out of time, and the inflation is really starting to hurt.  I'm taking a big step down in my offer, hoping Bob will finally accept. This is my final offer before the value of the money becomes negligible."
