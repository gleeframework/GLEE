Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with this""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a fair starting point. Let's see if Bob accepts!"

# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about giving up 30, but I'm willing to consider it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'd like to make a counteroffer."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll aim for a slightly more aggressive split. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20, ""message"": ""I'll take the majority, but it's still a good deal for you""}

Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this one!"

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent chunk, but I'm not giving up too much 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the money is really losing value fast! With the money worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'm getting a bit desperate. But I'm still not willing to give up too much.

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll take Bob's offer this time. 75 is a decent chunk, and I'm not sure if I can do better in the next round."
