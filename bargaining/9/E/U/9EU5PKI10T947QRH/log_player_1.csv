"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}

I'm starting with a fair split, 50/50."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'll think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not concerned about the inflation on my end.

However, I'm not sure if I want to give Bob a larger share. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a new offer that takes into account the inflation and the fact that Bob is looking for a larger share.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500
}

I'm giving Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm not willing to give up too much."
