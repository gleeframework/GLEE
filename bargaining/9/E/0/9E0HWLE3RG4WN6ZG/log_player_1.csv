"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair to start with. Now it's Bob's turn!"

Since the money is worth 30.17% less for Bob, he's getting a smaller share than in the previous round. I'm starting to think that Bob is trying to wear me down with a series of similar offers.

However, I'm not getting any younger, and the money is worth less and less with each passing round. I think I'll take this offer and call it a day.
