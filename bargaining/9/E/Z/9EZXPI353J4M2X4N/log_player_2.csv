"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer gives me a slight advantage, but you'll still get a good chunk! 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is decent, the game has just started and it's worth seeing if I can negotiate a better deal for myself.  I'll see what Alice proposes in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Let's split the money more evenly. I'm willing to give you a slight advantage, but I'd like to get a fair share as well.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's meet in the middle. This is a fair split considering the inflation is hitting me harder. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice's offer is better than what I could have gotten in the last round, and the inflation will continue to hurt both of us. It's time to secure what I can."
