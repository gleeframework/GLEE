"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'm willing to give you a small share, but I'm hoping to get a good chunk for myself.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the money and Bob gets 20%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finish the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm looking for a fair split, let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is biting already!

Considering the offer, I'll have to think carefully. If I accept this offer, I'll get 50% of the money, but since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll actually get 40% of the original amount.

I'll decide to reject this offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round.
