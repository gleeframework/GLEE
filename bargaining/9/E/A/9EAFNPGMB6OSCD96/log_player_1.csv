"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
I'm starting with a proposal that heavily favors me. I'm hoping Bob will accept it, as it's a good starting point. If he doesn't, I'll have to adjust my offer in the following rounds to account for the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my initial proposal. While I don't want to risk getting nothing, I'm not willing to accept such a drastic reduction in my share. I'll see what I can do to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40} 
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to account for Bob's inflation.  I'm hoping this will be more appealing to him, but I'm still aiming for a fair share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is still not ideal, but considering the inflation and the fact that we only have 8 rounds left, accepting this offer seems like the most reasonable choice.  I'm taking a significant hit, but at least I'm getting something."
