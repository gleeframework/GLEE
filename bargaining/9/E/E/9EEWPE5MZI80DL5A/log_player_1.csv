"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

This is a 50/50 split, which seems fair to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, my gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, so I'm actually gaining 4000 * 0.8 = 3200 dollars. Bob's gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, so he's gaining 6000 * 0.9 = 5400 dollars.

I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In this round, my gain is worth 20% less than in the previous round, so I'll aim to get a higher share to compensate for the inflation. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","To calculate my gain, I'll multiply the amount by 0.516 (1 - 0.484, since 100% - 48.8% = 51.2% remaining value). So, my gain would be 5800 * 0.516 = 2988 dollars.

To calculate Bob's gain, I'll multiply the amount by 0.727 (1 - 0.273, since 100% - 27.1% = 72.9% remaining value). So, Bob's gain would be 4200 * 0.727 = 3054 dollars.

I'll accept this offer.
