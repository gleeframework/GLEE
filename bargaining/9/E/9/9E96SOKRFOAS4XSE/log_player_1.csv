"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. I'm framing it as a fair split, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, you can have a small share 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my $6,000 is now worth $4,800.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about taking only $2,000, but it's better than going to the next round. I'll accept his offer.
