"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money evenly. It's fair and simple. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While a 50/50 split seems fair on the surface, the game's inflation mechanic makes rejecting and proposing a slightly more favorable deal for Bob a better strategy. Since the money will be worth less in each round, there's a strong incentive to delay and attempt to secure a larger share for himself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's switch the roles this time, I think a 60/40 split is fair considering the game's mechanics.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation effect, let's adjust our shares accordingly. This way, we maintain a fair division. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation is hitting Bob harder:**  Bob's potential gains are decreasing rapidly due to inflation, while Alice's are relatively less impacted.
* **Alice's offer is slightly more favorable:** Even though it's not a 50/50 split, it's a significant improvement compared to the previous round. The 475,000 for Bob is more than the 400,000 he would have received if he had accepted in Round 1.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to reject offers might lead to a better deal in the future, but the risk of inflation eroding the value of the money is too high. Accepting this offer minimizes the loss from inflation and guarantees a substantial sum."
