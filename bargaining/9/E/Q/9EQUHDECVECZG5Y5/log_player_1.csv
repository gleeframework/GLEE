"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm offering to split the money evenly, 50/50, to get a decent starting point and see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it... 

Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, I'll have to consider that when making my decision. I'll have to weigh the potential gain of 4000 dollars (which is actually 4000 * 0.9 = 3600 dollars in value to me) against the risk of waiting for a potentially better offer.

I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my next offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500}
```

I'm increasing my share slightly, hoping to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth less to me now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is really taking a toll on me now! My gain of 3000 dollars is actually worth 3000 * 0.729 = 2187 dollars to me.

Considering the offer, I think I'll have to take it. The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, and I don't want to risk waiting for a potentially worse offer.

I'll accept this offer.
