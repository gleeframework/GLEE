"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10} 
```

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  I'm hoping Bob will accept this, as it's a pretty good deal for him considering the inflation risk.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. While 10 dollars is something, it's significantly less than my initial offer. I'm confident that I can get a better deal, especially with the knowledge that the money is worth less with each passing round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20} 
```

I'm going to offer a more balanced split this time, with 80 for me and 20 for Bob. This is still a good deal for me, considering the inflation, and I think it's a fair offer that Bob might be more likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is still not good enough for me. Even though the money is worth less, I'm still confident I can get a better deal. I'm going to stick to my strategy of offering a fair, but slightly more favorable, split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30} 
```

I'm going to offer 70 for me and 30 for Bob. The inflation is really starting to bite, so I need to secure a decent amount for myself.  This is still a generous offer considering the circumstances. Let's see if Bob is more receptive this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is still not good enough.  While the inflation is taking its toll, I'm holding out hope for a better deal.  I think I can get a better split if I continue to propose a fair deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40} 
```

I'm going to offer 60 for me and 40 for Bob. The inflation is really hitting hard now, but I'm still aiming for a fair split.  It's time for Bob to start compromising, or we both risk getting nothing."
