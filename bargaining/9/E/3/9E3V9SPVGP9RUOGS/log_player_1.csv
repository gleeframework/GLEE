I'm going to start with a very lopsided offer. Since we don't know how inflation affects Bob, I want to maximize my potential gain.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

This is still a ridiculous offer, and I'm not going to accept it.  I know I'm not getting much in this round due to inflation, but I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

I'm going to stick with my original strategy.  Bob seems to be playing aggressively, but I'm hoping he'll realize that it's better to get a small amount now than to risk getting nothing at all in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still going to reject this offer.  While the inflation is definitely making things harder, I'm confident that I can get a better deal if I keep playing.  I'm hoping Bob will start to see that he's not gaining much by holding out for a perfect deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

I'm sticking to my strategy of offering a highly lopsided deal in my favor. I'm hoping that Bob will start to realize the value of even a small amount of money, especially as inflation continues to erode his gains."
