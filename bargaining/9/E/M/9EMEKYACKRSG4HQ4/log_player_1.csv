Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'll start by offering Bob a small share, hoping he'll accept and we can get this over with quickly.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more money, I'm taking a big hit from inflation. It's better to accept this offer and get something than risk getting nothing at all."
