Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 40% of the money. You can either accept or make a counteroffer.""

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable for the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
