"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 70-30, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, giving me the larger share, but still a reasonable offer for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try 40-60, a good compromise 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation, my gain is now worth 56 (0.8 x 70).

I'll think about Bob's offer...

I'll reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with the 40-60 split, I want a better share!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, my gain is now worth 44.8 (0.8 x 56).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, 55-45""
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise that's closer to the original 70-30 split, but still reasonable for Bob."
