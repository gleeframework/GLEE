"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

This offer ensures the highest possible gain for Alice in the first round, while still leaving a small portion for Bob.  The hope is that Bob will accept, as any further rounds could lead to a loss for him due to the unknown inflation factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer ensures I get at least half the money. There's no guarantee that Bob will offer me a better deal in the next round, and the inflation could affect my gains negatively. A 50/50 split is a fair compromise, and it's better than risking getting nothing."
