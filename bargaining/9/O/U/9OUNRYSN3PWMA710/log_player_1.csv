"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe a 60/40 split is fair considering the decreasing value of money. It allows us both to get a good share before the value erodes further. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
