"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering the inflation we're facing. Let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```
Reason: While Bob's offer is closer to a fair split considering the inflation, it still heavily favors him. I'm willing to negotiate, but not to the point where I'm losing a significant amount of potential earnings."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
