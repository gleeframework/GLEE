"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's be a little more reasonable. I'm willing to come down to 60/40, but I'm not going any lower.  Let's avoid more inflation and get this done. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is better, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  The inflation is hurting me more than her, but I need to hold out for a better deal. Accepting now would be letting her take advantage of the situation."
