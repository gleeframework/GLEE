"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'm willing to give you a decent amount to get us moving.""
}
```

This offer gives me 90% of the initial amount, which is $900,000, and leaves Bob with $100,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer to get us started!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's a fair start. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less now, my gain of $500,000 is actually worth $400,000.

I'll reject this offer because I'd like to get a larger share. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less again, my offer from Round 1 would be worth $720,000 now. I'll make a new offer that takes this into account:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you a smaller share, but I'm still aiming for a decent amount.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bigger share, but I need more than 300k to keep up with inflation. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 48.8% less now, my gain of $600,000 is actually worth $312,000.

I'll accept this offer because it's a significant improvement from Bob's previous offer, and I'm getting a larger share of the remaining money. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
