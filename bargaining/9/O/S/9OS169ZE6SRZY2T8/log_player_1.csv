"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 900000,
""bob_gain"": 100000,
""message"": ""Let's make a deal. This offer benefits you greatly considering the inflation.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Exploiting Inflation:** Bob's money loses value quickly.  A generous offer now might be better than a slightly better offer later in his eyes.
* **First Mover Advantage:**  Setting a high initial offer anchors the negotiation. Even if Bob rejects it, he'll likely be working within a framework where I get a significant portion. 
* **Appearing Reasonable:** The message aims to make Bob feel like I'm offering a good deal rather than trying to exploit him from the start. This might lead to faster acceptance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the impact of inflation, this offer aims to find a middle ground that benefits both of us. It's a significant compromise on my part, showing my willingness to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice gain: 750000 
# Bob gain: 250000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's message tries to sound reasonable, his offer is actually quite unfavorable to me. He's only reduced his share by a small amount, despite the fact that the value of the money is decreasing rapidly for him. 

By rejecting, I put the pressure back on Bob. He'll be even more motivated to make a better offer in the next round, knowing that the value of his potential winnings is shrinking."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 850000,
""bob_gain"": 150000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. The value of this deal diminishes significantly for you with each round. This offer ensures you get something substantial. Time is literally money!""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Stance:** I'm slightly reducing my demand to show a willingness to negotiate, but not by much. This maintains a strong position.
* **Highlighting Time Pressure:** My message emphasizes the urgency for Bob. He's losing potential profit with every passing round, and I want to make sure he understands that. 
* **Balancing Act:** This offer still heavily favors me, but the slight decrease from my initial offer might make Bob feel like he's getting a concession and encourage him to accept."
