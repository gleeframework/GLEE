"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

This is my first offer. I am aiming for the majority of the money, but still leaving Bob with a small amount to hopefully make him consider accepting. I believe it's a fair offer considering the potential for inflation in the future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more, accepting Bob's offer is the best strategy at this point.  The inflation means my share is worth less, and if I reject, I risk getting even less in future rounds."
