"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, Bob. I get a bit more since I'm making the first offer. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm Bob, and I want to maximize my share. While a 450,000$ gain is good, I'm hoping to get more. I'll see what Alice proposes in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I think it's fair for me to receive a slightly larger share, considering we're both taking a risk by rejecting the first offer.  What do you say?""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's meet in the middle. This is a bit closer to even, but still acknowledges the time pressure. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice is getting closer to my target, but I still think I can get a better deal. I'm going to keep rejecting until we reach a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 520000,
""alice_gain"": 480000,
""message"": ""Alice, I understand the pressure is mounting. How about we split the difference this time?  I'm willing to concede a bit, but I still believe this is a fair outcome given the risk we're both taking.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. We're losing money with every passing round. I'm offering a slight edge, but we need to close this deal now! 
# Bob gain: 490000 
# Alice gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I still prefer a larger share, I acknowledge that the pressure is high and the value of the money is dwindling rapidly.  Accepting this offer is the best way to secure a decent profit before the remaining value is eroded even further."
