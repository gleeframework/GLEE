"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

This is a 50-50 split, which seems fair to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it... 

Since Bob's offer is 60-40 in his favor, I'd rather try to negotiate for a better deal. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With the inflation in mind, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

This is a 55-45 split, which is a bit more favorable to me, but still reasonable. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is catching up quickly! With the money worth 14.26% less for Bob, this offer seems more reasonable. I'll accept this offer.
