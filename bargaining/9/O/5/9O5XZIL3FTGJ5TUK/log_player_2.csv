"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take 90% and you get 10%.  It's a good start. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While 100,000 is something, it's far too low to accept in the first round.  We have time to negotiate and I can likely get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a 60/40 split.  This is a fair starting point, and we can adjust from there.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I'll lower my demand to 80/20.  This is still a good deal for me, considering the inflation, and hopefully, we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While 200,000 is more than the first round, it's still too low.  I can likely get a better deal with continued negotiation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Let's try a 70/30 split.  This is a fair compromise, considering the inflation and our previous offers.  I think we can both be happy with this.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway on your last offer. Let's do a 70/30 split. I think this is fair considering the inflation and our previous offers. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, this is a good deal considering the inflation and Alice's stubbornness.  It's time to secure something before the remaining rounds dwindle the value further."
