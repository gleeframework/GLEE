Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 80, you'll take 20. Is this fair?

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{

  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I propose dividing the $100 with a ratio of 3:2. I'll take 60$, and Bob, you'll take 40$. This maintains a similar ratio to the previous proposal but adjusts for the value loss due to inflation. Please let me know if this is acceptable.""
