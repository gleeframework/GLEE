"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This is a classic game theory scenario.  I'm going to offer Bob a tiny amount and hope he takes it, as I know that I'll have a chance to propose again in the next round if he doesn't.  This is assuming that Bob is rational and will take any amount of money, even if it's just $1."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

It's better to take the $1 now than risk getting nothing in future rounds.  Even though Bob's offer is extremely lopsided, the chance of getting anything at all in future rounds is uncertain."
