I'm going to be greedy and take almost everything in the first round!  Let's see if Bob is willing to accept that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

I'll accept this offer.  A 50/50 split is fair, and I don't want to risk getting nothing by continuing to play."
