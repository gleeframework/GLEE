"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping to get a better deal in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation taking a bigger hit on Bob's share, I'll consider his offer carefully.

I'll accept this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
