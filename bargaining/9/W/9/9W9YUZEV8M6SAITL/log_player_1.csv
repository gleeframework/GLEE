I'm going for a big share in the first round, hoping Bob will be tempted to accept to avoid the risk of inflation.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I'd like more money, the inflation is a real threat.  The money I'd gain is worth less than in the first round, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer. It's time to take what I can get."
