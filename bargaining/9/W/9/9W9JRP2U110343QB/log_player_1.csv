This is a tough one! Here's why I decided to accept:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is decreasing rapidly. Waiting any longer means a smaller pot for both of us.
* **Bob's Shifting Position:** Bob went from offering 6000 to 5500.  This suggests he's feeling the pressure of the shrinking pot and might be willing to negotiate further in another round, but the loss from inflation might outweigh any potential gains. 
* **""Reasonable"" Offer:** While not ideal, getting 4500 is better than risking an even lower offer in round 5, especially considering the money will be worth even less then. 

It's a gamble either way, but accepting now locks in a somewhat reasonable amount."
