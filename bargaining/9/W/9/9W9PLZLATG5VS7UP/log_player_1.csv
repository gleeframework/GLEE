Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5, ""message"": ""Let's start fair. I'll take 95, and you get 5. It's a good deal for you, considering the inflation we'll have to deal with later.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we should be fair. Since you offered to take 95 last round, I'll take 95 this round. Let's see how this inflation plays out! 
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
