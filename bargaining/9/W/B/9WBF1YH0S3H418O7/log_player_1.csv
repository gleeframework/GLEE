"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a good balance""}

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40. I think this is a fair starting point, considering we're both starting from scratch."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, no need to be greedy 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too thrilled about the inflation, but I'll consider Bob's offer.

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I think meeting in the middle is a good idea, and $50 each is a reasonable compromise. It's not the best deal I could have gotten, but it's better than going back to the negotiation table."
