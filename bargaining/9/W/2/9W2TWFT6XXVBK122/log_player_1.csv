"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly!""}\n\n###\n\nI'm being generous with my first offer, but I'm also keeping in mind that the value of the money doesn't decrease for me. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable offer and accept it, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, but let's make it snappy. The clock is ticking! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the value of the money doesn't decrease for me, I can afford to be a bit more patient and wait for a better offer. Considering Bob's offer is not significantly better for me than my initial offer was for him, and he's trying to create a sense of urgency, I'll decide to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nLet's proceed to the next round and see if we can reach a more favorable agreement!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nSince Bob tried to rush me in the previous round, I'll make a slightly more conservative offer this time. I'll also remind him that time is not on his side, as the value of the money keeps decreasing for him.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""No need to rush, let's think this through!""}\n\nLet's see how Bob reacts to this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Okay, Alice, let's stop wasting time.  50/50 is fair and we both lose out the longer this goes on. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Now we're getting somewhere! Bob is finally willing to offer a 50/50 split. Considering the value of the money remains the same for me, and Bob is losing value with each passing round, I think this is a reasonable offer. I'll accept it and end the game here.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nIt's a fair deal, and I'm happy to walk away with $50!"
