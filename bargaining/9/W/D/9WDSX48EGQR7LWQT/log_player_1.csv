"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, which is a relatively small share, but I think it's a fair price for his share of the $1,000,000. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can wrap up the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slight adjustment to the previous offer, let's see if this one sticks! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money has decreased due to inflation!

Considering Bob's new offer, I'm not thrilled about giving him a larger share, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept his offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

It seems like Bob has made a slight adjustment to his previous offer, and I'm willing to accept this new deal."
