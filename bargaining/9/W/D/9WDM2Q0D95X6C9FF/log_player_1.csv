"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you get 40%""
}
```

Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair split, but I'll take a slightly bigger share 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money is worth 20% less, the actual amounts are:
Alice gain: 5000 / 0.8 = 6250
Bob gain: 5000 / 0.8 = 6250

I think this is a fair split, considering the reduced value of the money. I'll accept the offer.
