"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money 60/40. It's a fair offer considering the decreasing value over time. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I'm going to try to get a better deal for myself.  I'll see if I can negotiate a higher share in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""I'm taking into account the decreasing value of the money, but I think a 65/35 split is more fair.  Let's finish this quickly.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. I understand your position, but 65/35 is too greedy considering the inflation. I'm offering 62/38. Let's close the deal and avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 38 
# Alice gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, I don't want to risk losing even more money due to inflation.  I'll take the 38."
