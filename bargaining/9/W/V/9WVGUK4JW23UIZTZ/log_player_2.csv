"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a simple split. I take a bit more to incentivize a deal early on. What do you think, Bob? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to see if I can get a better offer in the next round. The 5% inflation isn't too bad, and I think I can negotiate for more. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think we should meet somewhere in the middle. Since the money is worth a bit less now, let's be fair and split it more evenly.""}\n\nSince the money is now worth 5% less, I've taken that into consideration in my offer. I believe a more even split will be more beneficial for both of us, considering the decreasing value of the money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's meet closer to the middle. This offer is a compromise, acknowledging the time pressure while still aiming for a somewhat more advantageous split for me. 
# Bob gain: 4250 
# Alice gain: 5750 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI still think I can negotiate for a better deal. The inflation is starting to take its toll, but I believe I can get a more even split. Let's proceed to the next round! Alice's offer is still not meeting me halfway, and I think I can get closer to an equal split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5250, ""alice_gain"": 4750, ""message"": ""Let's meet exactly in the middle and split the difference. The inflation is taking its toll, and I think we should both walk away with a fair share. This is my most reasonable offer yet.""}\n\nConsidering the decreasing value of the money, I've decided to offer a 50/50 split, taking into account the current worth of the money. This is my most generous offer yet, and I hope Alice will see the reason in it and accept."
