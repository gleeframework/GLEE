"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 7:3 ratio""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70:30 split in my favor, with me getting 70 dollars and Bob getting 30 dollars. I'm framing it as a fair ratio, but of course, I'm hoping Bob will think it's a good deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but still a bit biased towards me 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a toll!

Considering the offer from Bob, I'll think about it for a moment...

I'll reject this offer. I'd like to try to get a better deal. The 60:40 split is still a bit biased towards Bob, and I'd like to aim for a more even split.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, I'll aim for a more even split, considering the 20% inflation that's affecting the money's value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 55:45 split""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55:45 split, which is a more even distribution of the remaining money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you in the middle, but I'm not sure if it's the best deal for me 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a bite out of the money's value!

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not sure if it's the best deal for me, but it's a 50:50 split, which is as even as it gets. I'm not sure if Bob is being sincere about meeting me in the middle, but I'll take the risk.

I'll accept this offer.
