"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth less, I'd like to try to get a better deal. Bob's offer is still quite lopsided, and I'm not sure I'm comfortable with it.

I'll reject the offer and try to make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more than 40%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42-58 split, with me getting $420,000 and Bob getting $580,000. This is a more balanced split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging, I think I deserve the majority of the pie 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the significant inflation, the money is worth much less than it was initially. I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the huge disparity in the split, especially since the money is worth less.

I'll reject the offer and try to make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 360000,
  ""bob_gain"": 640000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I still think 60-40 is a fair split""
}
```

I'm proposing a 36-64 split, with me getting $360,000 and Bob getting $640,000. This is a more balanced split than Bob's previous offer, and I'm hoping he'll accept it."
