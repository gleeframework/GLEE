Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm willing to make one more deal. Considering the inflation is affecting you more, I think this is a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Although not ideal, accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:** The value of the money is decreasing significantly for me (Alice) with each round. Waiting any longer will only result in a worse deal.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Holding out for a slightly better offer in a future round isn't worth the risk of the money losing even more value. 
* **Bob's Stance:** Bob knows I'm feeling the pressure of inflation and is unlikely to offer anything significantly better in future rounds.

While 4200 is less than desired, it's better to secure that amount now than risk getting even less later."
