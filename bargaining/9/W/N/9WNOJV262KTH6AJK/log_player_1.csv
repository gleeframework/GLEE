"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair and simple start!""}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, giving me 600,000 and Bob 400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a 7/3 split, a slight lean towards me, but still fair 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not too thrilled about the 7/3 split, and Bob is getting a much bigger share than me. I think I can do better than that. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I'll meet you halfway, 45/55 split. A compromise that's closer to fair.""}

I'm proposing a 45/55 split, giving me 450,000 and Bob 550,000."
