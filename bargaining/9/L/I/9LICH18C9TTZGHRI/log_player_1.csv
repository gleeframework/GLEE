Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```

  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 20% of the total.""

# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my potential gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to decide whether to accept it or reject it.
