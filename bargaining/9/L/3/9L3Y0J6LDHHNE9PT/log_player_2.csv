"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. 60/40 seems fair. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see if I can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""I think a 65/35 split is more fair, considering the potential for inflation. What do you think?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. This is the last round where my offer is higher than your initial one after inflation. I'm willing to settle for 550,000, but that's my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer more, it's better to take what I can get before the next round diminishes the value further."
