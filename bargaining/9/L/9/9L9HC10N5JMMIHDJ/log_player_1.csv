"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a better deal, but you have to meet me halfway 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

After considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not convinced that a 70-30 split is a good deal for me, especially since my money is worth the same as in the first round. I'd like to try to negotiate further to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and split it 50-50, it's a fair compromise""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which I think is a fair compromise considering the game has gone on for two rounds and we've both had to adjust for inflation."
