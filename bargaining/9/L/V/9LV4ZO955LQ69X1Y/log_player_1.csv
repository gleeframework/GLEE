"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'll have to consider the reduced value of the money.

Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll calculate the actual value of the money:

My gain: 500,000 * 0.95 = 475,000
Bob's gain: 500,000 * 0.9 = 450,000

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, considering the reduced value of the money. I'll reject the offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm offering to take a slightly smaller share, 55% of the initial $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 45%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'll calculate the actual value of the money:

My gain: 450,000 * 0.855 (1 - 0.145) = 382,750
Bob's gain: 550,000 * 0.727 (1 - 0.273) = 400,135

Considering the reduced value of the money, I think this is a good deal for me. I'll accept the offer.
