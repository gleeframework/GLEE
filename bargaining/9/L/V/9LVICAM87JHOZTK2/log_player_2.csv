"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a more aggressive offer since I rejected Alice's initial offer. Here's my proposal:

{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 580000 
# Alice gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effects of inflation, I think I'll take Alice's offer this time. It's a decent split, and I don't want to risk going to another round with even lower potential gains.
