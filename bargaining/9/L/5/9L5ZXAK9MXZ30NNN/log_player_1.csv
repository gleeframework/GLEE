"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60/40 split in my favor, as the money is now worth less due to inflation.  This is a fair compromise after your initial offer. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
