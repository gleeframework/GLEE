I'm not accepting this offer. Although Bob's offer is getting much better for him due to the inflation penalty on his end, I'm still better off rejecting and holding out for a better offer. I believe I can still get a larger share in the next round."

I'm still rejecting this offer. Even though the inflation penalty on Bob is getting steeper, my goal is to get a larger share of the money. I believe I can still negotiate a more favorable deal in the remaining rounds."

At this point, the inflation is really starting to hurt Bob. I'm offering a 50/50 split, which is much better for him than his previous offers.  I think this is the best way to secure a deal and get something out of this game."
