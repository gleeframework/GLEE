"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's divide fairly, considering the inflation rate difference 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This offer is not favorable in the long run, as Alice gets a much larger share despite the inflation difference.  We need to negotiate a fairer split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I propose a 55/45 split. This takes into account the inflation difference, and allows us both to get a significant share.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the increased inflation impact on your end, I'm willing to adjust, but I still believe I deserve the larger share. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While the offer is slightly better for me than the first round, it's still not a fair reflection of the inflation impact. I need a significantly larger share to compensate for the substantial devaluation of my gains."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""We need to compromise to avoid losing even more to inflation. I'm proposing a 60/40 split. This reflects the growing impact of inflation on my share, while still giving you a substantial portion.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is hurting us both, but I still think my share should be higher. Willing to meet in the middle, but need a better compromise. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

The inflation is drastically affecting my gains. While Alice's offer is a slight improvement, it's still not enough to compensate for the massive devaluation of my share.  I need a more equitable split to make this worthwhile."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""We're approaching a point where we'll both lose significantly more to inflation.  I'm proposing a 65/35 split, which is the most I can offer while still making it worthwhile for me given the inflation impact.""}
