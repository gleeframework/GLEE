Let's see if Bob is happy with an 90/10 split.  I'm aiming for a good chunk of the money, but I'm also trying to be fair enough that Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is much fairer than my previous proposal, and with inflation kicking in, I don't want to risk getting nothing at all.  Let's take the 50/50 split!"
