"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm leaving it up to Bob to decide whether to accept or make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering I'm taking the risk of proposing first. Let's see what you think. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% decrease in value due to inflation, my gain of $4000 is actually worth $3200 in real terms.

I'm not convinced by Bob's argument that he's taking a risk by proposing first, since I still have the opportunity to make a counteroffer. I think I can do better than this.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation has reduced the value of the money, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreased value.

Since the money is worth 20% less than the previous round, I'll aim for a higher proportion of the remaining value. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly higher share, but I still think I deserve more. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if he rejects it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's compromise. I'll take a smaller share than my previous offer, but I still need a bit more than your last proposal. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the continued inflation, the value of the money has decreased significantly. My gain of $4500 is now worth $2,310 in real terms.

Considering the decreased value, I think Bob's offer is a bit more reasonable, but I'm still not convinced that I'm getting a fair share. I'll think about it for a moment...

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation continuing to erode the value of the money, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the further decreased value.

Since my gain is worth 48.8% less than the first round, I'll aim for an even higher proportion of the remaining value. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I need to make up for the lost value due to inflation. Let's see if you'll accept this offer!""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if he rejects it!"
