"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer to divide the $1,000,000 and a message to Bob in JSON format:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly, considering my offer will be worth less each round""
}
```

In this offer, I, Alice, propose to take $550,000, leaving $450,000 for Bob. My message aims to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness, highlighting the impact of inflation on the value of the money with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's only fair to split it more evenly, as my offer will be worth less each round. Let's make this quick! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer to divide the $1,000,000 and a message to Bob in JSON format:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, this is a more reasonable split. Let's settle before it's too late!""
}
```

In this offer, I've adjusted the amounts to try to find a middle ground, taking into account the decreasing value of the money due to inflation. My message conveys a sense of urgency to settle the deal before the value of the money drops further."
