Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

This seems like a fair starting point, given that you're getting the bigger share in the first round. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is a clear power move, taking advantage of the inflation to his benefit.  I'll reject this and see if we can reach a more equitable agreement in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
``` 

I'm going to offer a more balanced split in this round, acknowledging Bob's previous offer but trying to get a better share for myself. It's a risky move, but I think it's worth a shot."
