{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting 6000 and Bob getting 4000. This seems like a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."

# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split in my favor is more fair, as the money loses value for me with each round. Let's be efficient! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not willing to accept a 40-60 split in favor of Bob. I think it's too skewed towards him, especially considering the money is losing value for him at a faster rate.

I'm trying to find a middle ground by offering a 55-45 split, with me getting 5500 and Bob getting 4500. This is a bit more favorable to Bob than my initial offer, but I'm hoping it's still reasonable and he'll accept it."

# Bob gain: 7000
