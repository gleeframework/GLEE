"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving each of us $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer...

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, I'd need to adjust my thinking accordingly. Considering the reduced value of my share, I'm not thrilled about accepting an offer that gives Bob a larger share.

I'll reject this offer and hope to do better in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 420000, ""bob_gain"": 580000}

I'm trying to make a slightly more aggressive offer, taking into account the reduced value of the money due to inflation. I'm willing to give Bob a slightly larger share, but still trying to maintain a decent portion for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering the significant reduction in the value of my share, I'm getting a bit desperate. Bob's offer is quite aggressive, but I'm not sure I can do better.

After careful consideration, I'll accept this offer. I'll take the $300,000 and hope that I can do better in future negotiations.
