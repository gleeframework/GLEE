"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair and reasonable start""
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the initial $100, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, let's split it evenly 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the new values are:

* My gain: 50 * 0.8 = 40
* Bob's gain: 50 * 0.9 = 45

I don't think this is a good deal for me, since I'd be getting less than I would have gotten in the first round. I'll reject the offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth even less now, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, I'm not getting any younger""
}
```

This way, I get 70% of the remaining $100, and Bob gets 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, let's find a middle ground 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation:

* My gain: 55 * 0.512 = 28.16
* Bob's gain: 45 * 0.7279 = 32.84

This is a decent offer, considering the reduced value of money. I'll accept it.
