I'm starting with a relatively generous offer to Bob, aiming to secure a deal in the first round.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, I'm taking this offer. The inflation is making the money worth less each round, and with Bob's offer I'm guaranteed to get half the money, which is better than potentially getting nothing if we continue."
