"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'm offering you 40% and keeping 60% for myself. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nReasoning: Since the money is worth 20% less for me in each subsequent round, I should try to maximize my gain in the early rounds. Alice's offer of 40% is not bad, but I can try to negotiate for a better deal. If I reject this offer, I will have the opportunity to make a counteroffer in the next round and potentially get a better share. Additionally, since the money is worth 5% less for Alice in each subsequent round, she may be more willing to compromise in the next round to avoid losing more value. Therefore, I choose to reject this offer and proceed to the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","### Step 1: Determine the current value of the money for both players after the first round.
After the first round, the money is worth 20% less for me (Bob), and 5% less for Alice.

### Step 2: Calculate the adjusted total value of the money for this round.
For me (Bob), the money is now worth 80% of its original value, so the adjusted total is $10,000 * 0.8 = $8,000.
For Alice, the money is now worth 95% of its original value, so the adjusted total is $10,000 * 0.95 = $9,500.

### Step 3: Decide on a fair division considering the adjusted values.
Given the adjusted totals, a fair division would be based on the average of the adjusted values for both players. However, since the goal is to maximize my gain while being reasonable, I will propose a division that slightly favors me but is still attractive to Alice.

### Step 4: Calculate the proposed division.
Considering the adjusted values, I propose that I (Bob) receive 45% of the original $10,000 (which is now worth $8,000 to me), and Alice receive 55% (which is now worth $9,500 to her).

### Step 5: Convert the percentages into dollar amounts for the proposal.
For me (Bob), 45% of $10,000 is $4,500.
For Alice, 55% of $10,000 is $5,500.

### Step 6: Formulate a message to accompany the proposal.
""Considering the depreciation of value for both of us, I'm willing to compromise with a 45-55 split, hoping we can find a middle ground.""

### Step 7: Format the proposal and message into the required JSON format.

The final answer is: {""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Considering the depreciation of value for both of us, I'm willing to compromise with a 45-55 split, hoping we can find a middle ground.""}"
