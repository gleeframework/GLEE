"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a high initial offer, hoping Bob will accept. It's a bit risky, but if he doesn't, I'll adjust my strategy for the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though the offer is significantly lower than my initial proposal, it's better than getting nothing in the end.  Inflation is a real threat, and I'm not sure how many rounds I can risk before the money becomes worthless."
