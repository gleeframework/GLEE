I'm going to be greedy in the first round and try to get as much as possible, knowing that the value of the money decreases with each passing round.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob's offer is much more reasonable than mine was, but it's still not fair!  I'm going to reject it, hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

This time I'm proposing an even split. The inflation is starting to become a factor, and I'm not sure if I can get a better deal in the next round. Let's see what Bob decides!"
