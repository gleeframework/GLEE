"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
 
I propose to take 999,000$ and leave 1,000$ for Bob. Since we only have 12 rounds, I want to secure the majority of the money right away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I'd prefer more, taking 100,000$ is better than getting nothing in the end. It's better to accept this offer than risk it all with more rounds."
