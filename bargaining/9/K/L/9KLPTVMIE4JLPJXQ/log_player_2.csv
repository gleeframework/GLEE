Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of inflation more than Bob. While her offer is getting closer to a more even split, it's still beneficial for Bob to hold out a little longer and see if he can secure an even better deal."
