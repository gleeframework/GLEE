"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}

I'm going to start with a somewhat generous offer, keeping in mind that with each round, the money will be worth less. I'll see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though I'm losing a significant portion of the money due to inflation, accepting this offer is the best strategy. If I reject, I'll be the one making the offer in the next round, but the money will be worth even less."
