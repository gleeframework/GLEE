"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair!""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, Alice proposes to take $55 for herself and give $45 to Bob, with a message suggesting fairness. The offer is slightly biased in Alice's favor, but not excessively so, in hopes that Bob will see it as a reasonable starting point for negotiations.\n\nYour turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fairer, but I'm willing to negotiate. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nIn this response, Alice rejects Bob's offer because, despite the message suggesting a willingness to negotiate, the proposed split of $45 for Alice and $55 for Bob does not seem to adequately take into account the impact of inflation on Alice's gain, which is worth 10% less in this round compared to the first. Alice is motivated to continue negotiations to achieve a more favorable split, considering the devaluation of the money she would receive.\n\nYour turn!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet halfway.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, Alice takes into account the effects of inflation from the previous rounds and proposes a division that slightly favors her but is closer to an even split than her initial offer. The message suggests finding a middle ground that considers the devaluation of money for both parties but emphasizes Alice's greater loss to inflation.\n\nYour turn!"
