"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your fairness, Alice, but I believe the value depreciation favors me this round. Let's reverse the split. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer acknowledges the inflation, simply reversing the split from Round 1 isn't beneficial for me in the long run.  The inflation rate works against me significantly more than him. I need to aim for a more favorable split in Round 3 while the value of the money is still substantial."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but the inflation hits me harder. Let's compromise - 55/45 split. This round is crucial for me.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Impact:**  The value of the money is decreasing rapidly. It's vital to secure a reasonable amount this round.
* **Compromise:** Bob seems fixed on getting a larger share. Offering a 55/45 split is a compromise - a slight concession from my original 60/40 proposal.
* **Urgency:** My message highlights the urgency of the situation, emphasizing that this round is critical due to the rapid inflation working against me."
