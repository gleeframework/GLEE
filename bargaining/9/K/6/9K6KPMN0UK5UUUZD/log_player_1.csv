Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, with me taking the larger share this round as I'm the one proposing. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000

{
""alice_gain"": 5500,

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  Each round significantly devalues the money due to the high inflation rates.  It's crucial to reach an agreement quickly.
* **Bob's Position:** Bob seems anchored to the 60/40 split but wants the larger share himself.  This suggests he might be somewhat inflexible.
* **Strong Stance:** By presenting this as my ""final offer,"" I'm creating a sense of urgency and signaling that I'm serious about getting a reasonable deal. 
* **Slight Compromise:** Offering 55/45 is a slight concession from my initial 60/40, making it more palatable for Bob, but still securing me a decent share.

This strategy aims to balance firmness with a touch of compromise to encourage Bob to accept before inflation eats further into our potential gains."
