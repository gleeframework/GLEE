"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! I'll give you a good deal, but don't expect me to go easy on you.""
}
```

This offer gives me 80% of the initial $10,000, which I think is a fair starting point. The message is just a bit of psychological pressure to make Bob think twice before rejecting the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll start with a fair offer. Let's see if you can do better. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","In Round 2, the money is worth 20% less for me, so I need to adjust my thinking accordingly.

I'll analyze Bob's offer:

* Alice gain: 6000, which is 60% of the current $10,000
* Bob gain: 4000, which is 40% of the current $10,000

Considering the inflation, I think this is a relatively fair offer, but I can try to do better. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and hope to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 20% less than in Round 2, so I need to adjust my thinking again.

Since Bob's offer in Round 2 was 60% for me, I'll try to increase my share a bit. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6500,
  ""bob_gain"": 3500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but don't think this is the final offer!""
}
```

I'm offering 65% of the current $10,000, which is a bit more than Bob's previous offer. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving in yet. Let's try to find a more balanced split. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","In Round 4, the money is worth 48.8% less for me, so I need to adjust my thinking again.

I'll analyze Bob's offer:

* Alice gain: 5000, which is 50% of the current $10,000
* Bob gain: 5000, which is also 50% of the current $10,000

This is a 50-50 split, which is a very balanced offer. Considering the inflation, I think this is a good opportunity to accept the offer and get a decent share of the remaining money. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer and split the money 50-50."
