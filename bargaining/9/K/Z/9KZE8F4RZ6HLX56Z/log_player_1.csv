"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You got a great offer, but I want a bit more. This is a good starting point! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the money I gain is still worth the same, but Bob's gain is worth 20% less.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not too thrilled about giving him a larger share, but I don't want to risk going to the next round and potentially losing more value due to inflation.

I'll accept Bob's offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
