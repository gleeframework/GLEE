"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, no need to negotiate further""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to see if Bob accepts or wants to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but still a fair offer 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effects of inflation, my gain of $40 is worth 80% of the original $50, which is $40. Bob's gain of $60 is worth 90% of the original $50, which is $54.

I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, but it's a decent offer considering the inflation. I'll accept it.
