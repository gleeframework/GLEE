"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. It's a good starting point, but I want to see if I can get a better deal.  Let's see what Alice proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly. It's a fair deal for both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle of our two offers 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll accept this offer. While it's not ideal, it's a better outcome than the potential of getting nothing if we keep rejecting offers. The inflation is starting to affect my gains, so I need to be practical."
