"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, which I think is a reasonable starting point for the negotiation. The message ""Let's split fairly"" is an attempt to set a tone of cooperation and fairness, while also slightly favoring myself in the division. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your turn! Let's wrap this up. I'm feeling generous. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, despite the inflation, I believe I can get a better deal. The fact that the money is worth less to both of us now, but more so to Bob, means that I should try to negotiate a larger share to compensate for the loss of value. Bob's message claims he's being generous, but I'm not convinced. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to try to get a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Getting impatient, let's meet in the middle""}\n\nI'm making a slightly more aggressive offer this time, trying to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth less to Bob due to the higher inflation rate on his side. The message ""Getting impatient, let's meet in the middle"" is an attempt to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept the offer, while also framing it as a compromise. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Last chance Alice, take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on the value of the money, I think Bob's offer is reasonable at this point. The fact that the money is worth 27.1% less to Bob than in the first round means that his gain of $5200 is actually worth substantially less to him than it would have been initially. Meanwhile, my gain of $4800 is worth about 14.26% less than it would have been initially, which is still a significant loss, but not as severe as Bob's. Given the decreasing value of the money and Bob's ""take it or leave it"" message, I'm willing to accept this offer rather than risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds."
