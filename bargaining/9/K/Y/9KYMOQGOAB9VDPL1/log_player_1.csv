I'm going to start with a generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept in the first round.  This way, we both get a decent share before the inflation kicks in!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is a very similar offer to the one I proposed. I'll reject it and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

I'm going to increase my share slightly again. Since Bob rejected my first offer, I want to make sure he understands that I'm not afraid to take a larger portion of the money if needed. The inflation is starting to impact us both, so I want to secure a good deal before the value drops even further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation, offering me a much smaller share. I'll reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round. The inflation is impacting both of us, and I'm not going to accept a deal that's so heavily skewed in his favor."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}
```

I'm going to try and secure a good share while accounting for the increasing inflation. I'll offer Bob a slightly larger portion than my previous offer, but I'm still aiming for a significant portion for myself.  Let's see if he's willing to negotiate."
