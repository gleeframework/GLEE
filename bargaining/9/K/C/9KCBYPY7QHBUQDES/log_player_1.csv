"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll have to think carefully about this one...

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with Bob getting a bigger share than me, especially with the inflation factor affecting my end. I'll try to do better next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With the inflation factor in mind, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money.

Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800
}

I'm trying to balance the risk of inflation with the desire to get a slightly larger share."
