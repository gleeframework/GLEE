"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, I need to be more cautious. Since Bob's offer is not a 50-50 split, I'll have to think strategically. If I accept, I'll get $40, which is worth 40% of the original $100 (due to 10% inflation per round). If I reject and proceed to the next round, the money will be worth 90% of its original value, so $100 * 0.9 = $90. In that case, the money I gain will be worth even less.

Considering this, I'll reject the offer and hope for a better deal in the next round.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, I'll make a new proposal for Round 3. Considering the inflation effect, I'll aim for a slightly higher share to compensate for the reduced value of the money.

Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which should give me a slightly higher share to account for the inflation."
