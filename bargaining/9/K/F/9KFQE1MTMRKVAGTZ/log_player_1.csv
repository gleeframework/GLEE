"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a proposal that gives me a decent share while still being fair. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my share is worth even less now.

I'll think about Bob's offer... Hmm, it's a bit more favorable to him than my previous offer, but I'm not thrilled about giving him 60. I'll try to do better next time.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","In round 3, my money is worth 25% less than in round 1, due to cumulative inflation.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
