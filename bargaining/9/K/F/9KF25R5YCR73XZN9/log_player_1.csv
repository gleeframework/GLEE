"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a very lopsided offer. I figure Bob is likely to reject it, but it establishes that I'm willing to take almost everything.  This will hopefully set the stage for a better deal for me in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would have preferred a larger share,  I'm not willing to risk losing more money with inflation.  A 50/50 split is a reasonable outcome."
