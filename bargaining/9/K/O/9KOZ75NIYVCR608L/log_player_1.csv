"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a moderate proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob a decent share, but I'm keeping a slight majority for myself. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting that Bob is mirroring my previous offer, but with the roles reversed.

I'll think for a moment... Since I'm not sure what the inflation rate is for Bob, I'll assume it's a 20% decrease, as mentioned. This means Bob's offer is actually equivalent to 4800 in the first round's value.

I'll accept this offer, as it's a decent compromise, and I don't want to risk losing out on the division of the money.
