Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm going to reject this offer.  While it's a decent amount of money, I want to see if I can get a better deal.  I know the money is worth less each round, but I'm willing to gamble to see if I can get a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000} 
``` 
I'm going to propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  I think this is fair considering the inflation risk, and I'm confident Alice will accept it."
