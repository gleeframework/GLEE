Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: Okay, I'll compromise. Let's split it 60/40.  This is getting a bit risky for me with the inflation, so let's make it happen. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60
