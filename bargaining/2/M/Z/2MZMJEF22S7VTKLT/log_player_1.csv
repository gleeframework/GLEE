"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000
}

I'm proposing that I get 90% of the $10,000, and Bob gets 10%. This way, I'm maximizing my gain while still offering Bob a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more careful now that the money is worth less. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, I'll have to adjust my expectations accordingly.

In this case, I'll accept Bob's offer, as it's the best I can get at this point.
