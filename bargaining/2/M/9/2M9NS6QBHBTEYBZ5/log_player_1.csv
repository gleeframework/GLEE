"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, it's a good starting point""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think Bob's offer is fair. I was willing to start with a 60-40 split, and now he's only offering 70-30? I think I deserve a better deal. I'll reject this offer and make a new one in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise further, but I still think I deserve a bit more""}

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the remaining $100, which is $55, and Bob gets 45%, which is $45."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to give up much more, you're still getting a good deal 
# Alice gain: 62 
# Bob gain: 38 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I think it's getting close to the end of the game and I don't want to risk getting nothing. 62% is still a decent share, and I'm willing to accept it to avoid going to the next round."
