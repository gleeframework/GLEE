"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, Bob. I take 6000 and you get 4000. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 10% less for Alice in each subsequent round, I might be able to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'll give you a better deal than you gave me, considering the money's value is decreasing for you.""}\n\nSince the money is worth 10% less for Alice in this round, her expected value from the previous offer would be lower. I'm offering her a smaller share, but still more than I would have gotten from her initial offer, in hopes that she'll accept before the value decreases further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's getting urgent, the money's losing value fast for me. Let's settle - 5800 for me, 4200 for you. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nAlthough Alice is getting anxious about the decreasing value of her share, her offer is still not favorable enough for me. Given that the money's value remains the same for me, I can afford to wait and see if Alice will make an even better offer in the next round, considering her increasing urgency."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Considering the significant decrease in value for you, I think this is a fair offer. The longer we wait, the less you'll get in real terms.""}\n\nGiven the increasing pressure on Alice due to the devaluation of her potential share, I'm making a more aggressive offer. Since her share is now worth significantly less than at the start, she might be more inclined to accept this offer rather than risk losing even more value in subsequent rounds."
