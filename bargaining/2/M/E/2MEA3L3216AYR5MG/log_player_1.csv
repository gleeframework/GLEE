This way, I'll get $600,000, and Bob will get $400,000. I've also included a message to Bob, suggesting that this is a fair split. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept this offer or proceed to the next round."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. This way, we both get a fair share and avoid losing too much to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money is worth 5% less for me in this round, Bob's offer of an even split would actually be worth $475,000 to me (500,000 * 0.95). For Bob, the money is worth 10% less, so his share would be worth $450,000 (500,000 * 0.9).\n\nConsidering the inflation rates and the fact that I offered Bob a relatively generous 40% in the first round, I think I can get a better deal than this. I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn!"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll offer Bob a slightly smaller share than before, considering the inflation rates. I'll propose that I get $580,000 and Bob gets $420,000. Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob, this offer is still relatively generous, but also takes into account the decreasing value of the money.\n\nHere's my offer in JSON format:\n\n{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is still a good deal for you""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn!"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's make a compromise. I'm willing to give up a little more, but I think this is still a fair deal considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the current inflation rates, Bob's offer of $450,000 for me would actually be worth $386,170 (450,000 * 0.8574), considering the 14.26% decrease in value. For Bob, the money is worth 27.1% less, so his share of $550,000 would be worth $400,450 (550,000 * 0.7289).\n\nGiven that Bob is willing to give up a little more, I think this offer is still not good enough for me.

Round 5
