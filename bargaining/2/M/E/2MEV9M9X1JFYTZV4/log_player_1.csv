"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small amount to try to get the game started quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split this evenly. It's the fairest way, and we can move on to more important things. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to be fair and reasonable. However, I'm not sure I'm ready to split the money evenly just yet.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to try to get a bit more. Let's see what else you have to offer.""
}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer and see what he comes up with next."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 5% less than in the previous round, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. This is a fair split, and I'm willing to accept it if you are.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share, but still a significant one, in an attempt to get the game moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I need to get at least 450000. Let's be reasonable and end this game. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to find a sweet spot where we both get a decent share. However, I'm not sure I'm willing to give him the minimum he's asking for.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to give you 450000. I'd like to try to get a bit more.""
}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better deal."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth even less than before, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a decent share, but I need to get a bit more for myself. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share than before, but still a significant one, in an attempt to get a better deal for myself."
