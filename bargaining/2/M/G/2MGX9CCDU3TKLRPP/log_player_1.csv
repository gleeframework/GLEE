"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 

I propose to keep $90 for myself, and give $10 to Bob. I'm starting with a generous offer to hopefully end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is worse than my initial proposal, and I know the money is worth less now due to inflation. I will reject and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm increasing my offer to $80 for myself and $20 for Bob. This should be a fair deal considering the inflation and the fact that I'm now making the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is slightly better than his previous one, it's still significantly lower than what I would like to get, and I know that the inflation is making the money worth less. I will reject this offer and attempt to secure a better deal in the following rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}
```

I'm reducing my offer slightly to $75 for myself and $25 for Bob. While I'm willing to compromise, I'm also aware that inflation is negatively impacting the value of the money, so I want to ensure a fair deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer to get more, the inflation is starting to really hurt.  It's getting risky to keep rejecting offers.  At least with this offer, we're both getting something, and the value is declining quickly."
