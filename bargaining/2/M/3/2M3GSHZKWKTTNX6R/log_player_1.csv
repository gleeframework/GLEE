Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out, Alice. I'm willing to negotiate, but this offer is fair considering the decreasing value. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Let's analyze Bob's offer:

* He's using time pressure and the decreasing value to his advantage.
* While his offer is slightly better than his last, it's still heavily skewed in his favor. 

We need to push for a better deal."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The clock is ticking, Alice. I'm holding firm, but this is a reasonable offer considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly using a stalling tactic, hoping I'll panic as the deadline approaches and accept a poor deal.  While 400,000 is a tempting amount, it's important to remember:

* **The trend:** Bob's offers have been slowly increasing.  This indicates a willingness to negotiate, even if he's hiding it well.
* **Future rounds:**  If he's willing to offer 400,000 now, he'll likely go higher as the pressure mounts on *him* to make a deal before we both lose everything.

We need to show strength and make Bob understand that we won't be pressured into a bad deal."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 700000,
""bob_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""This is my final offer, Bob.  Accept it now, or we both walk away empty-handed.  The clock is ticking for both of us.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong stance:** This offer and message convey firmness and seriousness. We're no longer negotiating incrementally.
* **Time pressure shift:** By framing the deadline as a threat to both of us, we shift some of the time pressure back onto Bob. 
* **Strategic retreat:** While lower than previous offers, 700,000 is still a significant amount. It leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a ""win"" if he accepts, making it more palatable.

This is a calculated risk.  Bob might call our bluff.  However, given his previous offers and the increasing pressure, there's a good chance he'll see this as his last opportunity for a substantial gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer, Alice.  Take it or leave it.  We both lose if this goes any further 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tense moment, but we can't afford to panic. Here's why:

* **Mirroring:** Bob is using our language (""final offer,"" emphasizing the shared loss), indicating he's feeling the pressure too.
* **Incremental Increase:** His offer only went up slightly from 400,000 to 450,000. He's still trying to lowball us, hoping we crack.
* **Time Advantage:** We still have a few rounds left.  Bob's fear of losing everything will increase significantly in the next round or two.

We need to hold strong. This rejection sends a message that we're serious about walking away.  Bob will have to make a much better offer in the next round if he wants any deal at all."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Bob, it's clear we both want this money. I'm offering a compromise.  Let's end this now before we both end up with nothing.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Appearing Reasonable:** This offer, while still favoring us, takes on a more conciliatory tone.  This could be key to sway Bob, who's likely feeling the pressure. 
* **Significant Concession:**  Dropping to 600,000 is a substantial move on our part, making it appear as if we are truly trying to reach an agreement.
* **Urgency:**  We're emphasizing the shared risk again, reminding Bob that time is running out for both of us. 

This is a critical juncture. By making this offer, we are balancing our need for a good deal with the very real risk of losing everything. Let's hope Bob sees this as his final opportunity to salvage something from this negotiation."
