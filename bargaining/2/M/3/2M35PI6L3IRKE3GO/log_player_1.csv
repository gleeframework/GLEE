"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 525000 
# Bob gain: 475000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

After calculating the effect of inflation on my gain, I realize that the offer is actually worth:

My gain: 525,000 * 0.8 = 420,000
Bob's gain: 475,000 * 0.95 = 450,750

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me. I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the inflation effect, my offer is worth 20% less than the previous round's offer. Since the previous round's offer was 525,000 for me, my new offer is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $580,000 and keeping $420,000 for myself."
