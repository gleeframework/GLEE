"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm offering you 40 dollars, and I'll take 60 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 5% less, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 45 * 0.95 = 42.75
* Bob gain: 55 * 0.95 = 52.25

I'll accept this offer.
