**Reasoning:**

It's painful, but I need to accept. Here's why:

* **Severe Inflation:** The inflation is eating rapidly into my potential gains.  Waiting any longer will result in an even worse deal.
* **Bob's Stance:** Bob has made it clear he's willing to push this to the limit. His offer is unlikely to improve.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Even if I could drag this out a few more rounds, the potential gains would be significantly reduced by inflation. It's not worth the risk. 

It's a bitter pill to swallow, but sometimes in negotiations, you have to cut your losses."
