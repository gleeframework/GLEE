"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm proposing a 90/10 split, with me taking the larger share. I'm hoping this is a fair enough offer to start, and that Bob will see the value in accepting it rather than risking a smaller share in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While 200,000 is something, it's a significant drop from the 900,000 I was originally offered. I'm not willing to accept such a drastic reduction in my share. I'll take my chances with the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering a 60/40 split this time. This is still a significant amount for both of us, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the inflation and the fact that I'm taking the lead in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While 300,000 is something, it's significantly less than the 600,000 I was hoping for in the previous round.  I'm still optimistic about getting a better deal later on, and I'm not willing to settle for such a low amount."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000}
```

I'm offering a 40/60 split in favor of Bob. This is a compromise considering the current inflation and the fact that Bob has been consistently taking a larger share in previous rounds. However, I believe it's still a fair offer that acknowledges both of our interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While this offer is still significantly lower than what I'd hoped for in the beginning, it's better than nothing at this point.  Considering the amount of inflation and the dwindling rounds, it's becoming increasingly risky to continue rejecting offers. I'll take the 450,000 and move on."
