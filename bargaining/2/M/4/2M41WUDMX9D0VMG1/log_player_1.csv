"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $20 and keeping $80 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly.  We both get a good share, and the game is over quickly. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

I'll carefully consider Bob's offer. Since the money is worth less now, I'd rather take a smaller share now and end the game quickly. I accept Bob's offer.
