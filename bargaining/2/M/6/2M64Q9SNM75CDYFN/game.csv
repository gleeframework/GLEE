400000.0,600000.0,"Let's be reasonable. I'll take a slightly larger share, but still leave you with a significant amount. We can end this early and both walk away with something.",Bob,2,

600000.0,400000.0,"I'm willing to negotiate, but your offer is too low. I propose a 60/40 split.  This is a fair compromise, and we can avoid further rounds and the risk of inflation.",Alice,3,

300000.0,700000.0,"I'm willing to give you a bit more than last time, but I still need a majority. This is our best chance to get a decent share before inflation eats away at our gains.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Let's split it down the middle.  The inflation is really starting to hurt, and I think we're both better off with a 50/50 split rather than risking getting nothing at all.",Alice,5,
