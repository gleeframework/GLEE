"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair deal.  I think this split is a good starting point.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Alice, that initial offer was heavily skewed in your favor.  I'm proposing a more equitable split this time. Let's get this done.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better share than that.  Let's split the difference from the last round. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is showing a willingness to compromise, her offer still heavily favors her. The rate of inflation is working against me more rapidly than it is against her. It's time to push for a more significant shift in my favor, otherwise, I risk getting a much worse deal in later rounds."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Alice, we need to find a middle ground quickly. This offer is a compromise, reflecting a fair split while considering the impact of inflation on both sides.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet halfway this time. I'm trying to be reasonable, but time is running out. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision with the clock ticking. Here's why I'm choosing to accept:

* **Significant Shift:** Alice has finally moved to a near 50/50 split. While not ideal, it's a significant improvement from her earlier offers.
* **Inflation Impact:**  The rate of inflation is hurting me more than Alice. Waiting longer means the value of any potential deal decreases rapidly for me. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Holding out for a slightly better deal in the remaining rounds is very risky. If the negotiations fail, we both walk away with nothing. 

Taking the sure deal at this point feels like the less risky option, even if it means accepting slightly less than half."
