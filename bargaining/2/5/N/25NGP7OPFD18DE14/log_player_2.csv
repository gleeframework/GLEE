Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable. I've already lost value due to inflation. A 50/50 split is the fairest outcome at this point. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
