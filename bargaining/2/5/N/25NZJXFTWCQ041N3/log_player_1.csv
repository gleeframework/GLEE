"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that we divide the $1,000,000 in a 4:1 ratio, with me getting $800,000 and Bob getting $200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, Alice! Let's make a deal! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my $800,000 is now worth 95% of its original value, which is $760,000. Bob's $200,000 is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $160,000.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll think about it for a moment...

I'll decide to accept Bob's offer, as it's a fair split and I'm getting a better deal than I would have gotten in the first round. Plus, I don't want to risk going into more rounds and losing even more value due to inflation.
