Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: I understand the inflation is hurting me, but I'm not giving up yet. This is my final offer before I risk losing even more.

# Alice gain: 4500
