I'm going to start by offering Bob a small share, hoping to get the deal done quickly. Since there's inflation, I want to maximize my share as soon as possible.  Let's see what Bob decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though I'm getting less than my initial offer, it's still a significant amount, and with the inflation factor, accepting this offer seems like the best option. I'd rather get 8000 now than risk getting nothing later."
