"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and let's end the game!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but it's still a decent amount. The message is a bit playful, trying to entice him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair and reasonable split, considering the current market conditions. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my share is now worth less than before.

I'm not too thrilled about Bob's offer, as it seems he's trying to take advantage of the situation. I'd like to make a counteroffer to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not fair, I'm willing to compromise, but 400000 is too low for me. I'll make a new offer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3

  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's end this game with a fair split!""
}

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the current market conditions. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my share is worth significantly less than before. I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I need to be realistic about the situation.

I'll think carefully before making a decision. Considering the decreasing value of my potential gain, I'll try to make a counteroffer to see if I can get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not good enough, I'm willing to accept a lower share, but 300000 is too low. I'll make a new offer.""
