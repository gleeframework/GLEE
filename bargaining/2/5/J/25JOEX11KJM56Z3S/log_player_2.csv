Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being reasonable, Bob. Don't be greedy. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This is still a bad deal for Bob, even considering the inflation. Alice is getting a much larger share and hoping Bob will panic as the rounds progress.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer, Bob. Let's end this now and both get something. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a close call, and a tough decision for Bob. However, with the inflation increasing, it's becoming riskier to hold out for a much better deal. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** There are only 7 rounds left. If Bob rejects this, he risks Alice getting increasingly desperate and offering even less favorable terms later.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  While this offer isn't ideal, the inflation means that even if Bob manages to secure a slightly better deal in later rounds, the actual value he gains might not be significantly higher. 
* **Guaranteed Payout:** Accepting now guarantees Bob a reasonable sum. Rejecting risks walking away with nothing if a deal can't be reached in the remaining rounds. 

While Bob could gamble on Alice panicking more than him, accepting now is a safer play that ensures a decent payout."
