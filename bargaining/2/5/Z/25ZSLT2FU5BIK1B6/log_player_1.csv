"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000 dollars, which is 40% of the original 1,000,000. This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping it will set a good tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is affecting me more than Bob, it seems!

Considering the offer, I think I'll have to reject it. I'm not willing to accept a share of 45% when I was initially offered 60% in the first round. I'll try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effecting me even more, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better deal to account for the inflation.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway and split it 50/50, considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a better deal. However, I'm not willing to accept a 50/50 split, especially since I was initially offered 60% in the first round.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really taking a toll on me now. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal.

```

  ""alice_gain"": 650000,
  ""bob_gain"": 350000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of. This is my final offer.""
