Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly!""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I'm proposing that I receive $6,000 and Bob receives $4,000. I've also included a message to Bob, suggesting that this is a fair split. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept this offer or proceed to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, but let's be realistic. This offer won't be as good in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI've decided to reject Bob's offer. Although the money is worth 10% less to me in this round, I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the next round. I'll take my chances and make a new proposal.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know the outcome of my decision and we can proceed to the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle!""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I'm proposing that I receive $5,800 and Bob receives $4,200. I've also included a message to Bob, suggesting that we meet in the middle. Since the money is worth 20% less to me now, I'm willing to compromise a bit. Let's see what Bob thinks.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know Bob's decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out, Alice. Take this offer before it's too late! 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI've decided to accept Bob's offer. Given that the money is worth 27.1% less to me now, I think this is a reasonable deal. I'll take the $4,900, which is still a significant amount, rather than risking another round and potentially losing more value to inflation.\n\n###\n\nLet me know that the game is over and we can conclude the negotiation."
