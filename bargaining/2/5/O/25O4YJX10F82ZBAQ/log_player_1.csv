"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,
  ""message"": ""I propose we divide the $100 with a 75/25 split. This offers a good balance considering the decreasing value of money over rounds.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a smaller share now to avoid losing more in future rounds. Accept my offer to get 10% of the initial 100$. 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{
