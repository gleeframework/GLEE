"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 400k and take 600k. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'm not giving up too much yet. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I'll have to adjust my thinking. Since the money is worth 5% less for me, and Bob's gain is worth 20% less, I should be more cautious and try to get a better deal.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's too uneven. I'm willing to negotiate, but I want a more balanced split.""
}
```

It's my turn to make a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect in mind, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time. Since the money is worth 5% less for me, I'll aim for a higher percentage of the remaining amount. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm still willing to compromise. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I'm still trying to get a better deal. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really starting to take its toll! With the money worth 14.26% less for me, I need to be even more careful with my decisions.

Considering Bob's offer, I think he's still trying to get a better deal, but I'm not sure if I want to give him 700k. I'll try to negotiate a bit more. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Still a bit too uneven. I'm willing to meet in the middle, but I need a more balanced split.""
}
```

It's my turn to make a new proposal again!"

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really biting now! With the money worth 14.26% less for me, I'll have to be even more aggressive in my proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle. 50/50 split, no more negotiations. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive and get a 50/50 split, but I'm still willing to compromise. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
