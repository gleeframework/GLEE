"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm taking a large share to start, but I want to see if Bob is agreeable to a more equitable split later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

This is a much better deal for Bob, but I'm not going to accept it just yet. I think I can still get a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
``` 

I'm lowering my demand a bit, but I still want to get the majority of the money. I think this is a fair offer considering the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more,  the inflation is starting to hurt. Accepting this offer is the best way to secure some money before it's worth even less."
