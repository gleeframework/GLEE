""alice_gain"": 350000,

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your point about fairness, but your last offer was still too one-sided.  Let's compromise.  I'll take 45% and you take 55%. This is a more reasonable split, and we can move forward.  We're both losing money with each round. 
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000
