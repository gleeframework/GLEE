"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is 20% of the initial $10,000. I'm keeping the remaining $8,000 for myself. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer. Your turn to decide! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking its toll.

I'll have to be more careful with my decision-making. Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that $6,000 is a good enough deal for me. I'd like to see a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation reducing the value of the money by 20% each round, I'll have to be strategic about my offer. Here's my next proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""bob_gain"": 6000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you more, Bob. But I need to be careful with the inflation.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $6,000, which is a more generous split, but I'm keeping $4,000 for myself. Let's see if Bob accepts this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not sure if it's enough. Your turn to decide! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll now.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that $3,000 is a good enough deal for me, especially considering the rapid decline in the value of money. I'd like to see a better offer from Bob, but I'm running out of time!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation reducing the value of the money by 48.8% from the first round, I'll have to be even more cautious. Here's my next proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 2000,
  ""bob_gain"": 8000,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking a risk, Bob. I think this is my last chance to get a decent share.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $8,000, which is a significant portion of the remaining money. I'm keeping $2,000 for myself, but I'm hoping Bob will see the value in this offer and accept it."
