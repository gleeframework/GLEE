"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering you 400,000$. It's a fair deal, considering I'm the one making the first proposal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one.

After considering the offer, I decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure if I want to give up that much more than I initially proposed. I'll wait for another round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Inflation is biting, and the money is worth less than before!

Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}
```

I'm offering you a slightly lower amount than before, but still trying to get a good deal!"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are really taking a toll on the money's value!

After considering Bob's offer, I decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

It looks like we're getting close to a 50/50 split, and I'm not sure if I can do better than this."
