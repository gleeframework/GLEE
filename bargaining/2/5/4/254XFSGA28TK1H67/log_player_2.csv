"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 60% and you get 40%. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm Bob, and I'm not happy with a 40/60 split right off the bat.  I'll see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's try a 55/45 split. It's a bit more even, and I think it's a good starting point for a fair division.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I'll take 55% this time.  Let's see if we can get this done before the money loses too much value. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice's offer is better than what I had in round 2.  I'd rather secure the deal now before the money gets even less valuable."
