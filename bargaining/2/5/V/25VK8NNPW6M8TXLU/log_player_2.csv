"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair, but slightly unbalanced, split.  This allows us both to get a decent chunk of the money, while also giving me a bit more since I'm taking the risk of proposing first.  Let's make this quick and get the money! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000
