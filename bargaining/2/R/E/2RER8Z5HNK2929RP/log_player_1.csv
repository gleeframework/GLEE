"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $20, which is a relatively small amount, hoping he'll accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly. We both get a good starting point. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to be more careful with my decision.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2. My gain of $50 is worth 20% less than the $80 I could have gotten in the first round, and I'm not sure if Bob's gain is worth 5% less than his original offer. I'd like to make a counteroffer to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With inflation taking its toll, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a better deal. Here's my proposal for round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""You said we should split it evenly, but I think I deserve a bit more. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40, which is a slightly better deal for me, considering the inflation. Let's see if he'll accept this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we both need to compromise a little. Let's split the money 60/40, giving you a good starting point, and me a chance to make a fair profit. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings! Considering the money is worth significantly less now, I'll have to be careful.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 4. His offer is a 60/40 split, which is actually a worse deal for me than my previous offer of 60/40. I think I can do better than that.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth even less due to inflation, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a better deal. Here's my proposal for round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm not getting any younger, Bob. I need a bigger share to make this worth my while. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $45, which is a slightly better deal for me, considering the inflation. Let's see if he'll accept this time!"
