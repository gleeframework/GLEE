Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's start with a 50/50 split.  This is the fairest way to divide the money. If we keep rejecting offers, the value of the money will decrease quickly. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
