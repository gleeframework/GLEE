"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}

I'm offering a 50-50 split, which seems fair to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation factor, the money is worth less than before. I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since Bob is offering me less than I initially proposed, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer was 60-40, I'll try to counter with a more favorable split for myself. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on the money's value! Since Bob's offer is similar to his previous one, and considering the decreased value of the money, I'll think carefully about this one.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
