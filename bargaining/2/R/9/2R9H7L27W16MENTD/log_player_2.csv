It's better to try and get a larger share of the money, especially since inflation will decrease the value of the money in the future."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.

While I'd prefer to get more, the inflation is starting to eat away at the value of the money. A 50/50 split is a fair outcome at this point, and accepting avoids the risk of getting less in the future."
