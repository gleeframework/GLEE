"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and start fresh!""
}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not bad, but I think I can do better!

```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and will make a new proposal in Round 3."
