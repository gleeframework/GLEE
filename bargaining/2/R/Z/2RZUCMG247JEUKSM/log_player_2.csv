"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand inflation gives you an advantage, but let's be reasonable. I'm offering 81% to you, and 19% to me. This still keeps a substantial amount for you while giving me a fair share considering the diminishing value. 
# Bob gain: 190000 
# Alice gain: 810000
