"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money 60/40.  It's a good deal for both of us in the first round. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not satisfied with 40 dollars. I think I can get a better deal in the next rounds. Besides, 60/40 doesn't seem like a fair split to me. I'll take my chances and make a counteroffer in the next round. Bring it on!\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know when it's my turn to make an offer. I'm ready!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer. Since the money is now worth 5% less, I'll take that into account. Here's my proposal:\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's split the money 55/45. It's a more fair deal considering the inflation.""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn, Alice!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you want a larger share, but your previous offer wasn't fair considering the early rounds.  Let's meet in the middle - this offer still gives you a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI still don't think 42 dollars is enough for me. Meeting in the middle doesn't necessarily mean it's a fair deal. Considering the inflation, I think I can still get a better offer in the next rounds. I'll keep pushing for a more favorable split. Let's see what happens next!\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know when it's my turn to make another offer. I'm ready to negotiate further!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make another offer. Considering the inflation is now at 9.75%, I'll adjust my proposal accordingly. Here's my new offer:\n\n{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Let's consider the inflation and split the money 52/48. It's a more reasonable deal given the current situation.""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn, Alice!"
