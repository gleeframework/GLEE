"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing to split the $10,000 equally between us, with each of us getting $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slight advantage for me, but still a fair deal 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the absolute values, not the relative values. In this case, I'll get $4,000, which is less than my initial proposal of $5,000.

I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""A slight adjustment to get closer to a fair deal""}

I'm proposing to give Bob a slightly smaller share this time, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but not too much 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Another round!

Considering the inflation effect on Bob's offer, I'll take into account the reduced value of the money he's offering. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll focus on the absolute values.

In this case, I'll get $4,500, which is still less than my initial proposal of $5,000. However, it's a slightly better offer than the previous one.

I'll accept Bob's offer this time.
