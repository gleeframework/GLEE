"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me $6,000 and leaving $4,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this one...

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, I'll need to consider that when making my decision. If I accept this offer, I'll get $4000, which is worth 95% of the original $4000 I would have gotten in the first round.

On the other hand, Bob's offer is a 60-40 split, which is a better deal for me than the 40-60 split he initially proposed.

So, I'll decide to... {""decision"": ""accept""}"
