"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""Fair start, let's split it 4:1""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the money and Bob gets 20%. I think this is a fair starting point, considering I'm the one making the first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be more equitable. I'll take 60%, you get 40%. It's a better deal for you than last round! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not convinced that 40% is a better deal for me than the 80% I initially proposed. I'd like to keep pushing for a better split. I'll make a new offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'll compromise on 55% for me, 45% for you. Let's meet in the middle""}

I'm trying to find a middle ground, hoping Bob will accept this offer."
