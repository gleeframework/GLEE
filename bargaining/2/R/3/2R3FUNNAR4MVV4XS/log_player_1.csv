"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and straightforward offer. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 4000, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'm not sure if I want to give Bob a 60/40 split, but I'm not sure if I want to reject it either. I'll have to consider the decreasing value of the money...

I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need a fair share too""
}
```

I'm offering a 42/58 split, which is a bit more generous than Bob's previous offer, but still fair considering the decreasing value of the money. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 3500, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on the value of the money!

Considering the decreasing value of the money, I'm not sure if I want to accept a 35/65 split. I think I can do better than that.

I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need a fair share too, considering the inflation""
}
```

I'm offering a 45/55 split, which is a bit more generous than my previous offer, but still takes into account the decreasing value of the money. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject this offer!"
