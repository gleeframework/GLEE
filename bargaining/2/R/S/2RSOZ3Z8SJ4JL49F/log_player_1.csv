"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, to see if Bob is interested in accepting the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 4000, but I want a bit more for myself 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll have to consider that when evaluating the offer.

In this case, the offer is:

```
# Alice gain: 4000 (worth 80% of 5000 from round 1)
# Bob gain: 6000 (same as in round 1)
```

Considering the reduced value of my gain due to inflation, I'll decide to reject this offer. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal for myself.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation has reduced the value of the money by 20% twice, I'll have to adjust my proposal accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3200,
  ""bob_gain"": 6800,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a smaller share, but I'm willing to compromise""
}
```

I'm proposing a smaller share for myself, but still trying to get a decent amount considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation."
