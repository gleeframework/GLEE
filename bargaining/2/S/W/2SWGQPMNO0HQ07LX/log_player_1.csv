"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $10,000, leaving Bob with 40%. I'm framing it as a fair start to the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, let's meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less in the second round, my gain of 3000 is now worth 9000 in the first round's money.

I'm not too thrilled about the 60-40 split, but I'll consider Bob's offer. However, I still think I can do better.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the inflation and the fact that Bob was willing to meet in the middle last round.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""Meet in the middle, but I'm willing to give a bit more to you""
}
```

I'm offering a 45-55 split, which is closer to the 40-60 split that Bob suggested last round, but with a slight bias towards me."
