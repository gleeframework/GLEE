"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $10,000 and Bob gets 20%. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, a fair compromise! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 4:6 split, but I do want to get some money. Since the money is worth less to me due to inflation, I'll accept Bob's offer.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
