"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm offering you 90 dollars and Bob gets 10. I figure it's a fair start, considering the inflation in later rounds will affect me more. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It's not ideal, but the inflation will hurt me much more in the next round. Accepting this offer is the best way to ensure I get something."
