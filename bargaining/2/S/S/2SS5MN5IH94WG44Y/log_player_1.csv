"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 10% and keep the rest.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. The message is a friendly gesture to start the negotiation. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 50-50 split to ensure fairness. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to be fair, but I'm not ready to give up that much yet.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject Bob's 50-50 offer and hope to get a better deal in the next round. The money is worth 10% less now, so I'm thinking of a new proposal that takes this into account. Your turn, Bob!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 10% less than in Round 2, so it's now worth 90% of what it was in Round 1.

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. Take 30% and I'll keep 70%.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself. The message is a compromise, hoping Bob will accept a smaller share. Your turn, Bob!"
