Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this inflation is eating at our potential gains. Let's be sensible - 58/42. I need to get a decent return and this split accounts for the declining value. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58
