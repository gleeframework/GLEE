Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor. I figure this is a good starting point, as it's a significant advantage for me but still leaves Bob with a decent amount.  Let's see how he reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is worse than my initial proposal, even accounting for the inflation. I'm going to reject it and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to counter with a 70/30 split in my favor. Since Bob rejected my initial proposal, I'm trying to find a compromise that's still favorable to me but might be more appealing to him."
