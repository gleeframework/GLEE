"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair division, with me taking 90% and you taking 10%. Let's get this done quickly! 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not accepting this offer as I think I can get a better deal in the next rounds. Alice's message implies she's eager to finish quickly, which might give me leverage in future rounds. Plus, with the inflation rates, she loses more value each round than I do, so I'm not in a rush. Let's proceed and see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 40, ""alice_gain"": 60, ""message"": ""Let's meet somewhere in the middle, considering we both want a fair share and the inflation is looming over us.""}\n\n###\n\nSince Alice loses more value each round due to inflation, I'm hoping she'll consider a more balanced split to avoid further devaluation of her potential gain. By proposing a 40-60 split, I'm aiming to appear reasonable while also trying to maximize my share. Let's see how Alice responds!"
