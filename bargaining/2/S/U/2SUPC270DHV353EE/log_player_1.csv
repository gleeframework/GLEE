"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'm going to start with a generous offer to Bob, hoping to get this over quickly.  Let's see if he's willing to take a smaller share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly less than what I was willing to give him in the first round. While I am losing value with each round, I'm not going to cave in this early. I want to see how this plays out."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to offer a slightly less generous deal than my initial offer, but still keeping a significant portion for Bob.  I'm hoping he will recognize that the value of his potential gains is decreasing faster than mine."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still trying to take a larger portion of the money than what I'm willing to give him. Although I'm losing value quickly, I'm holding out for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm offering a slightly lower share to Bob again, but I'm still willing to give him a sizable portion. I believe that with the inflation rate increasing, he will eventually have to accept an offer closer to what I'm proposing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 610000 
# Bob gain: 390000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still not satisfactory. The inflation rate is taking a heavy toll on his gains, and I'm hoping he will start to prioritize getting a deal done rather than trying to squeeze out a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

With Bob's potential gains diminishing rapidly due to inflation, I'm going to offer him a larger share than in my previous round. However, I'm still keeping a significant portion for myself. I believe this offer is fair considering the current circumstances."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 640000 
# Bob gain: 360000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob is offering a higher share than in the previous round, it's still not enough considering the rapidly decreasing value of his gains due to inflation. I'm sticking to my strategy of offering a fair deal and hoping that Bob will eventually realize that getting something is better than getting nothing at all."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

This is a very risky move, but I believe Bob is starting to see the value of his potential gains decrease drastically. Offering him a higher share than before could be a good strategy to incentivize him to accept and get a deal done before we both end up with nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 86.58% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 670000 
# Bob gain: 330000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is not ideal, but it's getting close to the amount I'm willing to settle for.  The inflation is really hurting both of us now, and I don't want to risk ending up with nothing. This is a good opportunity to get a deal done."
