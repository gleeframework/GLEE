"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

This offer gives me a large share of the money (9000$) while still leaving Bob with a small portion.  This is a risky strategy, as I'm hoping Bob will accept to avoid the risk of inflation, but I'm willing to gamble."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. While I would have accepted it in the first round, the inflation has made it less appealing. I believe I can still get a better deal for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000} 
```

I'm reducing my share slightly to 8000$ while increasing Bob's to 2000$.  This is a compromise, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it due to the inflation and the fact that he rejected my previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is even worse than the last round.  The inflation has significantly reduced the value of his share, making it even less appealing.  I'll continue to push for a larger portion in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000} 
```

I'm reducing my share again to 7000$, but this time I'm giving Bob a slightly larger portion of 3000$.  The inflation is starting to have a real effect, and I'm worried about getting a worse deal if I keep rejecting offers.  However, I still believe I can get a better deal for myself."
