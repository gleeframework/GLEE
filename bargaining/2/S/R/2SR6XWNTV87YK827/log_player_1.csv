"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 70-30, I'll take the risk of inflation!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor, with me getting 70 dollars and Bob getting 30 dollars. The message is a playful way of acknowledging that I'm taking on the risk of inflation, which will affect my share more significantly in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, let's see if we can agree on this 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 10% less, so the value of my potential gain is 70 * 0.9 = 63 dollars.

Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, which is a reasonable compromise. I'll decide to accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
