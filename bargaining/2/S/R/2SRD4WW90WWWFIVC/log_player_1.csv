Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your starting offer was quite cheeky!  Inflation is eating away at your potential gains far quicker than mine. I'm feeling generous, so I'll offer you $350,000.  Let's close this deal and call it a day. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
