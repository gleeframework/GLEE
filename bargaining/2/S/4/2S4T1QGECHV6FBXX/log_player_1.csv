"Round 1

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. 50/50 is the best way to start. We both have a chance to get more in the later rounds. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Okay, Bob, let's meet halfway. I'm lowering my initial offer to give us both a good deal.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a little more, but I need to get at least 55 to make it worthwhile for me. Let's make this happen. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is compromising a bit, this deal is still highly unfavorable in the long run. Bob's perception of value decreases with each round, making him more likely to accept a less favorable deal later.  We can still negotiate for a better outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 52,
""bob_gain"": 48,
""message"": ""This is a fair offer, Bob. It gives me a slight edge, but you're still getting a good deal considering the time pressure and inflation.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm raising my offer again. This is a good deal for both of us, considering the time pressure and inflation. Let's end this game now. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is getting desperate, which is good for us. He's offering more than he needs to at this stage. His perception of value is significantly lower due to inflation. We can push for a better deal, but we need to be mindful of the dwindling time."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 50,
""bob_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Bob, let's end this. 50/50. It's fair and we both walk away with something."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:** Time is becoming a critical factor now. While we might squeeze out a bit more, there's a real risk of Bob becoming even more desperate and offering significantly less in the next rounds. A 50/50 split guarantees a reasonable outcome given the time pressure."
