Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a fair share, let's start with this!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000 and keeping $9,000 for myself."

Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

I don't think splitting it 50/50 is the best deal for me, considering the value of the money is decreasing. I'd rather try to get a better offer.

I'll think carefully about this offer... Considering the decreasing value of the money, I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal. I'll try to negotiate further.

# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really eating away at the value of the money! I'm getting desperate, but I still need to think strategically.

Considering the decreasing value of the money, I'm not sure if $2,000 is a good enough share for me. I'll have to weigh the risks and benefits of accepting this offer.

# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is almost negligible at this point! I'm not sure if $1,000 is worth it, considering the inflation and the fact that Bob is getting the majority of the remaining money.
