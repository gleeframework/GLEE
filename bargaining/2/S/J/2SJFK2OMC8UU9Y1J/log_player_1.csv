"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $200,000 is now worth $180,000. I'm not sure I like this offer, but I'll accept it to get some money rather than risking a worse deal in future rounds.
