"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $400,000, and I'll take $600,000. You can't do better than this, can you?""
}
```

I'm starting with a relatively generous offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm sure we can find a better split that works for both of us. I'm willing to compromise, but I think we can get a little closer to 50/50. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to get closer to a 50/50 split, but his offer is still not ideal for me. Since the money is worth 20% less now, I'd like to get a bit more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm comfortable with a 60/40 split, especially with the money losing value so quickly. I'll make a new offer.""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and will make a new proposal in Round 3."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 20% less than in Round 2, so I need to adjust my offer accordingly.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to give up too much. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly larger share to Bob, but still keeping a bit more for myself. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer."
