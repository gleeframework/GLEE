"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I think a 60/40 split is a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While a 60/40 split might seem fair at the outset, it's important to consider the inflation rates.  Since my money only loses 10% per round while Alice's loses 20%, I can afford to be more patient and potentially negotiate a better deal.  By rejecting this offer, I get to make the next proposal and potentially secure a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""Let's be realistic. I'm taking the majority, but I'm willing to give you a decent share. Accept this, and we both get something.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better share than that.  Let's meet in the middle this time. 
# Bob gain: 6000 
# Alice gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly better for me than my last proposal, even with the inflation rates considered.  My share is only slightly less than my previous offer, while Alice's share is considerably reduced. This suggests she's becoming more desperate to reach a deal.  It's also important to remember that the longer we wait, the less value the money will have.  Accepting this offer guarantees me a good amount, minimizing my potential losses due to inflation."
