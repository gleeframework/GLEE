Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle of our previous offers 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is inching closer to a more even split, but it's still in her favor. By rejecting this offer, I signal that I'm willing to play the game a bit longer and aim for a better deal in the next round. The 19% inflation isn't ideal, but it's a risk I'm willing to take for a potentially better outcome."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 525000, ""alice_gain"": 475000, ""message"": ""Time is running out, let's settle this fairly. This is a strong offer considering the inflation.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting closer, let's not let inflation win 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  While not ideal, accepting this offer prevents further losses due to inflation.  It's becoming clear that Alice is unlikely to agree to a split that's significantly more in my favor. Taking this offer ensures I at least walk away with a substantial sum, rather than risking getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
