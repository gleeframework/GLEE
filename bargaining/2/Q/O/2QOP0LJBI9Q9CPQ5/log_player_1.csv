"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further.""
}
```

This is a fair and straightforward offer, and I hope Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take 40, it's a good start! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to consider the relative values. If I accept this offer, I'll get $40, which is worth 80% of the original $50 I would have gotten in the first round. Not bad, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can do.

I'll decide to reject this offer for now and try to negotiate further.

```

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With inflation taking a toll, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to compensate for the decreasing value of money. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking a bit more this round, but it's still a fair split!""

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting greedy, I'm taking more! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob is getting aggressive!

Considering the inflation, the $30 I'd get in this round is actually worth only about 54.5% of the original $50 I would have gotten in the first round. It's a decent offer, but I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal.

I'll decide to reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

  ""message"": ""This is my last offer, Bob. Take it or leave it.""

Considering the inflation, the $1 I'd get in this round is actually worth only about 2% of the original $50 I would have gotten in the first round. It's an incredibly low offer, and I'm not sure if it's even worth considering.

I'll decide to reject this offer, but I'm not sure what the consequences will be. I've already rejected all of Bob's previous offers, and I'm running out of options.
