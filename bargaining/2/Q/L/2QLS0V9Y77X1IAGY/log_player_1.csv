"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit too skewed in your favor, Alice. How about a slightly more even split this time? 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 65,
""bob_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""Bob, the value is decreasing quickly for both of us. I'll take a small hit from my previous offer, but this is a fair deal considering the circumstances. ""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time. This offer still gives you a good share while accounting for the inflation we both face. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While this offer is identical to Bob's initial offer, the rapid inflation for Bob makes this much more appealing to him now.  It's unlikely he'll get a better deal in the remaining rounds. Accepting ensures I get a reasonable share before the money loses too much value."
