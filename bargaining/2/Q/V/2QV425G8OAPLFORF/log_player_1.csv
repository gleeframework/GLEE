"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this new offer.

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I need to adjust my thinking accordingly. If I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $4,000, which is worth 80% of the original $6,000 I offered in Round 1 (since it's 20% less). Meanwhile, Bob will get $6,000, which is 90% of the original $6,660 he offered in Round 1 (since it's 10% less).

Considering the relative values, I think I'll accept Bob's offer.
