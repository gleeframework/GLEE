"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the initial $10,000, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation factored in, Bob's offer is actually a 40% gain for me (5000/12500, since 10,000 is now worth 12,500 due to inflation) and 40% gain for Bob (5000/12500).

I accept Bob's offer.
