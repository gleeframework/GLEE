Let's start with a fair split.  We'll see how Bob feels about it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'll reject this offer.  While I lose some money due to inflation, I still believe a more even split is possible. Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}
```

I'll offer a slightly more even split, with me taking slightly less than Bob.  Hopefully, this will be enough to get us to an agreement!"
