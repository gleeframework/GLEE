"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the original $100, leaving Bob with 40%. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of 30 is now worth 24 (30 x 0.8) and Bob's gain of 70 is now worth 67 (70 x 0.95).

I'm not thrilled about the large disparity in the offer, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to make a counteroffer."
