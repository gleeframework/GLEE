"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think 60% is too much for you. How about 55% for me and 45% for you?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it down the middle.  We both lose money with each round, so a fair split now is best. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nSince Alice's gain is worth 36% less, her 50 is actually less valuable than it seems. I'll try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think 60% for me and 40% for you is a fair deal now.""}"
