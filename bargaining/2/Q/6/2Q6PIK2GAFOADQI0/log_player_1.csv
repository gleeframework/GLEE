"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

This way, we both get $5,000 each, and we can call it a day. Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation factor, I'm not as keen on accepting Bob's offer. I'd rather wait for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a new proposal, taking into account the fact that the money is worth 20% less than in the first round for Bob. Since I want to make a more attractive offer, I'll give up some of my share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500
}
```"
