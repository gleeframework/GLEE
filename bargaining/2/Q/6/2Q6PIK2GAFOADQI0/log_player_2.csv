It's always worth seeing if I can get a better deal!  Let's see what Alice offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to try to get a bit more for myself this round.  It's a risk, but I think I can get a better deal than 50/50."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd love to get more, the inflation is starting to hurt.  This offer is better than my last proposal, and I don't want to risk Alice making a worse offer in the next round."
