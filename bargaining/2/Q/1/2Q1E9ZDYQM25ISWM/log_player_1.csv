"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can split the money fairly!""
}
```

This offer gives me $900,000 and Bob $100,000. The message is a gentle nudge to get Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a fair share, but not as generous as you thought 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gained in the first round still worth the same, I can afford to be a bit more cautious. However, Bob's offer is a bit more generous than my initial offer, and it's still a significant amount.

I'll decide to accept Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
