"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a division of $60 for myself and $40 for Bob, with a message that suggests fairness. Since the value of money decreases with each round, I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and not pushing Bob to reject the offer and proceed to the next round, where the money would be worth even less for both of us. Given the higher rate of inflation for Bob, he has a greater incentive to accept the offer sooner rather than later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn to propose a fairer split. This considers the declining value. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI've decided to reject Bob's offer. Although the value of money is decreasing, accepting $45, which is worth 5% less than in the first round, seems too low considering my initial proposal and the fact that I'm trying to maximize my gain. By rejecting, I'll get the chance to propose again in the next round, aiming to find a more favorable division despite the continued decrease in value."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, let's meet in the middle""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I've decided to offer a division of $57 for myself and $43 for Bob, with a message suggesting we meet in the middle, considering the impact of inflation on the value of the money. Given that the money's value decreases more significantly for Bob, I'm trying to find a balance that would make my offer more acceptable to him, while also maximizing my gain. The goal is to propose a division that Bob would find preferable to proceeding to another round where the value would decrease even further, especially for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the fairest considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant decrease in value for both of us, especially for Bob, a 50/50 split at this stage seems like the most reasonable offer. Given that the money I gain is now worth 14.26% less than in the first round, and for Bob, it's worth 48.8% less, continuing to another round risks further devaluation. Accepting this offer ensures that I secure a share of the money before its value drops even more. It's a compromise that acknowledges the impact of inflation on our negotiations."
