"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share, but you get a good chunk to begin with.  Accept, and we both win.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""That's a bit lopsided, don't you think? I'm feeling generous, so how about a more even split this time?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I'll compromise, but you need to meet me halfway. Let's split it 60/40 this time.  We both get more, and we can finally be done with this! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While this is a better offer, accepting now would still give Alice a significantly larger share. It's worth seeing if I can negotiate a more favorable outcome, even with the impact of inflation."
