"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and straightforward offer. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or reject my offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you less, but you'll still get less in the next round 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's trying to negotiate, and he's offering me $400,000, while keeping $600,000 for himself. He's right that the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the previous round due to inflation, so I'll have to consider that.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can do better than 40% of the total amount. I'd like to propose a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer in Round 2 was $400,000 for me, and the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll aim to propose a slightly higher amount for myself to account for the decrease in value.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""You're giving me less each round, so I'll ask for a bit more this time""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42% share for myself, which is a slight increase from the 40% in Bob's previous offer. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or reject my offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm trying to be more generous, but I'm not giving up too much 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to be more generous, but still keeping a slight edge for himself.

Considering the inflation has taken a bigger hit this time, with Bob's gain being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'll have to weigh my options carefully.

Since my gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider this offer. However, I'm not sure if I'm getting the best deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer, as it's a slight improvement from Bob's previous offers, and I'm not sure if I can do better in the next round."
