Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start by offering Bob a small portion of the money. This is a risky move, as he might reject it and I could end up with less in the future. However, it establishes that I am in control and sets a precedent for the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I prefer to have more, accepting this offer guarantees me a decent sum of money.  The inflation factor is significant, and continuing to reject offers could lead to both of us getting nothing. It's better to take what I can get at this point."
