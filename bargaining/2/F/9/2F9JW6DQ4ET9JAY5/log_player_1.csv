"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, it's a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. I think this is a good starting point, and it gives us both a decent chunk of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a bit less to start things off, but I think 55-45 is a fairer split considering the value decreases each round. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 55-45 split, but I can see Bob is trying to be reasonable considering the decreasing value of the money.

I'll accept this offer for now. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll take the $4,500 and hope to do better in the next round."
