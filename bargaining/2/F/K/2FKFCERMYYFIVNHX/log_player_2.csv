"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. Let's start with a fair deal. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible offer! While Alice is being somewhat generous,  I'm sure I can negotiate a much better deal in the following rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be reasonable. This split reflects our positions in the game.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it down the middle, Bob. It's the fairest way to go. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This seems fair considering the inflation working against Alice. Accepting now before our positions potentially worsen."
