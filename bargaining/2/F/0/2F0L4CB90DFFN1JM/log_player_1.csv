"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\nI'm offering Bob 45% of the total amount, which is a relatively fair starting point. Since Bob's money is worth 20% less with each passing round, he has an incentive to accept the offer sooner rather than later. I'm hoping he'll see this as a reasonable compromise and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. A 50/50 split ensures we both benefit. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nBob's offer of a 50/50 split may seem fair at first glance, but considering the inflation factor that affects Bob's gains, it's actually not as balanced as it appears. Since Bob's money is worth 20% less with each passing round, his half of the split is actually worth less than mine. I believe I can negotiate a better deal, so I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll make a slightly more aggressive offer, taking into account the fact that Bob's money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, and 40% less than in the first round. I'm hoping he'll see that it's in his best interest to accept the offer now rather than risk losing even more value in the next round.\n{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a fair deal""}\n###"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling the inflation pinch. This is my last offer to avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer in this round is actually the same as my initial offer in Round 1, which he rejected. Given that his money is now worth 48.8% less than in the first round, this offer is significantly more advantageous to me than it was initially. Since Bob claims this is his last offer and considering the substantial impact of inflation on his gains, I believe this is the best deal I can get. I'll accept this offer to secure my gains and end the game.\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n###"
