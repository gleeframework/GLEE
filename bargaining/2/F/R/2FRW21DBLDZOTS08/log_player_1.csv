"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly, Bob. Accept this and we can both go home happy!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept it and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not getting all the money, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is being a bit greedy!

I'll reject this offer. I'd rather wait for a better deal. My current proposal would have given me $8,000, and Bob's proposal now offers me only $5,000, which is worth even less due to inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal. Since the money is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll offer a smaller amount to Bob, but still try to get a decent share for myself.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""You're being too greedy, Bob! This is a fair offer, take it or leave it!""
}

Round 4

# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is still being quite stubborn!

I'll reject this offer as well. My original proposal in Round 1 would have given me $8,000, which is now worth less due to inflation, but this offer is even lower, at $4,500. I'd rather wait for a better deal.

  ""alice_gain"": 6500,

# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of my desperation!

I'll reject this offer, but not because I think I can do better. At this point, I'm willing to accept any offer that gives me some money, but $1,000 is still a very low amount, considering the original $10,000. I'll take a chance that Bob will make a better offer, but if not, I'll have to accept this one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

Note: I'm not sure if I should have accepted this offer, considering the time constraint and the fact that we're in the last round."
