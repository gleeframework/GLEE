"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can adjust in future rounds.""}

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the initial $100, which is $70, and Bob gets the remaining 30%, which is $30."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, let's see if we can improve from here 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the reduced gains due to inflation, but I'm willing to negotiate.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now. Since we're meeting in the middle, I'll take 50% of the remaining $100, which is $50, and Bob will take the other 50%, which is also $50.
