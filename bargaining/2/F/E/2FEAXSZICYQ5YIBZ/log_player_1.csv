"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you 40% of the money. Accept and we can finish the game.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's more fair to split the money evenly.  Accept this offer and we can move on. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'd like to adjust the split to account for that.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I don't think an even split is fair, considering the inflation. My offer was already generous, and now it's even less valuable. I'll make a new offer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money. Since the money is worth 10% less now, I'll aim to keep a larger share to compensate for the loss.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'll give you a slightly smaller share this round. But I think this is a fair compromise.""
}
```"
