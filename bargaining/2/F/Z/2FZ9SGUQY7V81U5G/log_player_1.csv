"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'm willing to give you a decent share.""
}
```

This offer is a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous in round 1, now it's my turn to be fair 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less in the second round, my gain of $4000 is actually worth 95% of its original value, which is $3800.

I'm not happy with this offer, as I think I'm being taken advantage of by Bob. I'd like to make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's not very generous of you, Bob. I'll make a counteroffer: 5500 for me, 4500 for you.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In the third round, the money is worth 5% less than in the second round, which means my gain of $3800 is now worth 95% of its original value, which is $3610.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to be more realistic about the value of the money now. I think this is a fairer split.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I still think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","In the fourth round, the money is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, which means my gain of $6000 is now worth 85.74% of its original value, which is $5138.4. Since Bob's offer is in terms of the original $10,000, I'll calculate his gain accordingly.

Bob's gain of $5500 is worth 95% of its original value, which is $5225.

Considering the current value of the money, I'm not happy with this offer. I'd like to make another counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I don't think I'm getting a fair deal. I'll offer 4800 for me, 5200 for you.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In the fifth round, the money is worth 19.55% less than in the first round, which means my gain of $5138.4 is now worth 80.45% of its original value, which is $4126.55.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4600,
  ""bob_gain"": 5400,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to be more realistic about the value of the money now. I think this is a fairer split, considering the inflation.""
}
