Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to try and get as much of the money as possible in the first round, while still offering Bob a tiny amount to avoid him rejecting the offer and risking a worse outcome for me in the next round.  Let's see what happens!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more, I'm not sure I'll get a better deal in the next round. I'm already losing 5% of my potential gain due to inflation, and Bob will be making the offer next time. It's a good idea to accept this offer and split the money evenly."
