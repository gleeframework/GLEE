"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair split where I get the majority, but you still get a substantial amount.  Let's end this quickly! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm not going to accept a deal where I get only 100,000, especially since Alice is getting 900,000. It's time to see what she's willing to offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. It's a fair deal considering the inflation we're facing. Let's end this now and both get a decent amount.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger share to make up for the inflation. Let's settle this quickly and avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
I'll accept this offer. Even though Alice is still getting more, I'll end up with a bigger share than her offer in Round 2, and I'm getting a decent amount.  It's not worth risking more losses due to inflation."
