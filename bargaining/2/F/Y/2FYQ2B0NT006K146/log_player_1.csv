"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so I'll have to reassess the offer.

Since the inflation affects only my gain, I'll compare the relative values of the offer. Bob's offer is the same as mine in the first round, but now my gain is worth less.

I'll reject this offer. I want to negotiate further.

I'm offering Bob $4,500 and keeping $5,500 for myself."
