I'm proposing a 9000/1000 split in my favor.  I'm feeling generous, but I'm also hoping to secure the majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I'm proposing a more equitable split this time. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that's fair to both of us, and avoid another round of rejection."
