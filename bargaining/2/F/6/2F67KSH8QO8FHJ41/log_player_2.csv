I'm going to reject this offer.  While it's a large sum, I think I can negotiate a better deal for myself.  Let's see what Alice offers next round!"

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise further, but I'm still aiming for a larger share.  60/40 seems like a good middle ground.  What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While 400,000 is a decent sum, I'm still holding out for a better deal. I believe I can get a larger share, especially as we progress further into the game and the value of the money decreases."
