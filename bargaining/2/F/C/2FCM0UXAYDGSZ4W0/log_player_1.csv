"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a small amount to get us started.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $100, and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fairer, let's try this. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to consider the decreased value of money due to inflation.

Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, my gain of 45 in this round is equivalent to 50 in the first round. I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
