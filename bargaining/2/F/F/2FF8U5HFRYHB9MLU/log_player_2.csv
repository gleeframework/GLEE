Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the need for a quicker resolution. I'm adjusting my offer again, but I need you to recognize that inflation hurts me more than you. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is acknowledging the inflation impact, she's still aiming for a larger share. Given the rapidly decreasing value of the money, especially for Alice, waiting much longer will lead to a significantly smaller pot for both of us.  I'll push for a more even split, hoping she recognizes the urgency."
