Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not going to take less than 65. Time is money for me too, and your offer is not fair. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Okay, let's be reasonable. I'll come down to 55 for me.  This is my final offer - take it or leave it.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to split it 70/30 in my favor.  This is my final offer. It's a fair compromise given how inflation is affecting you. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, accepting is the best option for Bob. Here's why:

* **Severe Inflation:** Bob is facing a 34.39% loss in value. Waiting any longer will only worsen this.
* **Declining Returns:** Bob's previous offers were already reaching the limit of what Alice considers acceptable.
* **Finality:**  Alice has presented this as her final offer.  Rejecting it likely means getting even less in subsequent rounds, with the value of the money further diminished.

While not ideal, accepting the 30/70 split minimizes losses at this late stage in the game."
