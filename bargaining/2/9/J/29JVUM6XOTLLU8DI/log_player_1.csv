"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started, I'll give you a fair share!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'm starting low! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is quite aggressive, but I'll consider it.

Since the money is worth 20% less, my gain would be $100,000 * 0.8 = $80,000, and Bob's gain would be $900,000 * 0.8 = $720,000.

Since the money is worth 48.8% less, my gain would be $300,000 * 0.5162 = $154,860, and Bob's gain would be $700,000 * 0.5162 = $360,740.
