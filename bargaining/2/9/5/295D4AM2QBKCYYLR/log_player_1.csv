"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10} 
``` 

I propose that I take $90 and Bob takes $10. This is a fairly generous offer to start, and it will ensure that the game ends quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best strategic move. The inflation means that if I reject, Bob will have a larger share in the next round, and my share could shrink further. This ensures I get a fair amount, even with the inflation."
