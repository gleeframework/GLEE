Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, we can still make a good deal before the money loses value. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
