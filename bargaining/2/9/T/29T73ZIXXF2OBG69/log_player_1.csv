"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is 10% of the initial amount, and keeping the remaining $900,000 for myself. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer to end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous this round.  Take this and we can call it a day. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is quite generous, but I'm not going to fall for it. With the inflation effect, my gain of $100,000 is only worth 80% of what it was in the previous round. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation kicking in, my gain is worth even less now. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to make up for it.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Time's running out, Bob. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, which is 30% of the initial amount, and keeping the remaining $700,000 for myself. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to get worried about inflation, but I'm still willing to negotiate.  Let's split the money more evenly this time. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is a bit more even, but I'm not convinced it's the best deal for me. Considering the inflation effect, my gain of $300,000 is worth only 48.8% of what it was in the first round. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.
