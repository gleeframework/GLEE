"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nIn this offer, I, Alice, am proposing to take 55% of the money, which is $550,000, and offering Bob 45%, which is $450,000. The message ""Let's be fair"" is an attempt to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept the offer.\n\nNow it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept this offer or proceed to the next round. Please let me know Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, it's my turn to propose now. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, although the message appeals to fairness, the offer itself is less favorable to me than my initial proposal. Considering the inflation, accepting this offer would mean I get 5% less value than if I had accepted a similar offer in the first round. I'll proceed to the next round to try and negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 520000, ""bob_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\nIn this offer, I'm proposing to take 52% of the money, which is $520,000, and offering Bob 48%, which is $480,000. The message ""Meet me in the middle"" is an attempt to find a compromise between our previous offers and appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and willingness to find a mutually acceptable solution.\n\nConsidering the inflation, both of us lose value with each passing round, but Bob loses more. This offer is slightly more favorable to Bob than my initial offer, considering the loss of value due to inflation. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a good opportunity to end the game before the money loses even more value."
