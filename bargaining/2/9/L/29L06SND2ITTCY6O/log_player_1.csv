"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start, hoping Bob will accept and we can avoid further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer. Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 4000 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, which is 4000 * 0.8 = 3200. Bob's gain of 6000 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, which is 6000 * 0.95 = 5700.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'd like to try to get a better deal, considering the inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my goal is to get a larger share of the remaining amount. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can move forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but don't expect it to last! 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the values:

My gain of 4800 is worth 48.8% of the original amount, which is 4800 * 0.488 = 2344.8. Bob's gain of 5200 is worth 86.74% of the original amount, which is 5200 * 0.8674 = 4509.28.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer, as it's a slightly better deal than my previous offer, and I don't want to risk going into further rounds with decreasing values due to inflation."
