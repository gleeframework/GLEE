"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split it 90/10 in my favor.  I'm sure we can both be happy with that. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to make a counteroffer. Here's my proposal:\n\n# Bob's message: How about we split it 50/50? That way we both get an equal share.\n# Bob gain: 500000\n# Alice gain: 500000\n\nPlease let me know if Alice accepts or rejects my offer.\n\n###\n\n(Note: Please remember to apply the inflation rates to the money values in the next round, 20% less for me and 10% less for Alice.)\n\n###\n\nAlso, just to clarify, the inflation rates should be applied to the original amount of 1,000,000, not the proposed gains. So, in the next round, the total amount would be worth 800,000 for me (1,000,000 x 0.8) and 900,000 for Alice (1,000,000 x 0.9)."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make my offer. Here's my proposal:\n\n{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 40/60. It's a fair compromise considering the inflation.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know if Alice accepts or rejects my offer.\n\n###\n\n(Remember to apply the inflation rates to the money values in the next round, 20% less for me and 10% less for Alice, if Alice rejects my offer.)\n\n###\n\nAlso, just to clarify, the inflation rates should be applied to the original amount of 1,000,000, not the proposed gains. So, in the next round, the total amount would be worth 640,000 for me (1,000,000 x 0.8 x 0.8) and 810,000 for Alice (1,000,000 x 0.9 x 0.9)."
