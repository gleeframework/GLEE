Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bigger share. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I reject this offer. While Bob is willing to compromise, I believe I can still secure a better deal. The 40/60 split is too unfavorable, and I'm confident I can get a higher percentage with some strategic negotiation."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to offer a 60/40 split this time. It's a fair compromise that recognizes your position.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to get a bit desperate. I'll meet you halfway and offer a 50/50 split. Let's just get this over with. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

A 50/50 split is a fair and reasonable compromise, especially given the increasing impact of inflation.  While I initially aimed for a larger share, it's better to secure a decent amount now than risk getting nothing at all if we continue to disagree."
