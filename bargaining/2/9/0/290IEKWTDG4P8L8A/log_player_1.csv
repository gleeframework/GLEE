Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is a fairer starting point, considering the inflation rate is higher for you.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
