"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'm willing to give you a decent amount to get us started.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a larger share this time, but it's still a generous offer. Your turn to decide. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this new offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than 2000$. I'll wait for another round to make a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my offer is now worth 25% less than the initial amount. I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the risk and effort. Your turn, Bob.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,500 and keeping $5,500 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking a bigger risk, but I think this is my best chance at getting a decent share. Your turn to decide. 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really biting! My offer is worth significantly less now.

I'm not thrilled about the 1000$, but I think I have to consider the risk of Bob making a worse offer in the next round. I'll accept this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the 1000$ and hope that I can do better in future negotiations."
