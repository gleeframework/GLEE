"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the potential for inflation in the future rounds. Let's get this done! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make my proposal. With a 5% decrease in value for me and a 10% decrease for Alice, I might get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a more reasonable split. Let's settle before the money loses more value!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think we can both do better than this.  Let's find a more equitable solution that reflects the current inflation rates. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlthough the offer seems reasonable, considering the inflation rates, I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the next round. The money is losing value, but Alice is losing more value than I am, so I'll wait and try to get a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Given the increasing inflation, I think this is a generous offer. The money is losing value fast, especially for you, so let's settle this before it's too late!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the inflation is a concern, but I'm not willing to accept a deal where I lose more than 50% of the potential value.  This offer is a fair compromise, considering the current situation.  Let's reach an agreement before the money becomes practically worthless. 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant loss of value due to inflation, especially for Alice, I think this is a fair compromise. If I reject this offer and the game continues, the money will lose even more value, and I might end up with less than what I'm offered now. So, I'll accept this offer and settle the deal."
