Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,

  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money with an 80-20 split in favor of Alice. I believe this is fair considering the risk and potential loss due to inflation.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60-40 is a more reasonable split, considering the risks are still high, but I'm willing to give you a larger share than I received in your offer. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
