Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Let's split it 70-30. This way, we can ensure a fair distribution considering the inflation factor.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split is more equitable, considering your gains are worth less with each round. Let's work together to get something before it's too late! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
