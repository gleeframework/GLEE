"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can reassess as we go along.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's go for a simple 50/50 split.  We both lose money the longer we play. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation rates, my gain of $5,000 is worth 95% of the original $6,000 I proposed, and Bob's gain of $5,000 is worth 80% of the original $6,000 I proposed.

I'm not sure if this is the best option, but I'll accept Bob's offer to move on to the next round.
