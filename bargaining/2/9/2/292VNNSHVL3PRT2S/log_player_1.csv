I'm starting with a 90/10 split in my favor. I'm hoping to get a good deal, but I also want to be fair. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. Even though I'm losing 10% of the value of my share with inflation, I'm still getting significantly less than Bob. I'll take my chances in the next round and see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8100, ""bob_gain"": 1900}
```

I'm offering a new split, but this time, taking into account the inflation.  I'll take 8100, leaving 1900 for Bob. This is still a significant difference, but it's more fair considering the inflation effects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a really tough choice. While I'm losing a significant amount of money due to inflation, accepting this offer would mean I'm getting much less than I was originally aiming for. I'm still holding out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7290, ""bob_gain"": 2710}
```

I'm adjusting my offer again, considering the inflation.  I'll take 7290, leaving 2710 for Bob.  I hope this is fair enough for him to accept, considering the circumstances."
