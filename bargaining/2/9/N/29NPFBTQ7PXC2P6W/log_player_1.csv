"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself, with a message suggesting a 60/40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60/40 is a fair split, but with the potential of inflation, I'd like to start with a bit more for myself. Let's see how you feel about this. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the money is worth less, and Bob's offer is more generous than mine was. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept Bob's offer, as I'd like to aim for a more balanced split, considering the inflation effect. I'll wait for his next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meeting in the middle, let's try 55/45!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,500 and keeping $5,500 for myself, with a message suggesting a 55/45 split, trying to find a middle ground."
