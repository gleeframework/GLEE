I'm going to propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor. I figure this is a good starting point, and I'm confident I can justify it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'll offer a 6000/4000 split. Since Bob rejected my initial offer, I'm willing to be more equitable, but I still need to get a majority of the money."
