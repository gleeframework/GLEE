"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can negotiate from here""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  It's the fairest way to start, and we can adjust from here if needed. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a toll on my gains!

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a reasonable starting point, and splitting it evenly is a fair approach. I'll accept his offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
