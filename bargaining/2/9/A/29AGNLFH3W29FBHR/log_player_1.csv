"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. I'm framing it as a fair split, hoping he'll accept it."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better, let's be more equal this time. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is mirroring my previous offer! I'll have to think carefully about this one.

Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, I'll have to adjust my expectations accordingly. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, I'll try to be more aggressive in my offer to account for the decreased value. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bigger share""
}
```

# Bob gain: 450000
