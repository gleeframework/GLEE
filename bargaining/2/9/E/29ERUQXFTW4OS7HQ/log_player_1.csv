"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\nI'm offering Bob $4000, which is a reasonable amount, and I'll take $6000. The message is a bit cheeky, but I want to start with a strong opening offer. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the value of the money will decrease with each round. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'm not happy with Bob's offer, as I think I can get a better deal. The fact that the money is worth 5% less to me now makes his offer even less appealing. I'll reject it and make a new proposal in the next round. Bring it on!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still want a bigger share""}\n\n###\nI've reduced my initial offer by $200, showing that I'm willing to negotiate. However, I still believe I deserve a larger share, considering the decreasing value of the money for me. Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this revised offer!"
