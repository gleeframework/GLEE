"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. Fair is fair, right? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
I'm Bob, and I want to see if I can get a better deal. Let's see what Alice offers next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than an even split. This way, I get a little more, and you still get a good amount.  What do you say?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob.  Let's split it 4500 for me, 5500 for you.  This way, you get a little more, and we both get a good amount.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd like to see if I can get even more, I think this is a fair offer. Accepting now means I get more than the initial even split, and Alice gets a reasonable amount as well."
