"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 80-20 in my favor.""
}
```

This offer gives me $8,000 and Bob $2,000, with a message suggesting a 4:1 ratio in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's compromise, 60-40 in my favor. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the numbers are now:

Alice gain: 4000 (pre-inflation: 8000)
Bob gain: 6000 (pre-inflation: 12000)

I'll think about it for a moment...

I'll reject this offer. The 60-40 ratio is still too skewed in Bob's favor, and I'd like to try to get a better deal.
