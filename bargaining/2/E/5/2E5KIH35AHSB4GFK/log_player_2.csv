"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the bigger share, but you'll still get something. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While it's tempting to take the $1000, rejecting the offer is the better strategy in the long run.  Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The money is worth less to Bob with each round. Accepting now means missing out on potentially getting a larger share later.
* **Potential for More:** Bob has the power to propose in the next round.  By rejecting, he can potentially get a better deal."
