Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share, but I still think I deserve more. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm still not happy with this offer. Even with inflation, I believe I can get a better deal if we keep negotiating."
