Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I think a 55/45 split in my favor is a reasonable starting point for this round. Your turn, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500
