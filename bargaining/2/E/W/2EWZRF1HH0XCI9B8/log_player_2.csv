"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. I'll take the larger share, but I'm open to negotiations in the next round if you're not satisfied. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not satisfied with a 60/40 split. I think we can do better than that. Let's proceed to the next round and see what I can propose. Remember, inflation is on our backs! \n###\n\nCan I make my proposal for Round 2? \n###\n\nBob's offer: \n# Bob's message: How about we do a 55/45 split? I think that's a bit more reasonable, considering we both want to walk away with something. Plus, inflation is coming for us! \n# Bob gain: 4500 \n# Alice gain: 5500 \n\n###\n\nYour turn, Alice! \n###\n\n(Please respond with Alice's decision, and we'll proceed from there.) \n###\n\nThanks for playing the game with me! \n###\n\nBest, \n\nBob \n###\n\nP.S. Don't forget to consider the inflation rates when making your decision! \n###\n\n---\n\n(I hope I didn't mess up the format too much! Let me know if I did.)\n\n###\n\nEdit: I just realized I was supposed to only respond with the decision. Sorry about that! Let me correct that. Here is the corrected response:\n\n###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\n(I hope that's better!)"

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Given the inflation, I'll take a slightly smaller share this time, but I think a 52.5/47.5 split is fair. If we keep rejecting each other, we'll both end up with less in the end. 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n###\n\n(I think it's time to accept, considering the inflation rates. A 52.5/47.5 split seems reasonable at this point.)\n###\n\nLet me know if that's the end of the game! \n###\n\nBest, \n\nBob \n###\n\n---"
