I'm proposing a 950,000/50,000 split in my favor. This seems like a good starting point, as it gives Bob a small share while ensuring I get the majority.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my initial proposal, and with the inflation factored in, it's not even remotely close to what I would consider a fair deal. I'm going to reject this and see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a 600,000/400,000 split in my favor. This is still a substantial share for me, but it's a more balanced deal than my previous offer. I'm hoping Bob will see it as a compromise and accept it."
