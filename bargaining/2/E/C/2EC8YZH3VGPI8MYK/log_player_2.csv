Alice's offer:

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my offer is still generous. Let's settle this before inflation eats away at our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but this is getting ridiculous.  We both lose if this keeps up. 
# Bob gain: 525000 
# Alice gain: 475000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Reasoning: 

While not ideal, this offer is better than what I'm likely to get if I continue to reject Alice's offers. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, especially for Alice. This makes it less likely she'll offer me a significantly better deal in the remaining rounds.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a better offer carries the risk of getting nothing if we don't reach an agreement. Accepting now guarantees me a reasonable sum. 

It's time to cut my losses and secure a win, even if it's not the ideal amount.
