"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's get a good start! Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $20 and keeping $80 for myself, which is a fair and generous offer considering we have 12 rounds to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a bit more 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a bite!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll have to be more cautious. However, Bob's offer is still a significant compromise, and I don't want to risk losing more value in the next rounds.

I'll accept this offer.
