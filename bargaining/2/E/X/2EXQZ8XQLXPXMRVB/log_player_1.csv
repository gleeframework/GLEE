I'm trying to maximize my share, and this offer is significantly less than what I've been aiming for. I'm willing to take the risk of further rounds."

This is a very close offer, and the pressure is mounting.  However, I still believe I can get a better deal. The inflation is hurting Bob more than me, so I'm hoping he'll come back with a slightly more favorable offer in the next round."

I'm starting to feel the pinch of inflation more acutely, so I'm dropping my offer slightly. However, I'm still aiming for a substantial share. Bob's losses from inflation are increasing, so hopefully this offer will be more appealing."

This is a close call, but the inflation is starting to hurt me significantly. I'm not sure if I can get a better deal in the next round, and Bob's losses are even greater. This offer is a decent compromise, and I'm willing to accept it."
