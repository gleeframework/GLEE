"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80/20, I'll give you a fair chance to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000, leaving Bob with 20%. I'm framing it as a fair split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but still keep some for myself 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $6000 is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $4800. I'm not sure if Bob's gain of $4000 is a good deal for me, considering the inflation.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the inflation and trying to be more aggressive this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You're not giving me enough, I'm taking a bigger share this time!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 70% of the remaining $10,000, leaving Bob with 30%. I'm framing it as a stronger move, hoping to put pressure on Bob to accept or make an even better offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of 
# Alice gain: 6500 
# Bob gain: 3500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $6500 is now worth 51.2% of its original value, which is approximately $3308.80. Considering the previous offers, I think this is a relatively fair deal, and I don't want to risk going to the next round.

I'll accept this offer.
