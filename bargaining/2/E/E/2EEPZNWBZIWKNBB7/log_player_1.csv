"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}

I'm offering you 20% of the initial $100, which is $20. This way, I get the majority of the money, but it's a decent offer, right?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one...

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'd rather get more now than risk waiting for a potentially better offer later. I'll accept this offer.
