"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share. Accept and we can finish the game early.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000, which is a relatively small amount, but it's a fair share considering the game is just starting. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a more fair split, considering the risks of continuing. Let's end this quickly and both get a good amount. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $4,500 is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not sure if this is a good deal, but I'm willing to consider it. I'd rather not risk waiting for a better offer and potentially ending up with nothing. Let's see...

  ""decision"": ""accept""
