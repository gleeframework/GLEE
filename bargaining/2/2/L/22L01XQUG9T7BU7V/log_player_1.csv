"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

This way, I get 70% of the money, and Bob gets 30%. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the middle ground, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Bob's offer is now 50/50, I'll accept it. The money is still worth the same for me, and I get a fair share.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
