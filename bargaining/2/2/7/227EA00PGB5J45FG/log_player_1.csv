"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 70-30, I'm generous!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 30 dollars, which is a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60-40 is fairer. Let's be reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rates, my gain of 40 dollars is worth 95% of the original 70 dollars I could have gotten in the first round, which is $66.

Bob's gain of 60 dollars is worth 80% of the original 30 dollars, which is $24.

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, as it's still a relatively small share for me. I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer. Considering the inflation rates, I'll aim for a higher share for myself.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a decent share, but I'm not going to give away all the money!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 45 dollars, which is worth 75% of the original 30 dollars, and keeping 55 dollars for myself, which is worth 77.5% of the original 70 dollars."
