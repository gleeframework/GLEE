"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55/45 split in my favor.  While I understand the risk of inflation, I believe this split is fairer given that we both have equal opportunity to influence the outcome of future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{
