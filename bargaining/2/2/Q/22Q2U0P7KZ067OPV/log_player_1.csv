I'm starting with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure the deal in the first round.  This way, we both get our share, and I avoid the risk of inflation eating into my potential gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I understand the power dynamics have shifted in his favor due to inflation, I'm not willing to accept such a drastic reduction in my share.  I believe I can still negotiate a more equitable outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 950000, ""bob_gain"": 50000}
```

I'm offering Bob a significantly smaller share than in my first offer.  I'm hoping he'll accept this offer, as the inflation will continue to erode my share if we continue to play."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. Even though my share has been reduced by inflation, I believe I can still negotiate a better outcome in the next round. I'm not willing to accept such a significant loss in my share just yet."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000} 
```

This offer is still generous considering the inflation, but it's a significant step down from my previous offers. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer to avoid further inflation losses on my side."
