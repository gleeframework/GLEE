This is a tough spot. Alice is clearly playing hardball and knows my offers are getting worse with the inflation working against me.  I need to try and push for a slightly better split while there's still time."

It's painful, but I have to accept.  At this point, the inflation is eating away at the potential gains so severely that it's better to take a smaller amount than risk getting nothing at all. Alice knows this and is ruthlessly exploiting the situation."
