Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,
  ""message"": ""I propose we divide the money with a ratio of 3:1 in favor of you, Bob. This should give us both a fair share while considering the decreasing value of money in future rounds.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better with a more even split. I'm willing to take slightly less now, but this will ensure we both get a more equitable share in the long run. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{
