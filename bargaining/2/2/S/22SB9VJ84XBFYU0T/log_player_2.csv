"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a fair split, considering I'm the one making the proposal.  Let's be reasonable! 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While it's tempting to accept, there's a lot of money on the table, and 12 rounds is a long time to get more. I want to see if I can get a better deal later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is fair considering the long game ahead of us. Let's work together to get the most out of this!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob.  I'm willing to compromise a bit.  Let's get this done before the money shrinks too much! 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While 30% is less than the 60% I initially offered, the inflation is starting to bite and the risk of getting nothing at all is increasing. It's time to take what I can get."
