I'm starting with a 90/10 split in my favor. It's a generous offer considering the inflation, but I'm hoping to secure a good amount before it impacts my share too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Bob's offer is a significant drop from the first round, and it doesn't account for the inflation affecting my share. I need to hold out for a better deal, hoping he'll realize he needs to offer more to keep my interest."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I'm reducing my share slightly, but still aiming for a significant portion. I hope this shows Bob I'm willing to compromise while also maintaining a decent share before inflation hits too hard."
