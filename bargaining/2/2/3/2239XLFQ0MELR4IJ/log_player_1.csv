"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, with me getting $70 and Bob getting $30. This is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the inflation rates we are facing. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Given the inflation rates, the money is worth less than before, and I need to adjust my expectations. Bob's offer is a 60-40 split, which is a bit more favorable to him, but considering the inflation rates, I think it's a reasonable proposal.

I'll accept this offer.
