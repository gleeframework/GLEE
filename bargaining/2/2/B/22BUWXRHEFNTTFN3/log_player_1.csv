"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose a 90/10 split, keeping $900,000 for myself and giving Bob $100,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point, considering the potential for inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I propose a 60/40 split, keeping $600,000 for myself and giving Bob $400,000. I believe this is a fair counter-offer considering Bob's previous proposal and the ongoing inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

I propose a 55/45 split, keeping $550,000 for myself and giving Bob $450,000.  I believe this is a fair counter-offer considering Bob's previous proposal and the ongoing inflation. We are now less than halfway through the rounds, and the value of money is rapidly decreasing.  A compromise is necessary to ensure both of us get something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer a larger share, the value of the money is dropping rapidly. Accepting this 50/50 split is the best way to ensure I get something, and prevents the risk of getting nothing at all if we run out of rounds."
