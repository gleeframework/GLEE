"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, see how it goes from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, to see how the game unfolds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than 50/50. I'm willing to give you a bit less this round, but hopefully we can work towards a more equitable split in the future. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's proposal. Since my money is worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's money is worth 20% less, I need to take that into account.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer because I'd like to get a better deal considering the inflation affects Bob's gain more than mine. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the initial 50/50 split. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a fair share and being willing to compromise, while also taking into account the inflation effect on Bob's gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we should split this 50/50. It's been two rounds and we haven't found a compromise. Let's just agree and move on. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob has changed his mind and is now suggesting a 50/50 split again. Considering the inflation has reduced the value of Bob's gain even further, I think this might be a good opportunity to accept a more equal split.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer and split the remaining $10,000 evenly between us."
