Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a bigger share, but we need to reach an agreement soon. The money is losing value with each round. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
It's getting risky to keep rejecting offers, especially with the inflation hitting harder. Let's take this and see what happens!"
