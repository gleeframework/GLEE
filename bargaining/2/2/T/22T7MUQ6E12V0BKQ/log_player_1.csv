"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further""
}
```

This way, we both get $5,000 and the game ends here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly bigger share 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, the $4,000 I'd get is actually worth 80% of the original $5,000, which is $4,000. The $6,000 Bob wants is worth 90% of the original $6,667.33 (50% of $10,000), which is $5,999.40.

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, considering I'd be giving up a significant amount of value. I'll reject this offer.

  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise""

My gain of $4,500 would be worth 51.2% of the original $10,000, which is $5,120.
