Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to go lower, but I still want a fair share considering the initial amount. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is feeling the pressure of the inflation and is lowering her demand, but it's still not a great deal for Bob.  We're getting close to the point where Alice's discounted value will make her offers more appealing to Bob than risking even further losses. By continuing to reject, Bob puts himself in a stronger position for the final rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Alice, it's time to end this.  I'm offering a perfectly equal split.  Take it before the inflation eats away any more of your potential gain.""} 

**Reasoning:**

Now is the time to push for an even split.  The longer the game goes on, the less appealing Alice's offers will become to Bob due to the inflation heavily impacting her share.  By offering a 50/50 split, Bob presents an offer that was initially less appealing to Alice, but due to her time constraints, might now be her best option."
