"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can shake hands!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000, which is a fair share considering the initial amount. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game here!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  Fair is fair. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth 5% less than before, I'm effectively getting 500,000 * 0.95 = 475,000. Still, it's a fair split, and I don't want to risk going to the next round. I'll accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
