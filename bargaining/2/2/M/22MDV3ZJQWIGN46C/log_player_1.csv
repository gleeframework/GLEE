"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping to negotiate a better deal in the future, considering the potential for inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to think carefully about the offer. Since Bob's offer is 50/50, I'll decide to reject it, hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
