I'll start by offering a pretty generous deal. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'll reject this offer. While it's better than the previous round, I'm not willing to settle for such a low percentage yet.  I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'll try to meet Bob halfway with a slightly more even split.  Hopefully, this will be more appealing to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept this offer. While it's still not ideal, the inflation is really starting to take its toll.  I'm not sure I can get a better deal, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all."
