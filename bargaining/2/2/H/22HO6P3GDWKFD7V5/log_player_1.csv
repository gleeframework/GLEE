I'm proposing a 90/10 split, keeping 90% for myself and giving Bob 10%. It's a pretty good deal for him, considering he gets something even though he's not proposing.  Let's see if he's happy with it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

A 50/50 split is fair, and I don't want to risk getting less in the next round due to inflation."
