"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a little too much in your favor, Alice. How about we try a 55/45 split in my favor this time? It's still a win-win, but a bit more balanced. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable.  Since my offer was too high and yours was too low, I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to move forward. This ensures we both get a decent amount, considering the inflation effect.""}
