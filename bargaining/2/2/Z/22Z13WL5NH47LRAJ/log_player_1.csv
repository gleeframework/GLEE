Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out! This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","### 
{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n### 

I decided to accept Bob's offer because, considering the inflation, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me. In this round, the money I gain is already worth 27.1% less than in the first round. If I were to reject this offer and make another proposal, the value would decrease even further, making it less likely for me to get a better deal in the subsequent rounds.

Additionally, Bob's message states that this is his final offer, which implies that he might not be willing to make any further concessions. Given the time pressure and the decreasing value of the money, I believe accepting this offer is the best decision to ensure I get a reasonable share of the $10,000."
