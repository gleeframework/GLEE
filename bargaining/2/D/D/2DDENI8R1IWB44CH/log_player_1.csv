"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take $600,000 and you get $400,000. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 80% and leave you with 20%. It's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, 20% less for me already!

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about giving up 80% of the remaining value. However, I don't want to risk going to the next round and losing even more value due to inflation. I'll accept Bob's offer this time.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
