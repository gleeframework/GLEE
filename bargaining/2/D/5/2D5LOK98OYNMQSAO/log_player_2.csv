"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. Seems fair to me. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nSince the money is worth 10% less for me in each subsequent round, I want to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
