Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, let's settle this 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of my higher inflation rate. While the gap is closing, she's still getting significantly more.  I need to push for a better deal in the next couple of rounds, or I risk getting a truly bad deal as the deadline approaches."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""This is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the fairest option.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The pressure is on now. Offering an even split might seem risky, but:

* **Time Sensitivity:** We are past the halfway point.  The longer this goes on, the worse it gets for me. 
* **Signaling Fairness:** Continuously pushing for a slightly better deal could backfire, making me seem greedy and unwilling to compromise. A 50/50 split is a strong signal that I'm serious about settling and being fair. 

Alice might try to push for a slight advantage in the next round or two, but if she's also feeling the pressure, this offer gives her a clean and justifiable way to end the game."
