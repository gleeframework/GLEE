"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. It's a decent starting point, but I can likely do better by playing the long game and leveraging the inflation to my advantage."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}
``` 

I'm offering Alice a smaller share than she proposed, hoping to incentivize her to accept quickly. I'm confident that I can secure a more favorable split over the next few rounds due to the higher inflation rate impacting her share more significantly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

Alice is still proposing a lower share for me than the initial round, and the inflation is really starting to bite into her share. I'm confident I can get a better deal by continuing to play the long game."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm increasing my proposed share again, hoping to make it more appealing to Alice while still benefiting from the increasing inflation that is affecting her more heavily.  I want to see if she's willing to accept before the inflation becomes too much of a factor for her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I would ideally prefer a larger share, the inflation is starting to heavily impact both of us. This offer provides an equal split, and the potential for further loss with each round is significant.  Accepting this offer ensures I receive a substantial amount and avoids the risk of ending up with nothing."
