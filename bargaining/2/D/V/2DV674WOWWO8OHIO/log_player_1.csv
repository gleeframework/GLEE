"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{

  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'll reassess the offer.

For Round 2, I'll calculate the value of the money as follows:

Alice's gain: 600,000 * 0.95 (5% less) = 570,000
Bob's gain: 400,000 * 0.8 (20% less) = 320,000

Considering the values, I'll decide to reject this offer.
