"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 

I propose to take 999,999 for myself and leave Bob with 1 dollar.  Since I am starting the game, I want to secure the majority of the money right away. It is unlikely Bob will accept this offer, but it sets a precedent for the future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I would prefer to have more, accepting this offer ensures I get a significant amount of money.  The risk of rejection in the next round could lead to a much worse outcome for me."
