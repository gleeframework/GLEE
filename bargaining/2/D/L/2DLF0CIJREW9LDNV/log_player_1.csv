"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you can take 40%""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. This is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share, but I think it's important that we both get a good deal. Let's see if this works for you. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I need to reassess the offer.

I'm not sure if I want to accept an offer that's even closer to a 50-50 split. I'd rather try to negotiate for a better deal. I'll reject this offer and see if I can do better in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth 20% less for me, so I'll need to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share. Can we compromise?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $460,000 and keeping $540,000 for myself. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
