"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $30 and keep $70.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, which is a fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share this time. Your turn to decide. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob's trying to take a bigger share!

I'll reject this offer. The money is worth 20% less now, and I don't want to give Bob 80% of the remaining value.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 20% less again, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle this time. 50-50 split.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slight majority this time. You can try to negotiate. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money keeps decreasing!

I'll reject this offer as well. I don't want to give Bob 60% of the remaining value.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly!

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'll compromise this time. You can have a slight majority, but I'll hold on to 40.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my proposal to give Bob a slight majority, hoping he'll accept this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging on my majority, but I'll give you a smaller share this time. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is plummeting!

I'll reject this offer again. Giving Bob 80% of the remaining value is too much for me.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now!

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 30,
  ""bob_gain"": 70,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bigger share, but I need to keep something for myself. 30 is the minimum I'll accept.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise, but I'm not willing to give up more than 30."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting desperate, but I still want the majority. You can try to negotiate. 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is almost gone!

I'll reject this offer. Giving Bob 90% of the remaining value is unacceptable, and I'm not willing to give up 90% of what's left.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The money is almost worthless now!

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5,
  ""bob_gain"": 95,
  ""message"": ""I'm not getting anything, so you might as well take it all. I'll let you have 95% of what's left.""
}
```

I'm being realistic about the situation and acknowledging that the value of the money is almost gone."
