"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money 70/30 in your favor. This should give us a fair deal considering the risk. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's too risky to accept such a low offer in the first round. There's a chance that Alice might not get a better deal later on, making her accept my offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 800000, ""alice_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""I'm offering you 20% and keeping 80%. It's a fair split considering the potential for inflation. Let's end this quickly and both get a decent share.""}
