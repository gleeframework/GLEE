Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it down the middle.  We both lose value with each round, so a 50/50 split is the fairest option right now. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000

{
""bob_gain"": 5800,
""alice_gain"": 4200,

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try to meet in the middle.  I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not comfortable with a 58/42 split. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting desperate and starting to offer more, but the deal still isn't in Bob's favor considering the rapid devaluation of Alice's share.  Bob needs to hold firm for a bit longer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6200,
""alice_gain"": 3800,
""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time. This offer heavily favors me, but it's the only way to get a deal that makes sense for both of us given the rapid devaluation.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

The clock is ticking and this offer reflects the urgency. It's a strong stance, but the justification is clear and might be enough to get Alice to accept before the money shrinks even further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're both losing value quickly. This offer is the closest I can get to a fair split while still ensuring we both get something. 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Time to cut the losses.  While not ideal, this offer is better than what Bob could get if he rejects and negotiates in later rounds with the increasingly devalued money.  Alice is unlikely to offer more."
