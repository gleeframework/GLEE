``` 

Even with the 20% inflation, 2000$ is a small amount, and Alice gets the lion's share. I want to see if I can negotiate a better deal."

I'm still not happy with this offer.  While Alice's share is a bit lower, I'm getting a significantly smaller amount than I want. I'm willing to take a risk and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."

# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500

{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is getting worse, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal. I'm not sure how much longer I can hold out, but I'm going to try to push for a better split in the next round."

# Alice's message: I'm running out of options, but I'll give you one last chance to make a deal. This is my final offer 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice's offer is still bad, but it's my last chance to get anything. Inflation is hitting me hard, and I'm running out of time. I'd rather get a small amount than risk getting nothing at all."
