Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Your turn! How about a slight adjustment for a win-win?""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:**  It's crucial to consider the decreasing value of the money. While Alice's offer seemed decent initially, the longer the game goes, the less favorable it becomes for me (Bob) due to the higher inflation rate.
* **Strategic Advantage:** By rejecting and making a counter-offer, I signal that I'm not simply accepting the first offer and am looking for a more beneficial split.
* **Offer Explanation:** My offer of $5200 for myself and $4800 for Alice is a shift in my favor, taking into account the inflation disadvantage I face. The message aims to frame it as a mutually beneficial adjustment rather than a hostile rejection of her initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Counteroffer, considering the inflation, this is more than fair! 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Losing Ground:** Even though Alice acknowledges the inflation, her offer still puts me at a significant disadvantage. Losing 36% of the potential gain is substantial, and her offer doesn't compensate for it nearly enough.
* **Late Game Leverage:**  As we progress into later rounds, Alice's incentive to secure a deal increases.  If she rejects this offer, she faces the risk of getting an even smaller portion in future rounds.
* **Aiming for a Better Split:** I believe it's worth risking another round to aim for a more equitable split, considering the rapid devaluation of the money."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Let's end this. A 50/50 split ensures we both benefit before inflation eats away more.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  The inflation is rapidly eroding the value of the money. Every round that passes makes the potential gains significantly smaller for both of us.
* **Fairness Appeal:**  A 50/50 split is inherently fair and easy for Alice to accept.  It removes the complexity of negotiating over increasingly smaller gains.
* **Preventing Losses:**  While I was aiming for a slightly larger share, continuing to reject offers risks pushing Alice towards a desperate low offer in later rounds, potentially leaving us both with far less. A 50/50 split guarantees a decent outcome despite the inflation."
