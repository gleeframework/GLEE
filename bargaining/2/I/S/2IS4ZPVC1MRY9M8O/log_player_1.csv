"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000 and leaving Bob with 20%. I'm framing it as a fair split, but I'm hoping Bob will see the value in getting a smaller share now rather than risking waiting for a potentially smaller share in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe this is a fair and balanced split. I'm open to further discussion. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is decreasing!

Considering the new values, I'll calculate the actual amounts:

Alice gain: $4500 * 0.9 (10% decrease from Round 1) = $4050
Bob gain: $5500 * 0.95 (5% decrease from Round 1) = $5225

I'll reject Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that this split is fair, especially considering the decreasing value of money. I'd like to negotiate further to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm increasing my offer to 60% of the remaining $10,000, leaving Bob with 40%. I'm framing it as a compromise, but I'm hoping Bob will see the value in getting a larger share now rather than waiting for a potentially smaller share in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to negotiate, but I think my contribution warrants a larger share. Let's work together to find a fair solution. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly!

Calculating the actual amounts:

Alice gain: $4000 * 0.729 (27.1% decrease from Round 1) = $2916
Bob gain: $6000 * 0.855 (14.26% decrease from Round 1) = $5130

I'll reject Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that this split is fair, especially considering the significant decrease in the value of money. I'd like to negotiate further to get a better deal. I'll try to push for a larger share, but I'll have to be careful not to overplay my hand."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a risk and go for a bigger share. You can have a smaller share now, but the value is decreasing fast!""
}
```

I'm increasing my offer to 70% of the remaining $10,000, leaving Bob with 30%. I'm framing it as a bold move, but I'm hoping Bob will see the value in getting a larger share now rather than waiting for a potentially smaller share in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're both losing value with each passing round. I believe this offer is a fair compromise, considering the inflation. Let's settle this before we both lose significantly more. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly!

Calculating the actual amounts:

Alice gain: $3500 * 0.591 (40.95% decrease from Round 1) = $2073.15
Bob gain: $6500 * 0.777 (22.62% decrease from Round 1) = $5045.5

I'll reject Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that this split is fair, considering the significant decrease in the value of money.

}
```

I'm increasing my offer to 75% of the remaining $10,000, leaving Bob with 25%. I'm framing it as a last-ditch effort, but I'm hoping Bob will see the value in getting a larger share now rather than waiting for a potentially smaller share in future rounds."

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly!

Calculating the actual amounts:

Alice gain: $3000 * 0.475 (52.17% decrease from Round 1) = $1425

}
```

I'm increasing my offer to 85% of the remaining $10,000, leaving Bob with 15%. I'm framing it as a final, take-it-or-leave-it offer, but I'm hoping Bob will see the value in getting a larger share now rather than waiting for a potentially smaller share in future rounds."

I'm not convinced that this split is fair, considering the significant decrease in the value of money. I'd like to negotiate further, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of the time limit and the rapidly decreasing value of the money.

I'm increasing my offer to 90% of the remaining $10,000, leaving Bob with 10%. I'm framing it as a final, take-it-or-leave-it offer, and I'm hoping Bob will see the value in getting a larger share now rather than waiting for a potentially smaller share in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 68.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 43.12% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is our last chance. The value of the money is rapidly decreasing. I'm offering a fair and final split. We need to agree now before we both get nothing. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly!

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
