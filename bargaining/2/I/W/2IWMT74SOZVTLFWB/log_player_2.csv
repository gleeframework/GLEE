"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. Let's split it 90/10. You get the smaller share, but we both get something!

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable. I'm willing to give you a larger share, but we need to compromise. 70/30 seems like a fair deal, considering the value of the money is declining with each round. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is trying to take advantage, but I still have time to negotiate a better deal."

Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both benefit before inflation eats away at the value. Take it or leave it.""}"
