"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than that.  Let's split it 65-35 to start. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, the money is worth less, but I'm still not thrilled about the split.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think the split is still too skewed towards Bob. I'd like to try to negotiate a more even split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, 55-45?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, trying to find a more balanced compromise."
