"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 70,
""bob_gain"": 30,
""message"": ""Let's be fair, Bob. I'm offering you 30% to start.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that. I'm offering you 40% to start things off. Let's work together to find a fair deal. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a tough one! Bob's offer is tempting, but letting the rounds go on diminishes returns for both of us. Let's analyze:

* **Bob's Offer:** 40% sounds good, but due to inflation, it's actually worth only 40 * 0.8 = $32 in round 1 value.
* **Potential Future Offer:** If I reject, I can propose in the next round. However, even if I aim for a 50/50 split, inflation will eat into my share. 

Considering the rapid devaluation and the risk of ending up with nothing, I'll accept Bob's offer, hoping he'll be more generous in future games.
