"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal! This offer ensures you get a decent share while maximizing my gain. Consider the decreasing value over time - accepting now is in your best interest.

# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair! Given the 10% decrease in value for me each round, this offer is more than reasonable. We both get a significant share, and it's better for both of us to agree now rather than lose more value.""} \n\n###"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the situation with the decreasing value, but your previous offer was too low for me. This offer is a compromise - it still gives me a significant share while offering you considerably more than before. Accepting now prevents further losses for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","### {""bob_gain"": 350000, ""alice_gain"": 650000, ""message"": ""Considering the 19% decrease in value for me and the fact that we both want a significant share, this offer splits the difference fairly. Further rounds will only decrease the value for me, making it less beneficial for both of us to delay an agreement.""} \n\n###"
