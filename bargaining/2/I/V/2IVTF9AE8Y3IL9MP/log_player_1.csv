"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  I figure this is a fair starting point, as I'm the one making the first offer and am taking a risk by letting you decide."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I'm not happy with a 50/50 split, especially since I'm the one taking the risk of rejection. I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm going to offer a slightly lower split, 80/20 in my favor, but still keeping it fair, considering the inflation affecting Bob's share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not going to accept a 40/60 split when I've been offered better deals in the past. I'll try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm going to continue to offer a split in my favor, but I'm also going to keep in mind the increasing inflation.  I'm offering 70/30, hoping to find a compromise that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still not satisfied with a 30/70 split, and with inflation hitting Bob harder, I think I can get a better deal in the next round."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm offering a 60/40 split, hoping to find a compromise that's better for both of us. With each round, the risk of getting nothing increases, and I think this offer reflects that."
