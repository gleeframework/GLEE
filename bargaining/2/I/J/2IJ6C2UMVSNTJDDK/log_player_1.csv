"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a good foundation!""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $800,000, and Bob gets the remaining 20%, which is $200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, 50/50 is the best way to start. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about the 50/50 split, as I was hoping for a better deal. I think I can do better than this. I'll reject the offer and make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
