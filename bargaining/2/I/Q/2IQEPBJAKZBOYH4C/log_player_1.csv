"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair to start with. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting Bob's gain, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since my gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'm still getting a larger share than Bob. However, I'll have to consider the fact that Bob's gain is worth 20% less due to inflation.

After weighing my options, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob's offer in the previous round was 400,000 for me and 600,000 for him, I'll try to adjust my offer to be more favorable to myself, considering that my gain is still worth the same as in the first round. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

Let's analyze Bob's offer: he's offering me 450,000, which is worth the same as in the first round, and himself 550,000, which is worth 10.2% more than his previous offer in round 2. Considering that my gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I think this offer is a bit more favorable to Bob.

However, I'll still consider it carefully. Since I'm still getting a significant share, and my gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
