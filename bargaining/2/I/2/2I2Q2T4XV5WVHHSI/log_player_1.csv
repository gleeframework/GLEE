"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with this""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I get 60% of the $100 and Bob gets 40%. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'd like to see if Bob agrees."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not happy about the 60-40 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Since Bob is now proposing a 60-40 split, I think I can do better.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a 60-40 split, I'll try to push for a slightly more favorable split for myself. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""A slight adjustment to account for the inflation, let's try this""}

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which is a slightly more favorable split for me than the 60-40 split Bob proposed earlier. Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this offer."
