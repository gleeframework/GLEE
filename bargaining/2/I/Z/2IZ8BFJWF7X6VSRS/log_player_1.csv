I'm going to start with a proposal that favors me slightly.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm not going to accept that offer. Bob is now trying to take advantage of the inflation, and I'm not going to let him get away with it.  I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm going to try to compromise, but I'm still going to try to get the majority of the money. Bob's offer was too greedy, and I'm hoping he'll realize that we need to find a more balanced solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still being too greedy, and the inflation is really starting to hurt me now.  I'm not going to accept this, but I'm running out of time. I need to find a way to negotiate a fairer deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway.  I'm taking a bigger hit from inflation than he is, but I'm hoping this offer will be enough to make him see that we need to reach an agreement soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's greed knows no bounds! This inflation is taking a huge toll on me, but I refuse to be taken advantage of. I'm going to try one last time to reach a compromise, but if he continues to be unreasonable, we'll both end up with nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

We're both losing money with every passing round. It's time to split the difference and avoid getting nothing.  I'm hoping Bob will finally see reason."
