"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good deal!""}\n\nI'm offering Bob 40% of the total amount, which is a relatively generous offer considering I'm trying to maximize my gain. The message is an attempt to persuade Bob that this is a fair deal and that he should accept it. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a larger share, but I need a bigger cut to make it worthwhile. How about this? 
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, although the money is worth less now due to inflation, I believe I can still negotiate for a better deal. Since the money is worth 10% less for me and only 5% less for Bob, I want to try to get a larger share to compensate for the greater loss in value. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise. This is the best I can offer.""}\n\nIn this round, I'm taking into account the effects of inflation and trying to find a middle ground. Since the money is worth less for both of us, I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable offer and accept it. I've decreased my initial offer slightly to show that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still trying to get the better end of the deal. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is a difficult negotiation. I'm trying to meet you halfway considering the inflation. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 530000 
# Bob gain: 470000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI've decided to accept Bob's offer in this round. Considering the significant decrease in value due to inflation, especially for me, I think this is a reasonable deal. Bob's message suggests that this is his final offer, and I don't want to risk losing even more value by continuing to negotiate. At this point, I believe it's better to secure the 530,000 rather than risking further devaluation. Let's end the game here!"
