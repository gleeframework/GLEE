# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate as her potential gains rapidly shrink.  While her offer is closer to a reasonable split, I believe she'll be forced to concede even more in the next round as the deadline looms closer."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5100, ""alice_gain"": 4900, ""message"": ""Alice, time is running out. This is my final offer - take it or leave it.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  With only 6 rounds left, the pressure is mounting on Alice. Her potential gains are shrinking rapidly, making her more likely to accept a less favorable deal.
* **Slight Concession:**  Offering $4900 is a small concession from my previous offer, signaling a willingness to negotiate, but maintaining a firm stance.
* **Ultimatum:**  Framing this as my ""final offer"" creates a sense of urgency and may push Alice to accept before her options dwindle further."
