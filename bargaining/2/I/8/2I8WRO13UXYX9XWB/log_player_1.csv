"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}

I'm going to start with a very aggressive offer. I want to maximize my potential gain in the first round, knowing that the value of money will decrease in subsequent rounds.  This also puts the pressure on Bob to accept, or risk losing even more in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is significantly better than the one I proposed, I'm still in a position of power. I know the inflation is working in my favor, and I can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  I'm confident I can get a larger share in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm going to offer a 50/50 split in this round. Bob rejected my aggressive offer in round 1, and while he got a good deal in round 2, I rejected it.  This shows I'm willing to compromise. A 50/50 split is a fair and reasonable offer. With each round, the value of the money decreases, so it's in both our best interests to reach an agreement."
