"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 10% and keep the rest.""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob 10% of the total amount, which is a relatively fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I think I deserve more for being the one to make the next offer 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of 200,000 is now worth 180,000 (90% of 200,000).

I'm not thrilled with this offer, as I'd like to get a larger share, but I'll consider it. I'll accept this offer for now, as it's better than going to the next round and risking a worse offer due to further inflation.
