Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'll reject this offer.  It's a good starting point, but I want to see if I can get more.  Let's see what Alice offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}
``` 
I'm offering Alice $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. I believe this is a fair split, considering I'm the one proposing."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer to get more, the inflation is starting to take effect, and I don't want to risk losing even more money. This offer is slightly better than what I offered in round 2, and it's worth taking."
