"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 70/30, I'll give you a fair chance to negotiate""
}
```

This way, I'll get 70% of the initial 100$, and Bob will get 30%. I'm leaving room for negotiation, hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you in the middle, let's split it evenly 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to reassess the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept an even split, as I'd rather try to negotiate for a better deal. I'll wait for Bob's next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In this round, the money is worth 20% less than in the second round, and Bob's offer is worth 5% less than in the second round. I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slight edge, but I need more than 45""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 45% of the remaining value, while I'll take 55%. I'm leaving room for negotiation, but I'm not giving away too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slight edge, but I'm willing to give you a fair deal 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering the significant decrease in value, I'll reassess the offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer of 45% for me and 55% for him. The decreased value of the money makes this offer more attractive than risking further negotiations."
