"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

I'm going to start with a very lopsided offer.  It's unlikely Bob will accept, but it's a good starting point to see if he's willing to negotiate.  I'm hoping to get as much of the money as possible before inflation takes its toll."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer.  While it's tempting to take even a small amount, the inflation rate is too high to accept such a small portion of the money.  I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob 100,000. This is still a very high percentage for him, but it's a significant reduction from my last offer, accounting for the inflation. I'm hoping this is a fair enough offer that he'll accept, as the inflation will continue to hurt me if we go further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's a big jump from Bob's previous offer, the inflation rate is still significant, and I'm confident I can do better. The next round is my turn to make an offer, and I'll try to negotiate a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm offering Bob 200,000, which is more than his last offer, but still a significant chunk of the money for me. I'm hoping this is a good compromise, given the inflation.  I'm running out of time, and I need to strike a deal soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough one. While the inflation has severely hurt my potential earnings, accepting this offer gives me at least *something*.  I'm not sure I can get a better deal given the rapidly shrinking value of the money I'd gain.  I'll accept and hope I can make better decisions next time."
