Let's see if I can get a better deal."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, but I think a 60-40 split in my favor is more fair. What do you think?""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, 58-42 is a fairer split. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer more, the inflation is starting to bite. 58-42 is a decent compromise."
