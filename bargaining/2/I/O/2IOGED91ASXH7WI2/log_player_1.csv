"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $80 and Bob gets $20."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. This way we both get a fair share right away. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money, my gain of $50 is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so it's actually $45.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
