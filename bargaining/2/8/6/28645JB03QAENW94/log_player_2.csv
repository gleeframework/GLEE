"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to reject this offer. Even though it's a 50/50 split right now, there's a chance I can get more if I wait and see what Alice proposes next.  I know the money will be worth less each round, but I want to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}
``` 

I'm going to propose a 60/40 split in my favor. While I know the money will be worth less in the next round, I'm taking a gamble that Alice will accept this offer.  A 60/40 split seems fair considering I'm taking the risk of being left with a smaller share if we continue."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5200 
# Alice gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though I'm getting a slightly smaller share than in the first round, it's still a decent deal considering the inflation.  There's no guarantee that Alice will offer me anything better in the next round.  It's better to take the sure thing now."
