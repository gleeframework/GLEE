"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This way, I'll get $6,000 and Bob will get $4,000. It's a fair and generous offer, if I do say so myself!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation taking a toll on my gains, I'll have to be more cautious. After considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Time to make a new proposal. Considering the effects of inflation, my offer is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800
}
```"
