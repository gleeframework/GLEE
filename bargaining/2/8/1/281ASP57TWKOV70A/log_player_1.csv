"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide it fairly, 60% for me, 40% for you. We both get a good amount, and we avoid losing value due to inflation.""} \n\nHow's that? I tried to make a reasonable offer, taking into account that I want to get a good share, but also making sure Bob gets a decent amount, so he's more likely to accept and we can avoid further rounds and the loss of value due to inflation. Let me know what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, as it's closer to an even split.  Let's avoid unnecessary risk of losing money to inflation and end the game on a good note. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""} \n\nI'm not ready to accept a 55/45 split, as I initially proposed a 60/40 split in my favor and I still believe I can get a better deal. I'm willing to take the risk of losing some value due to inflation in hopes of getting a more favorable offer in the next round. Let's proceed! What's the next step?"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 570000, ""bob_gain"": 430000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, let's meet in the middle between my initial 60/40 offer and your 55/45 offer. This way, we both get a decent share, and we can stop losing value to inflation.""} \n\nI've decided to make a compromise offer, trying to find a middle ground between our previous proposals. This way, I'm showing that I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial agreement, while still pushing for a slightly better deal for myself. Let's see how Bob reacts!"
