"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the money and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the value of money will decrease for me in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I still get the same value for my share as in the previous round. However, the money Bob gains is worth 10% less, so I need to take that into account.

Let's calculate the actual values:

My gain: 45 (as proposed by Bob) is worth 45 dollars, which is 75% of the original 60 dollars I proposed in the first round.
Bob's gain: 55 (as proposed by Bob) is worth 49 dollars, which is 90% of the original 55 dollars Bob would have gotten in the first round.

Considering the value of money is decreasing for Bob, but not for me, I think this offer is a good compromise. I'll accept it.
