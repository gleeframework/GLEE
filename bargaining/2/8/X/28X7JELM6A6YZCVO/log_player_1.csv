Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me $600,000 and leaving $400,000 for Bob."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: I think 60-40 is a fairer split, considering I'm the one making the offer this round.  Let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I'll have to adjust my decision.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than 40% in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth 10% less than in round 2, and Bob's offer in round 2 is worth 5% less than in round 1. I'll take that into account.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You said 60-40 was fair, but I think I deserve a bit more this round!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, giving me $550,000 and leaving $450,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I think 57.5-42.5 is a fair split considering the inflation we're facing.  Let's end this game. 
# Alice gain: 425000 
# Bob gain: 575000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll!

Considering the significant decrease in value, I think I should take the offer. Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer, taking $425,000 and leaving $575,000 for Bob. It's better than continuing to negotiate and risking even lower values in future rounds."
