"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can finalize.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself. This is a relatively even split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept to get the game started!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's time to be more even-handed. This is my offer.  Accept and we can both go home happy. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to mirror my original offer, but with a slight adjustment. However, I'm not going to fall for it!

```

I'll reject Bob's offer and wait for the next round. I'm hoping to get a better deal!"
