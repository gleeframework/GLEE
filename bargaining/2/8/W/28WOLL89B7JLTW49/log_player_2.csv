Alice's offer:

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try to meet in the middle this time. I'm willing to give up some of my share, but I need to make sure I get a good deal for myself. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving towards a more even split, it's still heavily in her favor. The longer this goes on, the more I lose to inflation. I need to push for a better deal before the value diminishes significantly."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting impatient, Bob. Let's try to find a solution quickly, or we both lose out. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is inching closer, but it's still not a good deal considering the impact of inflation.  We're past the halfway point, and I need to make it clear I'm willing to walk away if I don't get a fairer share.  The next offer I send needs to be my firm line, and if she rejects, I may have to accept a less favorable outcome in the later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""This is my final offer, Alice. A 50/50 split is the only fair solution. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to lay down the law.  A 50/50 split is the most equitable solution, and it eliminates any potential arguments about fairness.  By stating this is my final offer, I'm conveying the seriousness of the situation. Alice knows the clock is ticking and further negotiation might lead to both of us losing. She's been consistently getting closer to a 50/50 split, so there's a chance she'll accept. If not, I'll have to reassess my strategy in later rounds based on her response and the increasing pressure from inflation."
