Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better.  Let's split it 55/45, with me taking the larger share. This ensures we both get a fair deal and avoids the risk of inflation diminishing the value of our gains. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
