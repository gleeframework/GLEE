"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000 and leave Bob with 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 0% less for me, but 10% less for Bob, I'll have to weigh the value of the offer carefully.

I accept Bob's offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
