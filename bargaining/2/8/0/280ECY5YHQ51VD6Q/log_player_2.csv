"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and divide it 60-40, I'm willing to compromise! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's better to see if I can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, but I think a 60-40 split in my favor is more fair. Let's see if you're willing to compromise.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still willing to compromise, but I think 58-42 is a more reasonable split. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
It's a slight improvement from my previous offer and Alice is losing more value due to inflation, so it's a good time to accept."
