"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60 dollars and leave 40 dollars for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a smaller share now, but I think I deserve more after this round 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, my gain of 20 dollars is actually 16 dollars in real value.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with Bob taking 80 dollars, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept this offer.
