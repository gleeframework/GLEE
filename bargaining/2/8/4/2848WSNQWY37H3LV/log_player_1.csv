"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
``` 
 
I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. This seems like a fair starting point, as I am the one taking the risk of losing money if we don't agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
I accept this offer. While I am losing some of the potential gain, I am also risking losing more by rejecting and continuing. A 50/50 split is fair in this situation."
