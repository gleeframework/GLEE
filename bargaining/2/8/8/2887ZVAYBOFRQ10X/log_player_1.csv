"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1} 
```

This is a very simple offer, as I want to see if Bob is willing to be very unfair to ensure he gets something.  I want to see if he understands the value of getting *something* in the first round, even if it's a very small amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, getting 600,000 is better than nothing, especially considering the inflation."
