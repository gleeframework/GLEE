"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take it or leave it, I'm not going for a small share. 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $2500 is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $2000.

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I don't want to risk going to the next round with even less value. I'll accept this offer.
