"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 40% and keep 60%""
}
```

This is my opening offer, I'm giving Bob 40% of the total amount, which is $40, and I'm keeping 60%, which is $60. Let's see if Bob will accept or reject this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fairer.  Let's go with 55/45. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round.

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think 55/45 is a bit too skewed towards Bob's favor, and I'd like to negotiate further. I'd like to propose a more even split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 81% of what it was in the first round (90% of 90% is 81%).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 50/50 split, no more negotiations!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair to me. Will Bob accept this offer?"
