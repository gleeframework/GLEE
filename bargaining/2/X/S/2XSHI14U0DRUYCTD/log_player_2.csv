"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. I'm taking a larger hit from inflation. 55/45 reflects the shrinking value and gets us both a decent deal. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500
