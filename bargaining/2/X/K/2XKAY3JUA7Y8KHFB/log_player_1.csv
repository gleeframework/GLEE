"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the $100, and Bob gets 30%. I'm starting with a fair split, but I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal for myself as the game goes on!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  It's the fairest way to start. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, the actual value of the money I would get from Bob's offer is:

$50 * 0.8 = $40

I would get $40, and Bob would get $50. Since I'm getting a smaller share due to inflation, I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal. I'll reject Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, and I've already rejected Bob's offer, I'll try to get a better deal for myself. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""You said it's fair, but I think I deserve a bit more""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the $100, and Bob gets 40%. I'm referencing Bob's previous message about fairness, but I'm trying to negotiate a slightly better deal for myself."
