"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's divide fairly, I get a bit more 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While Alice's offer is somewhat fair, I'm going to see if I can get a better deal for myself. The inflation rate is going to hurt Alice more than it hurts me, so I'm hoping to capitalize on that in the later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than that. Let's split it 60/40 in my favor, considering the inflation will hit you harder than it will me.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm willing to give you a bit less than before, but still a fair share 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

Alice is still offering a pretty good deal, but I'm still holding out hope that I can get a better split.  The inflation is really hurting Alice, and I'm betting she'll start to get desperate as we move through more rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""I'm starting to feel like this is getting a bit ridiculous. How about we split it 65/35 in my favor?  With the inflation, you're getting a worse deal with every round. Let's end this before it gets any worse for both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not giving up yet. Considering the inflation, I'll try to meet you halfway, but I still want a fair share 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

Alice is still holding out, but I'm starting to think I can get a better deal.  The inflation is hitting her hard, and I'm willing to be patient and see if she'll crack in a few more rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Look, we're both losing money with each passing round.  I'm willing to split it 70/30 in my favor, but I'm not going to budge any further. This is a fair deal considering the inflation, and it's time to end this game.""}
