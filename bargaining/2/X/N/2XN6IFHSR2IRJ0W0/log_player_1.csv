"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 80/20 in my favor. You can try to do better if you want.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is 20% of the original $10,000. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a fair deal, but I want more than 40% 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 4000 / 0.95 = 4210.53
* Bob gain: 6000 / 0.95 = 6315.79

I'm not sure I want to give Bob such a large share. I'll reject this offer.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you in the middle, 55/45. Don't expect me to give you more!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,500, which is 45% of the original $10,000. I'm hoping this is more to his liking."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you in the middle, but I think I deserve more for taking the risk 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts considering the 14.26% decrease in value:

* Alice gain: 4500 / 0.8587 ≈ 5221.51
* Bob gain: 5500 / 0.8587 ≈ 6381.49

I'm not sure I want to give Bob such a large share, especially since he's trying to justify it as a reward for taking a risk. I'll reject this offer.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit less, but I'm not budging much. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is 40% of the original $10,000. I'm trying to find a balance between giving him a decent share and not giving him too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you at 50/50, but I'm not going to give you a better deal 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts considering the 22.62% decrease in value:

* Alice gain: 5000 / 0.7778 ≈ 6439.33
* Bob gain: 5000 / 0.7778 ≈ 6439.33

It looks like we're finally at a 50/50 split! I'm willing to accept this offer and end the game.
