"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

This means I'm offering to give myself $600,000 and Bob $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $550,000 is worth 80% of $600,000, and Bob's gain of $450,000 is worth 90% of $500,000.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
