"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a clean slate. Accept and we can move on to the next round.""
}
```

This offer is straightforward: I'm proposing that I get all $100, and Bob gets $0. The message is a friendly one, inviting Bob to accept the offer and start fresh for the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm offering you 10 dollars, but it's better than nothing.  Let's make a deal. 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","In Round 2, I'll consider Bob's proposal. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the offer based on the nominal value of the money.

I'll reject this offer. I'd like to get more money, and 10 dollars is a relatively small share of the total. I'll wait for a better offer. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle. A fair start to the next round.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving us both a fair share of the remaining $100. The message is friendly and inviting, hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer."
