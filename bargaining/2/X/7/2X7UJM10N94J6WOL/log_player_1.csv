Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob's message: I propose a more equal distribution considering the risk of inflation. We both receive half of the amount, ensuring fairness. 
# Alice gain: 5500
