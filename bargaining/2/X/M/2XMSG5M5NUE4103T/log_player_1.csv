"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose to keep $9,000 and give Bob $1,000. This seems like a fair starting point, considering the inflation factor will affect Bob more than me in the coming rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
