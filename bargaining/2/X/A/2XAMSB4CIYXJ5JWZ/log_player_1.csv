Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This is a pretty aggressive offer, but I want to secure a large share early on before the inflation hurts my side more than Bob's.  Let's see if he'll bite!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is way too lopsided, and even though it's my turn to make the proposal in the next round, I'm confident I can get a better deal. Inflation is starting to impact the value of the money, but I'm not giving up this much just yet."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000} 
```

I'm lowering my share a bit to be more reasonable, but I still want to keep the majority. I'm hoping Bob sees that I'm willing to negotiate and we can reach a deal before the inflation hits too hard."
