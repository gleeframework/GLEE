"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80/20, I'll give you a chance to make a better offer next round!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, and I'll take $8,000. The message is a friendly reminder that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm starting strong with an 80/20 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but still a good compromise 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Thanks for the update on the inflation rate.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll think for a moment...

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take $6,000 and Bob will take $4,000. It's a good compromise, and I'm willing to end the game here."
