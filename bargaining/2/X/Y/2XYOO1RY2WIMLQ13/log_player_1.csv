Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was unfair. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, but your offer wasn't realistic given the inflation. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. Let's close the deal before the money loses more value.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time pressure:**  Each round makes the money worth less, especially for me (Alice).  I need to apply pressure for a quicker resolution.
* **Understanding inflation:** Bob's offer in Round 2 showed he doesn't fully grasp how quickly the money is devaluing. My message reinforces this. 
* **Strong but fair:** A 55/45 split in my favor is still a better deal for me than what Bob offered, but it's less extreme than my initial 60/40. This might make him more likely to accept."
