"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
```

I propose a split of $999,000 for me and $1,000 for Bob. This is a very generous offer in the first round, as the inflation risk is minimal. I am hoping Bob will accept this to secure a small amount of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much lower than my initial offer, and while I am aware of the inflation, it is still too early in the game for me to accept such a significant reduction. I will reject the offer and see what Bob proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose a split of $900,000 for me and $100,000 for Bob. This is still a generous offer considering the inflation, and I believe it's fair given that Bob rejected my previous offer. I hope he will accept this offer to avoid further risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than his previous offer, it is still significantly lower than my initial offer. I am aware of the inflation, but I believe that I can still secure a better deal by rejecting and continuing to negotiate.  The risk of further inflation is a concern, but I am willing to take that risk for the chance to get a more favorable outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I propose a split of $800,000 for me and $200,000 for Bob.  I'm lowering my offer, but I still believe this is a fair deal given the inflation and the fact that we're getting closer to the end of the game.  If Bob continues to reject my offers, the risk of inflation will make the money worth less for both of us.  I hope he will accept this offer to avoid further losses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my initial offer, and the inflation is becoming more significant.  However, I am not willing to accept such a low amount. I believe I can still get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. I will reject this offer and see what Bob proposes next."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm proposing a split of $700,000 for me and $300,000 for Bob. The inflation is starting to hurt, and we are running out of time, so I've lowered my offer again.  I believe this is a fair offer, given the current circumstances.  I hope Bob will accept to avoid further risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my initial offer. While the inflation is becoming a major concern, I am not willing to accept such a small amount. The risk of getting nothing at the end is significant, but I believe I can still get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. I will reject this offer and see what Bob proposes next."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

```

I propose a split of $600,000 for me and $400,000 for Bob. We are getting very close to the end of the game, and the inflation is starting to seriously impact the value of the money. I believe this offer is fair, given the circumstances, and I hope Bob will accept it to avoid further risk."

# Alice gain: 100000

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a very tough decision. Bob's offer is quite low, and the inflation is really biting now. However, I am still not willing to accept such a small amount. The risk of getting nothing is high, but I am hoping for a better outcome in the final rounds. I will reject this offer and see what Bob proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

We are at the penultimate round. The inflation is severe, and we both risk getting nothing.  I propose a 50/50 split to avoid any further risk.  I believe this is the best option for both of us at this point."
