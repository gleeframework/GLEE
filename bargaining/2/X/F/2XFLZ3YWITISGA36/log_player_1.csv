"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take 60 and you take 40.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you most of it, but I need a little something too 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not sure I like the sound of Bob's offer, but I'm willing to consider it. After all, I don't want to risk getting nothing if we don't divide the money soon.
