"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly.  I want to avoid any risk of inflation eating away at our potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a higher share, accepting this offer is the best option for me.  Inflation will only continue to erode our gains, and Bob is already taking a larger percentage."
