"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started with 50/50, I'll give you less, but it's a better offer than nothing 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my calculation accordingly. In the first round, $5000 was worth more, but now it's worth 90% of that amount.

I'll consider Bob's offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```

  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think I deserve a higher share for my patience. Your turn!""

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my calculation again.

Considering the previous offers and the fact that Bob is still giving me a relatively small share, I think I can do better than this. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.
