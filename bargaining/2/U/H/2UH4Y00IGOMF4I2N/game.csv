7000.0,3000.0,I propose we divide the money 7000 for me and 3000 for you. Consider it or let's see what the next round brings.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,I think a more balanced split is fairer. Let's go with 5500 for me and 4500 for you. This way we both get a good amount.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
6000.0,4000.0,"Considering the rejection, I adjust our proposal. I suggest dividing the money into 6000 for me and 4000 for you. This maintains a reasonable difference while still being fair.",Alice,3,
