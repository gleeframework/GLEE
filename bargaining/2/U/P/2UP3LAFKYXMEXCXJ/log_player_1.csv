"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000
}

This way, I get 90% of the initial $10,000, and Bob gets the remaining 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 5% less now, the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: $5000 / 0.95 = $5263.16
Bob gain: $5000 / 0.95 = $5263.16

I'll accept this offer.
