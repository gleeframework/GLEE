"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money fairly. I propose we divide it into two equal parts. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While a 50/50 split is fair in a traditional sense, it's not in my best interest with inflation in play. I want to maximize my potential gain, so I'll reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I understand the concept of fairness, but I believe this offer is more advantageous for both of us in the long run, considering the impact of inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, let's aim for an equal division to ensure both of our financial stability. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

With inflation, I'm losing money each round.  While I'd ideally get more, accepting a 50/50 split ensures I don't lose any more money to inflation and get a decent amount."
