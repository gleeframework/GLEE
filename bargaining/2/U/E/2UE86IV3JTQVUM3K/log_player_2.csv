Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're right, this is taking too long. I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bigger share. This is my final offer 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a tough one, but time is working against me. While I'd prefer a larger share, waiting any longer will only result in a worse outcome due to the inflation. Accepting this offer guarantees me something, whereas continuing to gamble could leave me with even less."
