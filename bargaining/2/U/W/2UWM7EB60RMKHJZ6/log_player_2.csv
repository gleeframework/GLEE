"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair. You get a small share now, but we can both get more in future rounds if we keep playing. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's message emphasizes potential future gains, the current offer is significantly unfavorable to Bob. It's better to reject and see if Alice offers a more balanced split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable. I'm offering you a fair share, and we can both avoid losing too much money with inflation.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but this offer is closer to what I think is fair. If we keep rejecting each other, we'll both lose more money to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though Alice's offer is still less favorable than my initial proposal, the risk of further inflation makes accepting this offer the better choice.  In the next round, my potential gain would be significantly lower due to the 19% inflation, while Alice's gain would be 36% lower.  Accepting this offer is the best way to minimize potential losses."
