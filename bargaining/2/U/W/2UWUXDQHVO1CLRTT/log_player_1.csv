"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount of money, and we can start the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair.  We can both get more if we play it smart. Accept this, and let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth 20% less, so the numbers are now:

Alice gain: 480,000
Bob gain: 720,000

I'm not convinced that a 60/40 split is fair, especially since I was willing to offer a 60/40 split in the first round. I'll try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, the money is worth 20% less again, so the numbers are now:

Alice gain: 384,000
Bob gain: 576,000

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think I deserve a bigger share for taking the risk of negotiation.""
}
