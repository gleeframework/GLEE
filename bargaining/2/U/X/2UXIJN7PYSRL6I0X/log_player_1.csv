"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $800,000 and Bob gets $200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I think you can do better than that! 
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think $700,000 is a good deal for me, especially considering that the money is worth less and less with each round. I'd like to try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, hoping that Bob will see it as a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to give up too much, but I'll meet you halfway. You can do better than this, though! 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth less and less each round, I need to think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think $550,000 is a good enough deal for me, considering the decreasing value of money. I'd like to try to get a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
 ""message"": ""Let's split it 50-50. It's the fairest way to end this.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping that Bob will see it as a reasonable and fair way to end the game."
