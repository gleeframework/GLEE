I propose to keep $9,000 and give Bob $1,000.  I'm aiming for a large share, but I want to make sure Bob has some incentive to accept in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer. Even though the money is worth less for Bob, he's still getting a much larger share than me. I'll try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
``` 

I'm offering Bob a larger share than in the first round, but still keeping a significant portion for myself.  I'm hoping this will be more appealing to him, as he's seen the value of his potential gains decrease."
