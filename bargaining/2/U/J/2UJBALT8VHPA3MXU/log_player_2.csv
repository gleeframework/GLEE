"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to reject this offer and see what Alice proposes in the next round.  There's a lot of money at stake, and I want to see if I can get a better deal.  Plus, the inflation factor means the longer we go, the more valuable my share will be."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}
``` 

I'm offering a 50/50 split. This is a fair and equitable proposal that I believe Alice will accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is better than her first offer, but I'm still not satisfied.  I'm going to see if I can get a better deal in the next round.  The inflation factor means that my share is worth more the longer we go, and I'm confident I can get a more favorable outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}
```

I'm going to increase my share slightly, offering a 55/45 split in my favor. This is still a fair offer, and I believe Alice will accept it considering she rejected a 50/50 split in the previous round.  The inflation factor is working in my favor, and I'm confident I can get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 460000 
# Alice gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation factor is starting to hurt Alice significantly. Her offer is approaching a 50/50 split, and with only 7 rounds remaining, it's risky to keep rejecting. Accepting this offer ensures I get a decent share and avoids the possibility of getting nothing at all."
