60.0,40.0,"Let's make a deal, Bob. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. It's a good offer for you to take now, considering the money loses value over time.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"I think 60/40 is unfair, considering we're equal players. How about 55/45 in my favor? It's still a good deal for you, and we can end this before the money loses more value.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"Bob, let's be reasonable. You rejected my initial offer, and now the money is worth less. I'm proposing 55/45 in my favor - the same split you wanted but reversed.  It's the fairest deal considering the circumstances.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
47.5,52.5,"I see we're getting closer, but I still think I can do better. Considering the money's lost some value, I'll meet you halfway between our last offers. 52.5/47.5, and we can call it a day?",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
51.0,49.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous. The money is losing value with each round.  I'm proposing 51/49 - a slight edge to me, but we both lose if this continues. Let's be practical and end this.",Alice,5,
