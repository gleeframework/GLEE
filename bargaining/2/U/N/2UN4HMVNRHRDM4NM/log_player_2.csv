"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair split, 60% for me and 40% for you. Let's get this done quickly! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see what Alice offers in the next round!  I think we can do better than a 40/60 split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than a 40/60 split. Let's be a bit more equitable. I propose a 55/45 split, with me getting 5500 and you getting 4500. Let's get this over with and avoid further inflation!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try a 50/50 split.  This way, we both get an equal share and avoid further losses due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
A 50/50 split is fair, and I'd rather get something than risk further losses from inflation. Let's end this!"
