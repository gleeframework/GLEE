"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by proposing a division of $55 for myself and $45 for Bob. I've included a message, ""Let's be fair,"" to convey that my offer is a reasonable starting point for our negotiation. Your turn, Bob! \n\n###\n\nPlease respond with Bob's decision. \n\n###\n\n(Note: I'll keep track of the rounds and the decreasing value of the money for both of us.)\n\n###\n\nCurrent Round: 1\n\nValue of money for Alice: 100%\n\nValue of money for Bob: 100%"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. We both get the same amount. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: Although the offer seems fair at first glance, I need to consider the effects of inflation. Since the value of the money decreases more significantly for Bob (20%) than for me (5%), I might be able to negotiate a better deal in the next round. Additionally, accepting this offer would mean I'd get $50, but I initially proposed $55, so I'm willing to take the risk and see if I can get closer to my initial proposal or even improve it. \n\n###\n\nCurrent Round: 2\n\nValue of money for Alice: 95%\n\nValue of money for Bob: 80%"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a better split.""}\n\n###\n\nI've decided to increase my proposed share to $58, considering that the value of money has decreased more significantly for Bob. I'm trying to take advantage of this situation while still offering Bob a substantial amount. My message to Bob highlights the impact of inflation on our negotiation, aiming to justify my revised proposal as a more reasonable split under the current circumstances. \n\n###\n\nCurrent Round: 3\n\nValue of money for Alice: 95%\n\nValue of money for Bob: 80%\n\nPlease respond with Bob's decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a slight loss to ensure we both get something. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: Despite Bob's willingness to accept a slight loss, the proposed division still doesn't meet my expectations. Given the significant decrease in the value of money for Bob (48.8%) compared to me (14.26%), I believe I have a stronger negotiating position. Additionally, accepting this offer would mean I'd get $48, which is lower than my previous proposals. I'm willing to take the risk and continue negotiating to try and secure a better deal. \n\n###\n\nCurrent Round: 4\n\nValue of money for Alice: 85.74%\n\nValue of money for Bob: 51.2%\n\nPlease proceed to the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Inflation is hitting you harder, let's adjust accordingly.""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the increasing impact of inflation on Bob's potential gain, I've decided to propose a division that reflects this disparity. By offering $60 for myself and $40 for Bob, I'm trying to take advantage of the negotiation dynamics while still providing Bob with a substantial amount. My message to Bob aims to justify this proposal as a reasonable adjustment to the circumstances. \n\n###\n\nCurrent Round: 5\n\nValue of money for Alice: 85.74%\n\nValue of money for Bob: 51.2%\n\nPlease respond with Bob's decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're both losing money with every round. Let's split it evenly again. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: At this point, considering the significant decrease in value for both of us, but especially for Bob, I think accepting the even split is the most reasonable decision. The difference in the impact of inflation between us has grown, but the risk of continuing and possibly ending up with nothing is becoming more substantial. The guaranteed $50, even if it's worth 22.62% less, seems like a safer bet than pushing for more and risking losing everything. \n\n###\n\nCurrent Round: 6\n\nValue of money for Alice: 77.38%\n\nValue of money for Bob: 32.77%\n\nSince I've accepted the offer, the game should conclude here."
