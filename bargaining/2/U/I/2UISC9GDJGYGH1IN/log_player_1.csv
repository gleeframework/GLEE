Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

This offer is a fair starting point, giving Bob a slight advantage. I'm hoping he'll accept it in the first round to avoid the risk of inflation."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 35, ""bob_gain"": 65}
```

I'm proposing a 35/65 split in favor of Bob. With only 3 rounds left, I'm starting to feel the pressure of inflation.  I'm hoping that this offer is enough to convince Bob to accept and end the game, as it still gives him a significant advantage."

Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 30, ""bob_gain"": 70}
```

I'm proposing a 30/70 split, recognizing the significant inflation I've faced. This is a risky move, as time is running out.  However, with only two rounds left, I'm hoping Bob will see that the risk of going to the final round outweighs the potential gains from a slightly better offer."
