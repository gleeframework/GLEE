"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and start fresh!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving us both $500,000 each."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 400000, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with this offer. I was hoping for a more even split, and giving me only $400,000 while Bob takes $600,000 is not acceptable. I'll reject this offer and hope to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I still think I deserve a bit more""}

I'm proposing a 45/55 split, giving Bob a slightly larger share than before, but still keeping a bit more for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 300000, but I think I'm being generous 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with this offer at all. The inflation has taken a significant toll on the value of the money, and Bob is still trying to take a huge chunk of it for himself. Giving me only $300,000 while he takes $700,000 is unacceptable. I'll reject this offer and hope to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 320000, ""bob_gain"": 680000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give away too much""}

I'm proposing a 32/68 split, giving Bob a slightly larger share than before, but still keeping a significant amount for myself. I'm trying to be more generous, but I'm not willing to give away too much."
