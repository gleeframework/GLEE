"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can do better than that! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 10% less, I'll need to consider the relative value of the offer.

In this round, I'd be getting $400,000, which is worth the same as $450,000 in the first round. Meanwhile, Bob would be getting $600,000, which is worth $660,000 in the first round.

This offer seems a bit more skewed towards Bob's favor, but I'll have to consider whether it's worth accepting.

For now, I'll reject the offer and see what Bob comes up with next.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer in round 2 was a bit more skewed towards his favor, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer in round 3.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""You can do better than that! ""
}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a bit more favorable to me. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I can see that! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of the fact that the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, while his gain is worth significantly less due to inflation.

In this round, I'd be getting $300,000, which is worth the same as $450,000 in the first round. Meanwhile, Bob would be getting $700,000, which is worth $660,000 in the first round.

This offer is even more skewed towards Bob's favor, and I'm starting to feel the pressure of the time constraint. However, I'll try to hold out for a better deal.

For now, I'll reject the offer and see what Bob comes up with next.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Time's running out, Bob! Don't make me regret this!""

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting greedy, Alice!

# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of my supposed greed and make a very lopsided offer.

In this round, I'd be getting $200,000, which is worth the same as $450,000 in the first round. Meanwhile, Bob would be getting $800,000, which is worth $600,000 in the first round.

# Bob's message: You're really trying to starve me, aren't you?

Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is getting desperate and trying to get as little as possible, but I'm not going to let him get away with it.

In this round, I'd be getting $10,000, which is worth the same as $45,000 in the first round. Meanwhile, Bob would be getting $990,000, which is worth $300,000 in the first round.

This offer is absolutely unacceptable to me. I'd be giving up 99% of the original amount, which is not worth it. I'll reject this offer and see what Bob comes up with next.
