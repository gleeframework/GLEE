"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair deal. I'll take the lion's share, but you get a decent amount.  We can negotiate later. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
 
While this offer is ""fair"" in the sense of giving Bob something, it's not a good starting point.  It's important to establish a stronger negotiating position, and rejecting this offer allows Bob to make the next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is a good starting point.  It's fair, and we can both benefit from getting this deal done quickly.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but 55/45 is still too much in your favor. Let's try 60/40. This is a fair deal for both of us, and we can avoid further losses due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

While 60/40 is a better deal for Bob than the previous offer, it's still a substantial loss compared to the 55/45 split Bob initially proposed.  Rejecting this offer allows Bob to counter with a more favorable proposition in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable. A 50/50 split is the fairest way to divide the money, especially with inflation eroding our gains. It's time to be pragmatic and avoid further losses.""}
