"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

This way, I get 70% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob gets 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this new offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll have to calculate the actual value of the offer in terms of the initial $1,000,000.

Alice gain: 300,000 / 0.9 = 333,333.33 (in terms of initial $1,000,000)
Bob gain: 700,000 / 0.95 = 736.8421 (in terms of initial $1,000,000)

Considering the offer, I'll decide to reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Now it's my turn to make a new offer. Considering the inflation, I'll aim to get a slightly higher percentage than before.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob gets 40%."
