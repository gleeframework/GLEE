"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but it's a fair start, and I'm hoping he'll accept and we can split the money quickly."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: It's my turn now. This offer is more fair. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a bigger share!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, I'll have to adjust my decision accordingly.

I'll reject this offer and wait for the next round.

```

  ""bob_gain"": 160000,
  ""message"": ""Let's make a deal, Bob! Don't let inflation eat into our profits!""

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise. This is a fair deal, considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to make a deal, but he's still trying to get the better end of the stick!

Considering the inflation, my gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, so I'll have to take that into account. However, I still think this offer is a bit too generous for Bob.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 720000,
  ""bob_gain"": 280000,

# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to stick to his guns and get a larger share, but I think he's starting to realize the importance of making a deal before the money loses too much value.

Considering the inflation, my gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round, so I'll have to think carefully about this offer. However, I think 25% is a bit too low for me, considering the risks we've taken so far.
