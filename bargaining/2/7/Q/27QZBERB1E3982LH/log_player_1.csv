"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This way, I get the majority of the money, but still leave Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob, the effective amounts are:

My gain: 1000 / 0.8 = 1250
Bob's gain: 9000 / 0.9 = 10000

I'm not happy with this offer, as it's even more skewed towards Bob than the previous one. I'll reject it.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

This offer is more balanced, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the effective amounts:

My gain: 4500 / 0.5248 = 8581.5 (round down to 8581)
Bob's gain: 5500 / 0.7279 = 7551.5 (round down to 7551)

This offer is actually very close to the original 50/50 split, but with the effects of inflation. I'll accept it.
