"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll analyze the offer:

Alice gain: 100,000
Bob gain: 900,000

Considering the inflation effect, the actual value of the money is decreasing, so I should aim to maximize the value of my share. In this case, I'll accept the offer.
