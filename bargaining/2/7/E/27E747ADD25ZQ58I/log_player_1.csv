"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leave $4,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","In Round 2, the money is worth less for both of us, so I'll have to adjust my strategy. Since Bob's offer is the same as the one I made in Round 1, but with the money being worth less, I'll reject it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In Round 3, the money is worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob compared to Round 2. Here's my new offer:

I'm offering to take $4,500 and leave $5,500 for Bob."
