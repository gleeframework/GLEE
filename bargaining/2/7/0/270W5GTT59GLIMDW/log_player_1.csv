"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can negotiate from here""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, let's meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a toll!

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to get a bit more, meet me at 55-45""
}
```

I'm not quite ready to meet in the middle just yet. I'd like to push for a slightly better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is getting worse!

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for inflation""
}
```

I'm trying to adjust for the 10% loss in value due to inflation, so I'm offering a 55-45 split. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give away too much 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a bite out of my potential earnings!

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Thanks for the extra 200, I'll take it""
}
```

I think this offer is reasonable, and I'm willing to accept it. I'll take the 5200 and call it a day."
