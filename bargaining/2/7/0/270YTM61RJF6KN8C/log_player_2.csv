Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bigger share to make up for the inflation. Let's split it 60/40. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice's offer is getting better, but it's still heavily skewed in her favor considering the rapid inflation she faces.  I need to hold out for a better deal."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we need to meet in the middle. I'm willing to go down to 5500, but I need a better deal than your last offer. Time is running out for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is the best I'm likely to get. Alice has shown she's willing to negotiate, but the inflation is working heavily against her.  Accepting now guarantees a reasonable share, whereas holding out carries a significant risk of getting nothing at all."
