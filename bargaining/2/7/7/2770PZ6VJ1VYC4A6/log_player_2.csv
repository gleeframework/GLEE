"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer leaves us both with a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI think I can get a better deal than this! The 4000 dollars I'd get is a significant amount less than half of the total, and I think I can negotiate for more. Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's try to meet in the middle, Alice. This offer is closer to a fair split, considering the next rounds will reduce the value of the money.""}\n\n###\n\nSince the money's value decreases by 10% for me and 5% for Alice each round, I want to try to settle on a deal sooner rather than later. Offering Alice a bit less than half seems reasonable, given the decreasing value of the money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the pressure of inflation, Bob. This offer ensures we both benefit, even with the decreasing value. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlthough the pressure of inflation is mounting, Alice's new offer doesn't significantly improve my gain from the first round, considering the devaluation of money. Given that we're both losing value each round, I believe there's still room to negotiate for a more favorable split. Let's proceed and see if we can find a better compromise."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Considering the significant impact of inflation on my end, I'm willing to adjust my offer slightly, but I still believe a closer split is necessary given the circumstances. This is likely the most I can compromise before the value drops too low.""}\n\n###\n\nGiven that the money's value continues to decrease, I'm trying to find a balance that acknowledges Alice's smaller loss due to inflation while also considering my own larger loss. By slightly adjusting my previous offer, I'm hoping we can find a mutually acceptable compromise before the value drops too low."
