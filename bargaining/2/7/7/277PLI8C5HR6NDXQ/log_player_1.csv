"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 400k, and I'll take the rest.""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount to start with, and we can see how the game plays out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I think this is a reasonable compromise. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I need to adjust my expectations accordingly.

I'll reject this offer since I'm getting a smaller share than in the previous round, and the money is worth less now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and the fact that Bob's offer was not satisfactory, I'll make a new offer with a slightly different ratio.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think this is still a fair split. What do you think?""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to get a larger share, but I'm not sure if it's a good deal for me.

Considering the inflation, the money I'd get in this offer is actually worth less than in the previous round, and I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject this offer.
