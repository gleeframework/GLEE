"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money with a 70-30 split in favor of Alice. This seems fair considering the risk of inflation.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This is a fair compromise, and since I'm making the offer now, I'm taking into account the inflation that will affect you more heavily than me in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
