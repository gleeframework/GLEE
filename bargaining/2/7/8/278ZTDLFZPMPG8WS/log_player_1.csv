"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you a third.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $30, which is a third of the original $100. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can finish the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than that. I'll give you 40, but you'll need to accept now before the money gets any less valuable. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I need to be more cautious. Bob's offer of $40 is a significant improvement from my previous offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer for now and see if I can do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll aim for a slightly higher percentage. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll compromise at 45% for me. It's a fair split, considering the inflation.""
}
```"
