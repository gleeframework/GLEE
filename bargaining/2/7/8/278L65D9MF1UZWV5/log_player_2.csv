**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to a more even split, it's important to hold firm a little longer. Accepting now would still give Alice a significant advantage, especially considering the increasing effects of inflation. We're nearing the halfway point, and Alice will likely become more willing to negotiate a fairer deal as the risk of losing everything increases."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 510000, ""alice_gain"": 490000, ""message"": ""Time is running out! This is a small advantage for me, but it ensures we both benefit.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  This offer is a slight concession from my previous offer, showing Alice I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Time Pressure:** With each round, the stakes get higher due to inflation. This offer emphasizes the need for a deal *now*.
* **Slight Edge:** While not a perfect split, getting slightly more than Alice gives me a small edge, reflecting my earlier negotiation position.  

This offer balances firmness with a willingness to compromise, making it likely to be more appealing to Alice as the game intensifies."
