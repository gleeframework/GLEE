Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be real. The inflation is killing us.  A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both walk away with something. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI think it's time to accept the offer. The inflation is indeed taking a significant toll on the value of the money, and a 50/50 split seems like a fair deal at this point. I don't want to risk losing everything by pushing for more, so I'll take the safe route and accept Alice's offer. It's better to get something than nothing!"
