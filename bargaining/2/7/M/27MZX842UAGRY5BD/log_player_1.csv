"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going for a very aggressive first offer.  I want to secure a large chunk of the money early on, as the value of the money will be significantly lower for me in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still very generous, but I believe I can still get a better deal for myself. I'm willing to wait a few more rounds to see if I can secure a larger share of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly to 85 for myself and 15 for Bob.  While Bob's offer was tempting, I'm still confident that I can get a better deal for myself if I remain patient and continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is becoming more reasonable as the value of the money decreases for both of us, I'm still hopeful that I can secure a larger share. I'm willing to risk it for a few more rounds to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm going to offer a slight compromise this time. I'm decreasing my own share by 5%, but still offering a larger portion to myself.  I hope that Bob will be more inclined to accept this offer as the value of the money decreases."
