"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a decent amount to start with""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this split is more fair. Let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my $8,000 from the first round is now worth 80% of its original value, so it's now worth $6,400. Bob's $2,000 is now worth 95% of its original value, so it's now worth $1,900.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting this offer because I think I can do better than a 3:5 split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, my $6,400 from the second round is now worth 80% of its original value, so it's now worth $5,120. 

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,500 and keeping $5,500 for myself."
