"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split, which seems fair to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of 4000 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, which is $4750, and Bob's gain of 6000 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, which is $4000.

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, considering the inflation adjustment. I think I'll reject this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation adjustments, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

I'm offering a slightly more favorable split for myself, but still a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation adjustments:

My gain of 3500 is worth 86.36% of what it was in the first round, which is approximately $8636. My gain in this round is actually worth more than what I initially proposed in Round 1!

Bob's gain of 6500 is worth 52% of what it was in the first round, which is $5200.

Considering this, I think I'll accept Bob's offer.
