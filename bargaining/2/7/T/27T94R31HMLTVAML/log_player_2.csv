"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 99% and leave you 1%. We can work out a more even split in the future if you like. 
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's a bad deal to accept 1% when I can potentially get more in the next round!"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better share than that. Let's split it 95/5 this round.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial outcome if we keep talking. 
# Bob gain: 50000 
# Alice gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm still hoping to get a larger share! I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
