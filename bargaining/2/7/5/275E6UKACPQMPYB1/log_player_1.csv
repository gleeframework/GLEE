Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7500 
# Bob gain: 2500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:** While my gains are worth less, Bob's gains are worth even less due to the higher inflation rate on his side. 
* **Better Offer:** This offer is significantly better for me than the previous round, as I'm receiving $7,500 compared to the $9,000 that was worth less in the previous round. 
* **Risk:**  Rejecting this offer means going through more rounds, where inflation will further erode the value of the money. It's safer to accept this offer and secure a good portion of the money."
