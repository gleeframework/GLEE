Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we need to find a compromise. This offer reflects the time pressure we both feel. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is hitting Bob hard. While accepting $4,000 is better than nothing, it's a significantly reduced amount due to the repeated rejections.  Bob needs to push for a better share while it's still worthwhile, hoping Alice will agree before the money value diminishes further."
