700000.0,300000.0,I propose dividing the money with a 70-30 split in favor of Alice. This seems fair considering the potential risk of inflation.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
200000.0,800000.0,"I think 80-20 is a more reasonable split, considering the risk of inflation is still uncertain.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
600000.0,400000.0,"Considering the inflation risk, I suggest a 60-40 split. This maintains a balance between our shares while accounting for potential future value loss.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
100000.0,900000.0,"I think it's time to take a risk and go for a more extreme split, considering the inflation is eating away at our potential gains. 90-10 seems like a fair compromise.",Bob,4,
