"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $4,000, and I'll take $6,000. What do you think?""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be careful with the inflation!

Since the money is worth 10% less now, I'll have to adjust my calculation accordingly. In the first round, $6,000 was worth $6,000. Now, with 10% inflation, $6,000 is worth $5,400. But Bob's offer is $4,000, which is worth $4,000, the same as in the first round.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer...

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 10% less again, I'll have to adjust my offer accordingly.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more this time. Take $5,500, and I'll take $4,500. What do you think?""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle this time. 50/50 split. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my calculation accordingly. In the first round, $5,000 was worth $5,000. Now, with 27.1% inflation, $5,000 is worth $3,636.90.

A 50/50 split is a good idea, but I'd rather take a bit more, considering the inflation.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the 27.1% inflation.

Since the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'll aim for a higher percentage of the remaining value. In the first round, $5,000 was worth $5,000. Now, with 27.1% inflation, $5,000 is worth $3,636.90. I'll aim for a higher percentage of this value.
