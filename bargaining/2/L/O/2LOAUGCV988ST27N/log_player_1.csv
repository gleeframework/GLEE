"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise with a 3:2 ratio. This way, we both get a decent share of the money, considering the decreasing value. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
