"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose Alice gets $9,000 and Bob gets $1,000. It's a good starting point to see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8500, ""bob_gain"": 1500}
``` 

I'm going to lower my share slightly to 8500, but still offer Bob a relatively small increase. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not going to give away the majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm going to lower my share again, but I'm starting to see a pattern in Bob's offers. He seems to be increasing his share by 500 each round. I'm hoping this offer will make him reconsider and come closer to a more balanced split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000

{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
The inflation is hitting hard now, and Bob's offer isn't changing much. I'm sticking to my strategy of trying to negotiate a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7500, ""bob_gain"": 2500}
```

I'm continuing to lower my share, but I'm also starting to get a little desperate. With the inflation, the value of my share is decreasing rapidly. I need to find a way to get Bob to accept an offer before I lose too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is not budging, and the inflation is really hurting me. I'm still holding out hope that he'll come to a more balanced offer, but I'm starting to feel the pressure."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm making one last push to get a reasonable offer through.  I'm reducing my share again, hoping to get Bob to see that it's in his best interest to accept a deal before we both end up with nothing. The inflation is making each round riskier, and I'm running out of time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still going to reject Bob's offer. Even though the inflation is hurting me significantly,  I believe there's still a chance I can get a better deal. I'm hoping Bob will realize that we are both losing value with each passing round and will be more open to negotiation in the final rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500}
```

It's getting very risky now.  I'm lowering my share one last time, but I'm also hoping Bob is starting to feel the pressure of the inflation.  If he's smart, he'll realize that we're both losing more money with each passing round, and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 43.12% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is the final round, and I can't afford to risk getting nothing.  Although this offer is far from what I initially hoped for, it's better than nothing. The inflation has taken a huge toll, and I need to accept this deal to secure at least some of the money."
