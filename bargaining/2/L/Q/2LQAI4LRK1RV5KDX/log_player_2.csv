"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer ensures we both benefit. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer.  While it's a decent starting point,  I can potentially get a better deal by seeing what Alice is willing to offer in the next round. The risk of inflation is present, but I'm willing to gamble for a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I'm feeling generous, Alice.  This offer is a bit closer to what I'd like, but we can still work something out.  Let's be reasonable.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out and inflation is eating our money!  This is my final offer above 50%. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

The inflation is starting to become a real threat, and Alice's offer is close to what I was aiming for. While I might be able to do better in the next round, the risk of getting nothing is too high. I'll accept the offer and secure some of the money."
