"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I get the majority of the money, but still give Bob a significant share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain is worth even less. I'll have to think carefully...

I'll reject this offer. I'd rather wait for a better deal.

```

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In the third round, my potential gain is worth 20% less than in the second round. I'll make a new offer:

  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}
