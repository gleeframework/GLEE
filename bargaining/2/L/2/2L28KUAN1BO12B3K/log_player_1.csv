"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a decent share, let's settle now!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000, which is a relatively generous share considering the total amount. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure about 2:1, but I'll give you a better deal 
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll decide to reject it. I'd rather wait for a better deal, especially since the money is worth less with each passing round. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is taking a toll on my potential gain. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting a better deal by waiting, let's finalize now!""
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive in this round, hoping that Bob will accept and we can end the game before the money loses even more value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting more generous, but I'll try to squeeze a bit more 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really eating into my potential gain now. Considering Bob's new offer, I'll decide to reject it. I'm still hoping to get a better deal, especially since the money is worth less and less with each passing round. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really taking its toll now. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
 ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, it's the fairest deal at this point""
}
```

I'm trying to be more realistic and consider the fact that the money is worth significantly less now. Splitting it 50/50 seems like a reasonable compromise, but I'm still open to negotiations."
