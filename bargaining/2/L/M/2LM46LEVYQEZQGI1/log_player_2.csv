**Reasoning:** While the deal is getting closer to even, time is on my side. Alice's losses are outpacing mine due to the inflation rates.  I can hold out for a bit longer and see if I can get a slightly better deal."

**Reasoning:**  The deal is now very close to even and the inflation is starting to become a significant factor. Accepting this offer guarantees a reasonable payout, whereas continuing to hold out carries a serious risk of getting nothing if we don't reach an agreement in the next 5 rounds."
