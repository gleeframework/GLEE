"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 4000, ""bob_gain"": 6000}

I'm offering Bob 60% of the total amount, which is a relatively fair split. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less now, the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: 5000 * 0.95 = 4750
Bob gain: 5000 * 0.95 = 4750

I'll accept this offer. 

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
