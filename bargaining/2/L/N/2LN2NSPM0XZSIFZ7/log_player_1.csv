Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose a 95/5 split in my favor. I want to secure most of the money now since the inflation will hurt Bob more than it hurts me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm still going to try for a higher share, but I'm going to lower my proposal to 80/20. This is a compromise, but I need to ensure I get a decent amount of money before the inflation hits too hard."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a tough choice, as the inflation has really hurt Bob. But I'm not sure I'll get a better offer, and accepting gives me a decent amount."
