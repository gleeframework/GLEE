"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair deal.  I'll take 90% and you get 10%. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible deal for Bob!  We need to negotiate a much fairer split."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5250,
""alice_gain"": 4750,
""message"": ""That's not how we start a fair negotiation Alice. I propose a 52.5/47.5 split in my favor.  Take it or leave it - the pot gets smaller from here.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, I understand you want a larger share.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on the 50/50 split. This offer gives you a decent gain while still ensuring I get a fair return.  Let's avoid further losses from inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is trying to take advantage of the shrinking pot! We can still get a better deal than this."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5125,
""alice_gain"": 4875,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. I'm offering you a 48.75/51.25 split.  This is my final offer, accept it before inflation eats away at our potential gains.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're both losing money with every round. Let's end this now with a simple 50/50 split.  It's the fairest option, and we can both walk away with a decent share. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

It's time to be pragmatic. Alice won't likely go higher, and we're losing substantial money with each round due to inflation. A 50/50 split is fair and ensures we both get something."
