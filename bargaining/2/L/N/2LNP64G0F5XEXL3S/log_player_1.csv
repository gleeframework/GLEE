I'm going for a big chunk of the money, but leaving a little for Bob to hopefully encourage him to accept.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. Even though the money is worth less, I believe I can get a better deal. It's Bob's turn to make a more reasonable offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to try to get closer to a 70/30 split, as I think that's a fair starting point given the current state of the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is getting greedy. Even with inflation, I think I can still get a better deal. I'll reject this and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to try and meet Bob halfway. I'm willing to give up a little more, but not too much. This offer is a fair compromise, and I hope Bob will see it that way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still trying to squeeze more out of me, but I'm not giving up yet.  I'll reject this and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

We're getting close to the end, and the value of the money is dropping significantly. It's time for a compromise.  Let's split it evenly and call it a day."
