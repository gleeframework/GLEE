"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my opening offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to start, hoping to set a fair tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more aggressive in my counteroffer to account for the inflation. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a higher share for myself. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm trying to take advantage of the situation, hoping Bob will accept a slightly more favorable split."
