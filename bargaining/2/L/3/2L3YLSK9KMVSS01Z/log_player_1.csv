"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, and we can re-evaluate in the next round""
}
```

I'm starting with a fair split, hoping to set a good tone for the negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll try to get more 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, the money I gain is worth 95% of its original value, and Bob's gain is worth 80% of its original value.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can get a better deal. I'll try to negotiate further to get a higher share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much. Let's see if you'll meet me in the middle""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still holding firm on getting a bit more than half."
