"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, and we can adjust in future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's tempting to take a fair split, but the inflation element makes it risky to accept early. Let's see if Alice will offer more in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I think it's fair to take a bit more as the one making the offer.  Let's see if this works for you.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're taking a bigger share, so I'll take a smaller share to keep the game going. 
# Bob gain: 5800 
# Alice gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice is getting more reasonable, and the money I'm getting is still the same, so I'll take it."
