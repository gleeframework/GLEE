"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can adjust in future rounds.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. I'm starting with a fair split, but I'm not giving away too much in case the inflation effect on Bob is more severe than I expect."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair to take a bit more as the one making the offer.  Let's see if this works for you. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 5% inflation, the money I gain is now worth less, so I need to be more cautious.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""You're taking a bigger share, so I'll take a smaller share to keep the game going.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob an even bigger share, but I'm still trying to keep some buffer in case the inflation effect on Bob is more severe than I expect."
