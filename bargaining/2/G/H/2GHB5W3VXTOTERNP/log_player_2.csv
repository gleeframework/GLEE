"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll get a bit more 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""My turn! I understand you want a larger share, but my offer in this round is better than what you'll get in the next if you reject.""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Value of Money:**  Due to inflation, the value of the $100 shrinks each round. It's in both players' best interests to settle sooner rather than later.
* **Exploiting Inflation Asymmetry:**  The inflation rate is higher for Bob (20%) than for Alice (5%). This means each round hurts Bob more than Alice.  Bob needs to leverage this to push for a better deal now.
* **Strategic Bargaining:** Offering Alice slightly less than what she wanted in round 1 (60) but more than what she'd get in round 3 (if she rejects in round 2) creates a sense of urgency and might entice her to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You tried to lowball, now it's my turn again 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Impact:** The money has significantly devalued for Bob. Accepting $42 now is better than risking another round and getting an even lower offer.
* **Alice's Position:** Alice is unlikely to offer more than $42 in subsequent rounds. She knows Bob is feeling the pressure of inflation and is in a strong bargaining position.
* **Avoiding Further Losses:** Delaying only hurts Bob more. It's better to take the current offer and avoid the risk of getting even less in the future."
