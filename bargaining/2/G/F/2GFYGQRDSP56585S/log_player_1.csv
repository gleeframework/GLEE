"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, where we each get $50."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not too concerned about the value of my share. However, I'm not thrilled about giving Bob a bigger share, especially since he's trying to take advantage of the inflation.

I'll decide to reject this offer and hope to do better in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer was 40-60, I'll try to adjust my offer to get a better deal. I'll propose a 55-45 split, which is closer to a 50-50 split than Bob's previous offer.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob's offer is getting more aggressive! Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'm not too concerned about the value of my share. However, I'm getting worried about the value of my share decreasing due to inflation.

I'll think carefully about this offer. If I accept, I'll get a smaller share, but I'll also avoid the risk of getting an even smaller share in future rounds. On the other hand, if I reject, I might get a better offer in the next round.

After some thought, I'll decide to accept Bob's offer.
