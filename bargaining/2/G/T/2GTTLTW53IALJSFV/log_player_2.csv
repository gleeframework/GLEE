"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take the bigger share, but I'll leave you with something. Hopefully, you'll accept and we can both walk away with some cash. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While it's tempting to take $1,000, it's a very small share and there are 12 rounds left.  The inflation will significantly reduce the value of the money in the later rounds. It's worth trying to negotiate a better deal."
