Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since I rejected the 50/50 split, I'll try to get more. Given the 10% inflation, I'll aim for a larger share. Here's my offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 6000 
# Alice gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, Alice's offer seems reasonable. I'll accept it this time.
