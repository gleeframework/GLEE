Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 900,000/100,000 split. I believe this is a fair offer, as it gives Bob a decent share while still ensuring a significant portion for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
