I propose to take 9000 dollars for myself and give 1000 dollars to Bob. This is a fair deal, considering I am the one who is losing money with each passing round due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}

I propose to take 7000 dollars for myself and give 3000 dollars to Bob.  I'm willing to compromise a bit more than my last offer, but I still need to account for the inflation I'm facing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm still losing too much money due to inflation.  I need to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm willing to give Bob a bit more this time.  I'm losing a significant amount to inflation, but I'm hoping this offer will be enough to reach a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

While I'm losing a large percentage of my potential earnings due to inflation, I'm unlikely to get a better offer. This deal is the closest to a fair split, considering the inflation factor."
