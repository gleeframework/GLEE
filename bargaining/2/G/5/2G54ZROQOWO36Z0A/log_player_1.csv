"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split, but I'm hoping Bob will be willing to negotiate and give me a slightly better deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not giving away too much 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $4000 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, so it's actually $3200 in real value.

I'm not thrilled with this offer, but it's a bit better than the 50/50 split. I'll think carefully...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 80% of its original value after two rounds, and I'm hoping to make a better deal, I'll try to get a bit more.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not giving away too much. Your turn again!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not giving away too much. You're getting closer to my target 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $3500 is worth 41.6% of what it was in the first round, so it's actually $4160 in real value.

I'm getting closer to my target, but I'm not quite there yet. I'll think carefully...
