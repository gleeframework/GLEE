6000.0,4000.0,I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering the inflation rate. Let's not waste time with further rounds.,Alice,1,

5200.0,4800.0,"Bob, let's be reasonable. I understand your position, but my previous offer was already generous. This is 52/48 in my favor -  it minimizes our losses from inflation.  Accepting this now is the smartest move for both of us.",Alice,3,
