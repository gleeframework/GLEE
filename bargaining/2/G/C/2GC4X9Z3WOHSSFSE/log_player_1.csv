"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, I'll give you a chance to negotiate""
}
```

This offer gives me 80% of the initial $10,000, and Bob gets 20%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this generous offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if he declines!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, let's split it 6:4, aiming for a fairer distribution. 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I'd rather not accept this offer. I'd like to propose a counteroffer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Your offer is still too skewed, I'll make a counteroffer: 5:5 split""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will reconsider and meet me in the middle!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is taking its toll! Due to the 20% decrease in value, the money is now worth 80% of its original value. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, it's only fair""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will see reason and accept this more even split!"
