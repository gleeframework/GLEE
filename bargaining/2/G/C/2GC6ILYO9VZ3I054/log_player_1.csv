"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Accept and we can split the cash, or I'll make a better offer next round.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself. The message is a gentle nudge to see if he'll accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm offering a fairer split.  Let's be reasonable, or we both risk losing more in the next rounds. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Considering the inflation, the $400,000 I'd gain in this round is worth 80% of the $700,000 I could have gained in the first round, which is a significant reduction. However, I also don't want to risk losing even more in the next rounds.

I'll play it safe and accept Bob's offer.
