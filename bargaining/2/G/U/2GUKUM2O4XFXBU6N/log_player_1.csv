"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to get it over with!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to get the game started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll think carefully... With inflation, my gain of $40 is worth only 95% of its original value, so it's equivalent to $38 in the first round. I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, considering Bob is getting 60% of the original $100, which is a significant amount.

I'll reject this offer for now.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was for 60% and I rejected it, I'll try to be more aggressive in my counteroffer. I'll aim for a higher percentage for myself.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 65,
  ""bob_gain"": 35,
  ""message"": ""You wanted more, but I'm not giving you all the power!""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not giving up yet! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is biting!

Let me calculate the actual value of my gain in this round... My gain of $45 is worth 85.74% of its original value, which is equivalent to $38.53 in the first round. Not bad, but I was hoping for more.

Considering Bob is getting 55% of the original $100, which is still a significant amount, I'll think carefully... I'm not sure if I should accept this offer.

I'll reject this offer for now.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to be more aggressive again, considering the inflation is eating away at my potential gains.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Time's running out, Bob! I'm taking control!""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will blink first!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up yet, Alice! I'll give you a better deal 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains! My gain of $35 is worth 77.38% of its original value, which is equivalent to $30.38 in the first round.

Considering Bob is getting 65% of the original $100, which is a significant amount, I'm not sure if I should accept this offer.

However, I'm running out of time, and I don't want to end up with nothing. I'll think carefully... I'll accept this offer.
