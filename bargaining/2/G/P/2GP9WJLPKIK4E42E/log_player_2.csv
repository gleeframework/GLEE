{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Your offer was kind, Alice, but doesn't account for the inflation. Let's split 55-45, it's fairer considering the money will be worth less next round.""}

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see your point about inflation, but I think 55-45 is too much in your favor. How about we compromise at 58-42? 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58
