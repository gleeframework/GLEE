Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive offer, but I'm leaving Bob a small share to incentivize him to accept in the first round.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, it's in my best interest to accept this offer.  Waiting another round means I'll get less due to inflation, and Bob's offer is still reasonable."
