# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, $70 is still a decent offer. However, I was hoping for a bit more considering the initial proposal.

I'll decide to...

Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the money Bob gains is worth a lot less now!

Considering the significant decrease in value, I'm willing to accept a smaller share. $80 is a decent offer, and I'm not sure I can do better.

I'll decide to...
