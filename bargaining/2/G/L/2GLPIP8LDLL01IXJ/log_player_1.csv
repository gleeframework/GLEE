"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40. I'll take the smaller share if you accept.""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob a relatively smaller share, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take this or leave it, I'm not going for 40% 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gain, I need to be more cautious. Bob's offer is quite aggressive, but I think I can do better than 30%. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain is now worth 36% less than the original amount. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time, hoping Bob will accept.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, I'm not going for 70%!""
}
```"
