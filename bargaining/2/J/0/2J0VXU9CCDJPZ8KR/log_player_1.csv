"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""
}
```

I'm offering to take $60 and give Bob $40, with a message that suggests this is a relatively fair split. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's only fair to split it down the middle since we are both players in this game 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer:


{
  ""alice_gain"": 65,
  ""bob_gain"": 35,
  ""message"": ""You had your chance, now it's my turn to be a bit greedy""
}


Since Bob's money is worth less due to inflation, I'm willing to take a bit more this time around. Let's see how Bob responds!"
