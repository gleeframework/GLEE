"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 

This is a fairly aggressive offer, but it allows me to secure most of the money in the first round. Since the value of the money depreciates for Bob, I'm hoping he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While this offer is more balanced, it still doesn't account for the depreciation in the value of money for Bob.  I believe I can still secure a more advantageous deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

This offer is a compromise. I am willing to give up a bit of my initial gain, but I believe this is a fair offer considering the depreciation of money for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is becoming more appealing, but I'm still not satisfied. The depreciation in his money is significant now, and I believe I can still get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm sticking with a relatively high offer for myself, but I'm acknowledging the significant depreciation in Bob's money. Hopefully this time he will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is becoming increasingly attractive due to the significant depreciation in his money. While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer guarantees me a decent portion of the money before it depreciates further."
