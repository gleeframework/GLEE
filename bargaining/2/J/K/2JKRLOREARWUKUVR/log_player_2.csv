Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 425000 
# Alice gain: 575000

```

At this point, accepting is the most logical choice, even though it's not an optimal outcome. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Every round, Bob's potential gains decrease significantly due to inflation. Waiting any longer will only result in a worse deal for him. 
* **Alice's Stubbornness:** Alice has consistently offered deals favoring her. It's unlikely she will drastically change her approach in future rounds. 
* **Something is Better Than Nothing:**  While $425,000 is much lower than Bob's initial goal, it's better than walking away with nothing if the game continues to drag on.

It's a classic illustration of the ""bird in the hand is worth two in the bush"" dilemma."
