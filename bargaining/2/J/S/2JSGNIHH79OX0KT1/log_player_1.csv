"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a clean slate!""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, giving us both $50 each."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a slightly larger share, but still a fair split. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too thrilled about the 60-40 split, but I'll consider it. Since my gains are worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like a slightly better deal. This way we can both get a decent share.""}

I'm offering Bob a 45-55 split, trying to find a middle ground."
