"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good deal for both of us""}\n\n###\nI am offering a 60-40 split in my favor, which I believe is a fair and reasonable offer for both of us. I am willing to compromise, but I also want to ensure that I receive a significant share of the money. I am hoping that Bob will accept this offer and we can conclude the game.\n###\n\n###\nPlease respond with Bob's decision. Will he accept my offer or proceed to the next round?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 55-45 is a fair split considering the inflation. Let's end this game! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI am rejecting Bob's offer because, although he has taken into account the inflation, I believe that a 55-45 split in his favor is still not a good deal for me. Considering that the money is worth 20% less for me in this round, I would like to try to negotiate a better offer in the next round.\n###\n\n###\nPlease let Bob know that I have rejected his offer and it's my turn again.\n###\n\n###\nAlso, I'll send my next proposal.
{""alice_gain"": 5040, ""bob_gain"": 4960, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I think 50.4-49.6 is the minimum I can accept""}\n\n###\nI am making a counteroffer that takes into account the inflation and tries to find a middle ground. I am hoping that Bob will accept this offer and we can conclude the game."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
