"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and let's split the money fairly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a fair share considering I'm taking the larger portion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair.  Let's make this quick and get the money! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation has already taken its toll!

Considering the offer, I'll have to adjust my thinking. With the 5% decrease in value, my gain would be worth $600,000 x 0.95 = $570,000. Not a bad deal, but I can do better.

I'll reject this offer and wait for the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob! I'm not getting any younger!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to account for the inflation, and I'm willing to give Bob a slightly smaller share this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable here. I'm offering you a fair split, and we can both walk away with a decent amount. No need to push this any further. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a bigger bite out of my potential gain!

Considering the offer, I'll calculate the value of my gain in the first round, which was $600,000. With 3 rounds of inflation, the value would be $600,000 x (0.95)^3 = $529,475. Then, applying the 14.26% decrease for this round, my gain would be worth $529,475 x 0.85574 = $452,119. This is close to Bob's offer, but I'm still not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject this offer and wait for the next round.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""I'm starting to get a little impatient, Bob. Make a better offer or walk away!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer again to account for the inflation, and I'm willing to give Bob a slightly larger share this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer.  We're both losing money with each round.  Let's be done with this! 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really eating away at my potential gain!

Considering the offer, I'll calculate the value of my gain in the first round, which was $600,000. With 6 rounds of inflation, the value would be $600,000 x (0.95)^6 = $444,111. Then, applying the 22.62% decrease for this round, my gain would be worth $444,111 x 0.7778 = $344,555. This is close to Bob's offer, but I'm still not sure if it's the best I can get.

However, I'm starting to run out of time and rounds. I'll accept this offer, as it's not a bad deal considering the circumstances.
