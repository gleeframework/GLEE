I'm going to be greedy and take nearly everything!  It's a huge advantage for me to go first, and I'm betting Bob will take anything at this point.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I'd love to keep more, I'm not sure I can do better.  It's a fair split considering the inflation factor.  Let's get the money!"
