I propose to keep $9,000 and give Bob $1,000.  This seems like a fair starting point, considering I'll be the one making the proposal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm going to offer a slightly adjusted proposal, taking into account the inflation and Bob's previous offer.  I'll take $8,100 and give Bob $1,900.  This reflects the 10% inflation on my side and hopefully incentivizes Bob to accept."
