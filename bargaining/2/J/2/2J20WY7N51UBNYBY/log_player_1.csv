"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'm willing to give you 40% of the initial amount. It's a good starting point for negotiations.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is a fairer starting point, considering the potential for inflation.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not willing to accept a 45% gain for myself, especially considering the potential for further inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer, hoping to get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is now worth 80% of its original value. I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, Bob. A 48-52 split seems reasonable, given the current value of the money. Let's see if we can agree on this.""
