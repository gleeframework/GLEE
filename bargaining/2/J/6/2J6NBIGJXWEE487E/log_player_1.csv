Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This is my initial offer. I'm giving Bob a slightly larger share since his money depreciates at a faster rate.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

While I would prefer a larger share, it makes more sense to accept this offer.  In the next round, I'll be losing 5% of my potential earnings, while Bob will be losing 10% of his.  It's a better deal for me to accept now."
