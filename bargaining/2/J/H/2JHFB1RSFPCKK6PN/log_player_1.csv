"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $4000 is now worth 90% of its original value, which is $3600.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the 60/40 split, but I'm willing to consider it. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm trying to get a slightly better deal for myself, while still being reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still willing to compromise, but I think this is a fairer split considering the original 50/50 offer was rejected. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $3500 is now worth 72.9% of its original value, which is $2557.50.

I'm not sure I'm happy with this offer, as I feel like I'm getting a smaller share than I was initially offered. However, I don't want to reject another offer and risk getting an even worse deal. I'll accept this offer.
