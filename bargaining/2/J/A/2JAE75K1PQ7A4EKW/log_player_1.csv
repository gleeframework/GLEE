"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a better deal this time, but still keep a majority 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll evaluate Bob's offer:

Alice's gain: $3,000 is worth 95% of $4,000 (1 - 0.05), which is $3,800 in original value.
Bob's gain: $7,000 is worth 80% of $8,750 (1 - 0.20), which is $7,000 in original value.

I'm not thrilled about the 70-30 split, but it's an improvement from the previous offer. I'll accept this offer.
