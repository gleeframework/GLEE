"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55-45 split is more fair, considering I'm taking the risk of rejection this round.  Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think a 55-45 split is fair, especially since I'm the one who made the initial offer. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""I'll meet you halfway, 52-48. Let's compromise!""}

I'm proposing a 52-48 split, which is closer to my original offer and still takes into account Bob's suggestion of a 55-45 split."
