"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can move on!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the money and Bob gets 20%. I'm trying to make a fair offer to start the game, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
