"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

This is a 50/50 split, which seems fair to me. Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since I'll be getting $400,000, which is worth 80% of the original amount due to inflation, I'll decide to accept this offer. 

```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```"
