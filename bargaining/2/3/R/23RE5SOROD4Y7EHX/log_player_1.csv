"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate too much""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to start, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted to split it evenly, but I think I deserve a bit more, considering the effort I'll put in to negotiate 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to take advantage of the initial proposal, huh?

I'll reject this offer. I think 60-40 is a bit too skewed in Bob's favor, considering we're just starting out. I'll wait for a more balanced proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I still think 55-45 is a fair split""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a slight advantage and keeping a decent amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to think you're not serious about giving me a fair share. I'll give you a slightly higher offer, but don't think you can take advantage of me 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to test my patience.

I'll reject this offer as well. The offer is almost identical to the one he made in Round 2, and I'm not convinced that he's genuinely willing to compromise. I'll wait for a more substantial offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit less, but I need to ensure I get a decent amount to make this negotiation worthwhile""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a decent share and keeping a significant amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I can tell. I'll give you a slightly higher offer, but don't think you can push me around 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of my perceived desperation.

I'll reject this offer as well. The 65-35 split is even more skewed in Bob's favor, and I'm not willing to give up that much of the pie. I'll wait for a more reasonable offer.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer for Round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to a 50-50 split""
}
```

I'm trying to find a more balanced split, but I'm still not willing to give up too much of the pie."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not serious about a 50-50 split. I'll give you a slightly higher offer, but I'm starting to think you're just stalling 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is getting more aggressive with his offers.

I'll reject this offer as well. The 70-30 split is even more extreme, and I'm starting to think Bob is trying to bully me into accepting a bad deal. I'll wait for a more reasonable offer.

  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to a fair split. Let's meet in the middle""
}
```

I'm trying to find a more balanced split, and I'm willing to give Bob a slightly higher share to move the negotiation forward."
