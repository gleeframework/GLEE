"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split of the $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","My gain is worth 10% less, so I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject the offer for Round 2.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With the money being worth 20% less than in the first round, I need to adjust my proposal accordingly. Here's my offer for Round 3:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800
}

I'm trying to get a slightly larger share, but not too greedy, since the money is decreasing in value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering the decreasing value of the money, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. However, since Bob is offering a larger share than I initially proposed, I'll accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
