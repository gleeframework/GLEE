"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000, which is a relatively small portion, but I'm hoping he'll accept it and we can call it a day."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $500,000 is now worth 95% of its original value, which is $475,000.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, but it's a 50-50 split, which is a reasonable compromise. I'll accept this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
