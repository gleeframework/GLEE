**Reasoning:**

It's getting down to the wire, and inflation is eating away at Bob's potential gains. Here's why accepting is the best (though not ideal) option:

* **Declining is risky:** If Bob rejects this offer, he gets to propose in Round 6. However, inflation will have eroded his gains even further, and there's no guarantee Alice will offer him anything better. She might offer even less, knowing it's Bob's last realistic chance.
* **Alice is unlikely to budge much:** Alice has consistently aimed for a larger share. While she's slightly decreasing her demand each round, it's unlikely she'll suddenly offer a truly even split.
* **Something is better than nothing:**  Taking $45 now, though impacted by inflation, is better than potentially ending up with nothing if the game continues and no agreement is reached. 

**It's a tough decision, but the risk of getting a worse deal in the next round outweighs the potential for a slightly better offer from Alice.**"
