Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: Considering the inflation and the previous offers, I propose we divide the money in a 75-25 ratio. This maintains a reasonable gap while accounting for the diminishing value of money in future rounds.
