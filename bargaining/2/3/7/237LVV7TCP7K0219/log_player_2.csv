"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob.  I'm offering you a generous 40%. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 10% less to Alice in each subsequent round, I might be able to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think 55% for me is a fair deal.""}\n\n###\n\nI've made an offer that takes into account the fact that the money is worth 10% less to Alice in this round, and also considering that I'm taking a risk by not accepting her initial offer. I'm hoping Alice will find this offer reasonable and accept it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The inflation is hurting us both, Bob. I'm taking a hit here, but let's be fair and split it closer to even. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nSince the money is worth the same to me as in the first round, but 19% less to Alice, I believe I can negotiate an even better deal. Alice's offer is not significantly better for me than the previous offers, considering the inflation affecting her side. I'll wait for the next round to make another counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Considering the significant impact of inflation on your side, I think 60% for me is a reasonable adjustment.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I'm taking into account that the money is worth 19% less to Alice than in the first round, which puts more pressure on her to accept a less favorable deal. I'm increasing my proposed share to 60%, hoping that Alice will accept it rather than risking further devaluation of her potential gain."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  Let's just split it evenly and be done with it.  Every round costs us both money! 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlthough Alice is offering an even split, the fact that the money is worth 34.39% less to her than in the first round means that her half is actually worth significantly less in real terms. Meanwhile, my half remains unaffected by inflation. Given this disparity, I believe I can negotiate an even better deal in the next round, so I'll reject this offer.
###\n\nAlso, note that while Alice is correct that every round costs her money due to inflation, it does not cost me anything since the value of the money remains the same for me throughout the rounds. This asymmetry in the impact of inflation gives me leverage to push for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Given the substantial impact of inflation on your side, I believe 70% for me is a fair reflection of the current situation.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I'm taking into account that the money is worth 34.39% less to Alice than in the first round, which significantly weakens her bargaining position. Since I'm not affected by inflation, I can push for an even larger share of the money. By offering Alice 30%, I'm still giving her a substantial amount, but I'm also reflecting the greatly diminished value of the money on her side. I'm hoping that Alice will realize the futility of continuing and accept this offer."
