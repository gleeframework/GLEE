"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a small difference, let's see if we can meet in the middle!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $90 and Bob gets $10. I'm starting with a relatively small difference to see if Bob is willing to accept a small amount."
