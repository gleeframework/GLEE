"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a relatively fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a smaller share, but I think 4:1 is a bit too generous for you, Alice. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth less for me, but I still need to make a decision.

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think I can do better than a 2.5:1 split. I'll try to negotiate further!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 10% less than in Round 2 for me, and the same as in Round 2 for Bob.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 2500,
  ""bob_gain"": 7500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. This is a more balanced split. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 3.3:1 split, which is closer to a 50-50 split, but still slightly in my favor. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think 9:1 is still a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really eating away at my potential gains!

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 4:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

A 9:1 split is still too skewed in Bob's favor, considering the decreasing value of the money for me. I'll try to negotiate further to get a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less for me now, but I'll try to make the best of it.

Here's my new offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 1500,
  ""bob_gain"": 8500,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, Bob. This is my last offer. Can we meet in the middle?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 1.76:1 split, which is a bit more balanced, but still slightly in my favor. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
