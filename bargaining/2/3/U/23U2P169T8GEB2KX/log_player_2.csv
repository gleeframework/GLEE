Let's see if I can do better!"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want a larger share, but 60/40 in your favor isn't fair.  Let's meet in the middle with 55/45. It's a strong offer considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm still holding out for a larger share.  Let's see if we can get closer to a 60/40 split."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting dangerously close to losing a significant chunk of the money to inflation.  My last offer is 52.5/47.5.  It's a small concession on my part, but it ensures we both walk away with a respectable sum. Let's be sensible and close this deal. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000

I'm still confident we can reach a 60/40 split. I'm not willing to accept a deal that gives Alice a larger share."

I'm still hoping we can reach a 60/40 split, but I'm willing to come down slightly to 58%. This is a fair compromise that ensures we both get a good amount.  Let's agree on this before we lose even more money.""}

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. We're both losing money with every passing round.  I'm proposing a simple 50/50 split. It's the fairest option and ensures we both walk away with a decent sum. Don't be greedy, let's just end this. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still confident we can reach a better deal than 50/50. The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, but I'm not willing to settle for an equal split just yet."
