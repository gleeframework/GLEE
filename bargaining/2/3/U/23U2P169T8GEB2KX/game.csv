600000.0,400000.0,Let's split the money 60/40. This way we both benefit from playing the game.  What do you think Bob?,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think we can both do better. Let's split it 60/40, with me taking the larger share.  This ensures we both get a decent amount, and we don't need to risk losing money in the next round.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, I understand you want a larger share, but 60/40 in your favor isn't fair.  Let's meet in the middle with 55/45. It's a strong offer considering the inflation.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
425000.0,575000.0,"Alice, let's compromise.  I'm willing to reduce my share slightly to 57.5%, but I believe that's a fair split considering the value of the money is decreasing with each round.  This way, we both get a good amount and avoid the risk of losing everything.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
525000.0,475000.0,"Bob, we're getting dangerously close to losing a significant chunk of the money to inflation.  My last offer is 52.5/47.5.  It's a small concession on my part, but it ensures we both walk away with a respectable sum. Let's be sensible and close this deal.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
420000.0,580000.0,"Alice, with each passing round, the value of the money is getting smaller.  I'm still hoping we can reach a 60/40 split, but I'm willing to come down slightly to 58%. This is a fair compromise that ensures we both get a good amount.  Let's agree on this before we lose even more money.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous. We're both losing money with every passing round.  I'm proposing a simple 50/50 split. It's the fairest option and ensures we both walk away with a decent sum. Don't be greedy, let's just end this.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
410000.0,590000.0,"Alice, we're losing money with each passing round.  I'm making a final offer. I'll take 59% and you can have 41%.  This is a good compromise that acknowledges the decreasing value of the money and ensures we both get a decent amount.  Let's end this before we lose even more.",Bob,8,
