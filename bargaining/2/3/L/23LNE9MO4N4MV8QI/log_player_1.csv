I'm going for a big chunk of the money, but I'm also giving Bob a decent amount to hopefully incentivize him to accept.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being greedy! I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I'm reducing my share a bit more to try to appease Bob, but I'm still aiming for the majority of the money.  I'm also factoring in the inflation, and I'm hoping that he'll realize it's better to take a smaller cut now than risk getting nothing later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still being stubborn. I'm not going to accept such a small share, especially with the inflation hitting me hard.  I'm going to try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

I'm lowering my share again, but I'm still hoping to secure a significant portion of the money. With the inflation hitting me hard, I need to make a move before it gets worse.  I'm hoping Bob will see that it's in his best interest to accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse, but I'm still not going to accept it. I'm hoping that he'll eventually realize that it's better to take a smaller share now than risk getting nothing later. I'm going to try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}
```

Time is running out and inflation is eating away at my gains. I'm taking another big gamble here by offering a significant amount to Bob, but I'm hoping he'll realize that this might be the best offer he's going to get.  This is a risky move, but I'm hoping it pays off."
