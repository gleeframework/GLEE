"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

I propose to take $9000 and give Bob $1000. Since I'm the first to propose, I want to maximize my share, but I'll also be fair and leave Bob with a small amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more money, the inflation means my $9000 is now worth less than $7200.  It's better to take the $1000 now than risk getting nothing in the next round."
