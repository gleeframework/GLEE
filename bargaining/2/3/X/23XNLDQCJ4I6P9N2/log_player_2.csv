Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to divide the money now. Let's end this game. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nSince the money is worth less now, I think a 50/50 split is a reasonable compromise, and it's better to end the game now rather than risking further inflation."
