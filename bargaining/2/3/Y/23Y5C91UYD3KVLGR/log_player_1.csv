"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it to get the game started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll have to be more cautious. However, Bob's offer is quite aggressive, and I'm not sure if I want to accept it.

I'll reject the offer for now and try to make a counteroffer in the next round.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","In round 3, the money is worth 25% less than in the first round due to inflation. Considering this, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55
}
```

This offer takes into account the reduced value of money and gives Bob a slightly larger share to try to reach a deal."
