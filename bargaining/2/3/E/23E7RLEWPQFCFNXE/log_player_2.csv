Although not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in Round 5 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:**  With only 7 rounds remaining, the pressure is mounting. Delaying further significantly risks both players walking away with nothing. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** The longer the negotiation drags on, the less the money is worth.  While Alice's offer isn't perfect, waiting for a significantly better deal in later rounds is increasingly unlikely.
* **Uncertainty of Future Offers:** There's no guarantee that Alice will offer a better deal in subsequent rounds. She might even offer less, putting Bob in a worse position.

While getting 44% isn't ideal, it's better than the risk of getting nothing if we continue to reject offers and run out of rounds."
