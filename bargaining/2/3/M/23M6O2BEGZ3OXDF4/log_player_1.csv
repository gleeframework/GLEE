"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let us share fairly""}\n\nI am offering to take 60% of the money, which is $6000, and give Bob 40%, which is $4000. I believe this is a fair division, considering I am the one making the first offer. The message ""Let us share fairly"" is to convey my intention of being reasonable and hoping Bob will accept this offer to save us both from the effects of inflation in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was generous, but I think this split accounts for me having to wait a round to propose. 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI am rejecting Bob's offer because, despite his message suggesting the split accounts for him having to wait a round, the division seems less fair than my initial proposal. Given that inflation has reduced the value of the money by 5%, accepting less than half of the now devalued amount doesn't seem like the best option. I'll propose a new division in the next round, hoping to find a more favorable or truly fair split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5700, ""bob_gain"": 4300, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet closer to the middle.""}\n\nGiven that we've now lost 10% of the value due to two rounds of inflation, I'm adjusting my proposal to take slightly less than initially offered but still aiming for a higher share to compensate for the loss in value over time. My message suggests finding a middle ground, considering the impact of inflation on our potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the fairest option.  Let's close this out before inflation eats away at the value further. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nGiven that we are now in the fourth round and the money has lost over 14% of its value due to inflation, a 50/50 split seems like the most reasonable option to accept. Further rounds would only continue to devalue our potential earnings, and Bob's message suggests this is his final offer. Accepting this ensures we both walk away with something rather than risking further loss from inflation."
