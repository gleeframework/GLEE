**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting greedier and the inflation is working in my favor.  It's risky, but I need to hold out for a better offer. The longer this goes on, the more desperate Alice will become, and the less her share will be worth to her."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Let's be realistic.  The inflation is hurting us both.  A 50/50 split is the fairest option at this point."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is clearly aiming for a larger share, but the tide is turning in my favor with the inflation. Offering a 50/50 split might seem generous, but it:

* **Establishes a strong negotiating position:**  It shows I'm willing to compromise, but not be walked all over. 
* **Highlights the impact of inflation:** It emphasizes that every round makes the potential winnings smaller for both of us.
* **Increases the chances of acceptance:** Alice is smart enough to see that her share is rapidly losing value. This offer may be her best bet at this stage."
