Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable. My initial offer was too high, your counter-offer swung things too far the other way.  I'm willing to meet in the middle with a 55/45 split in my favor.  The money is losing value fast for both of us, let's settle this now. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
