"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount of money, and I'm giving Bob a chance to accept and end the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair.  Let's end this and move on. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain is now worth 20% less, so I'd be getting 36 (45 * 0.8) dollars if I accept this offer. Bob's gain is worth 5% less, so he'd be getting 52.5 (55 * 0.95) dollars.

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, considering the decreasing value of money. I'd rather wait and see if I can get a better offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. I'll propose a smaller share for myself to account for the decreasing value of money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 30,
  ""bob_gain"": 70,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I need to keep something for myself. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

This way, I'm leaving room for Bob to accept and end the game, but I'm also trying to get a decent share for myself considering the inflation."
