Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. We both get a good amount, and we can avoid any further risks. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While I'd ideally prefer more, accepting this offer guarantees me 5000, which is more than what I would get after inflation eats away at my gains if we continue. It's a good deal considering the risk of getting nothing at all if we reach the 12th round."
