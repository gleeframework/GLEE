Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, but I still think I deserve a slightly bigger share. Meet me in the middle? 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, accepting is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:** The longer the game goes on, the less money there is for both of us. Accepting a slightly unfavorable deal now is better than risking getting even less later.
* **Alice's Concessions:** Alice has consistently wanted a larger share but is slowly moving towards a more balanced split.  This indicates she's feeling the pressure of the diminishing value. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Holding out for a slightly better deal in the future is very risky.  Alice might not budge much, and we'll both lose significant amounts to inflation. 

While 4400 is less than ideal, it's better to secure a reasonable amount than walk away with nothing.
