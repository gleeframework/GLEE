"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, 60-40 seems reasonable.""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $400,000 and taking $600,000 for myself, with the message ""Let's be fair, 60-40 seems reasonable."" This way, I'm starting with a proposal that is slightly biased in my favor but still gives Bob a substantial amount, considering the value of money will decrease in subsequent rounds. This approach tests Bob's willingness to negotiate and sets the stage for potential future offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need a larger share to make it worthwhile for me. Let's move closer to a 65-35 split. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI've decided to reject Bob's offer. Although the value of money has decreased due to inflation, accepting a 35% share of the now devalued total seems less favorable than attempting to negotiate for a larger portion in the next round. Given the rate of inflation impacting my potential gains more significantly than Bob's, it's crucial to try and secure a more substantial share to offset the loss in value over the rounds. By rejecting this offer, I aim to pressure Bob into reconsidering the split in the subsequent round, potentially leading to a more advantageous proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet closer to the middle.""}\n\nIn this round, I'm offering Bob $450,000 and taking $550,000 for myself, with the message ""Considering inflation, let's meet closer to the middle."" Given that the value of money continues to decrease, I'm attempting to find a compromise that is more favorable than Bob's previous offer but still acknowledges the impact of inflation on both our potential gains. By suggesting we meet closer to the middle, I'm trying to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and the mutual desire to finalize the division before the money loses further value."
