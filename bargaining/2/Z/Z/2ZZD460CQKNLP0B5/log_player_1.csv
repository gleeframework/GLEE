Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split the money more evenly.  I think $5500 for me and $4500 for you is a fair starting point, considering the value of the money will decrease in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{
