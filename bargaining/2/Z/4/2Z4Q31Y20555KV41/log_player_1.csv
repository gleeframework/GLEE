"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept it and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous, now it's time to be fair. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so I'm looking at a gain of $810,000 (900,000 * 0.9) if I accept Bob's offer. 

I don't think I can do better than that, so I'll accept Bob's offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
