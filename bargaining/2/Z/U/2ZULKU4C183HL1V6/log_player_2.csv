"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 75-25. It's fair considering the diminishing value of money. 
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm Bob, and I'm not satisfied with getting only 25% of the money, especially since I know the money will lose value with each round. I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think a 60-40 split is more fair. We both get a decent share, and it leaves room for negotiation in future rounds.""}
