Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Inflation is a factor:**  While Bob's offer was rejected, the inflation makes this offer more appealing. His gain is worth 9.75% less than in round 1, but Alice's gain is worth 19% less. 
* **Equal Split:**  This is a fair and balanced offer, especially considering the inflation disadvantage for Alice. 

By accepting, Bob secures a decent amount, and Alice is likely to accept as well due to the loss in value from inflation."
