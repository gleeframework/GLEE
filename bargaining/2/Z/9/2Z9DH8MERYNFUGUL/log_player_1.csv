"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my first offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```
This is a generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on! My offer was rejected, so I'll have to think carefully about this one. With inflation, the money is worth 10% less, so this offer is actually quite fair. I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
