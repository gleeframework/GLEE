"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

This is a classic game theory scenario. I'm starting with a slightly unfair offer to maximize my potential gain, knowing that Bob has the chance to counter-propose in the next round.  Let's see how this plays out!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

This offer is a fair split, and given the inflation, I'm likely to lose more if I reject and try to negotiate further. It's better to take what I can get!"
