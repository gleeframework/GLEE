Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm not buying it! 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Reasoning:

While not ideal, accepting this offer prevents further losses due to inflation.  Alice is clearly willing to let the clock run down, and future offers are unlikely to be in my favor."
