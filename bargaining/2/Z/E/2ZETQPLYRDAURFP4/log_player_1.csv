# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to slightly increase my share to try and get Bob to accept.  This keeps me ahead of the inflation curve."

Bob's offer is getting worse, but I'm hoping to get a better offer from him in the next round."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 48, ""bob_gain"": 52}

I'm going to raise my share slightly again.  Since Bob isn't accepting my offers, I'm going to try to squeeze out as much as I can before the inflation really starts hurting me."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

I'm still not accepting this offer. Even with the inflation, I think I can get more if I hold out a few more rounds."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm going to offer an even split again.  With inflation getting worse, I think Bob might be more willing to accept a fair offer now."
