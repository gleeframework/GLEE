"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can adjust in future rounds if needed.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting 60 dollars and Bob getting 40 dollars. I think this is a good starting point, and we can reassess our positions as the game progresses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share this round, but still willing to negotiate 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept this offer. I was hoping for a more balanced split, and this proposal is quite skewed towards Bob's favor. I'll wait for the next round to make a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 45-55 is a more reasonable split. Let's see if you're willing to meet me in the middle.""}

I've adjusted my proposal to give Bob a slightly larger share, but still maintaining a relatively balanced split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I still think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept this offer. Although I'm getting closer to Bob's desired share, I still think 40-60 is too skewed towards Bob's favor. I'll try to negotiate further and aim for a more balanced split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's split the remaining money evenly, 50-50. It's our last chance to reach an agreement before the game ends.""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which I think is a fair and reasonable compromise. If Bob is willing to accept this offer, we can avoid going to the final round and risk getting nothing."
