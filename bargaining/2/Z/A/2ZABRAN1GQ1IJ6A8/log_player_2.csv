"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, I get a bit more

# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""I'm willing to be generous, but let's make it closer to even. This is my final offer.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  Both our potential gains are decreasing each round. It's in Bob's best interest to reach an agreement quickly. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  By offering slightly more than Alice initially proposed for herself, Bob demonstrates a willingness to negotiate but also sets a firm boundary. 
* **Finality:** Stating ""This is my final offer"" introduces a sense of urgency and may encourage Alice to accept rather than risk further losses from inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll meet you halfway on your last offer, but I still think I deserve a bit more 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Unfavorable Trend:** Alice is consistently aiming for a larger share, even though the value for both of us is decreasing. Accepting now sets a bad precedent.
* **Calculation:** While she claims to meet ""halfway,""  her offer is only slightly better than her initial 60/40 split considering the inflation. 
* **Leverage:** The devaluation hurts Alice more than Bob. By round 4, she'll be losing value much faster, potentially making her more agreeable to a fairer split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4700, ""alice_gain"": 5300, ""message"": ""Time is running out, Alice.  This is a fair deal considering the circumstances.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Concession:** Bob shows flexibility by increasing his offer slightly from round 2. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise, but not at any cost.
* **Highlighting Urgency:** The message emphasizes the time pressure and the fact that further delays hurt both players.
* **Framing as Fair:** Bob positions this offer as a reasonable compromise in light of the decreasing value, hoping to appeal to Alice's sense of fairness."
