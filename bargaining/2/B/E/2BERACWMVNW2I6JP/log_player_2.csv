"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the money 3:1 in favor of you, Bob. I believe fairness is important, but also practicality. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While the offer is generous, it's worth waiting to see if Alice will offer more in the next round. The inflation will affect the value of the money, and waiting could be beneficial."
