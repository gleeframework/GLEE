"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll give you $100,000, and I'll take the rest. It's a fair deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept it quickly so we can move on to the next round and I can try to get an even better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest way to start. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the value of the money is decreasing, so I need to be more cautious with my decisions.

I don't think splitting it evenly is the fairest way to start, considering the initial proposal I made in Round 1. I was willing to give Bob $100,000, which is a significant amount, but now he's offering to give me the same amount as he wants for himself? I'm not convinced.

I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in Round 3.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I still think I deserve the majority. Take $300,000 and let's move on.""
}
```

I'm trying to balance being generous while also getting a good deal for myself. With the inflation, I need to be mindful of the decreasing value of the money, but I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit less than half, but I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly, and I need to be more cautious with my decisions.

While I'm not thrilled about giving Bob a larger share, I think this offer is a reasonable compromise. I'm not sure if I'll get a better deal in the next round, and I don't want to risk losing out on $400,000.

I'll accept this offer.
