"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

This is a fair and equal split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 60, you can have 40. It's a fair deal! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is a bit lopsided, but I'll consider it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer because I think I can do better. I'll try to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a counteroffer. Since Bob offered 60, I'll try to get closer to 50, but also slightly above it to account for the inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 52,
  ""bob_gain"": 48,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit less than 50, but still a fair deal. Your turn!""
}
```

This offer is a bit more generous than my initial offer, but still leaves me with a slight edge. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 55, you can have 45. I'm trying to get a better deal this time! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Another offer from Bob! This one is closer to 50, but still slightly biased towards him.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer as well. I'm starting to think that Bob is trying to get a better deal, but I'm not willing to give up more than 50. I'll try to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get closer to 50. Since Bob's offer was 55, I'll try to get him to meet me halfway.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 51,
  ""bob_gain"": 49,
  ""message"": ""I'm not budging from 50, but I'll meet you halfway at 51. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

This offer is a bit more aggressive, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it this time."
