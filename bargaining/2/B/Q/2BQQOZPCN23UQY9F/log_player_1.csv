 I propose a 9000-1000 split in my favor, as I'm confident that this is a fair offer.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best course of action.  Bob's offer is fair, and with inflation, the money I gain is worth the same, while Bob's share is worth 5% less.  It's better to secure a 50/50 split than risk a worse outcome in subsequent rounds."
