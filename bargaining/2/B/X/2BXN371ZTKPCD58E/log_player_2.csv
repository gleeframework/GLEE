Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing tough, but time is running out for me more than for her.  While this offer is terrible given the inflation, I need to show I'm willing to go even lower in the hopes she'll accept a counter offer. If I don't, I risk walking away with nothing."

**Reasoning:**

I need to signal to Alice that I'm willing to negotiate downwards, even though it hurts.  By offering slightly more than her last offer, I'm showing flexibility but also maintaining a firm stance. This is a risky move, but the clock is ticking, and I need to act decisively."
