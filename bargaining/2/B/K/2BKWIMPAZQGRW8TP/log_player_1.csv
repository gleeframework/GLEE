"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10} 
```

I'm going to start with a pretty aggressive offer. I'll take 90% and leave Bob with 10%. This sets the tone that I'm willing to negotiate, but I also want to secure the majority of the money.  Let's see what Bob does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still pretty generous, but I'm going to reject it.  I'm holding out for more, especially since inflation is affecting my gains more than his. I'm going to try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I'm going to offer Bob 15% this time.  This is a compromise from my last offer, but I'm still trying to secure a larger share for myself. It's important to find a balance between being assertive and being reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 65 
# Bob gain: 35 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is getting risky. Inflation is really hurting my gains, and I'm not sure if I can do much better. I'm accepting Bob's offer, even though it's less than I wanted initially. It's better than getting nothing!"
