"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

This is a fair starting point, as it splits the money evenly. Since the money is worth less for Alice with each passing round, she needs to be strategic with her offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than nothing, Alice can still do better. She has 10 rounds left, and the money is losing value for her. Rejecting the offer allows her to make a counter-proposal and try to secure a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500}
```

Alice is willing to compromise to avoid further inflation. This offer still favors Bob slightly but ensures that she gets a decent share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's money is losing value quickly, but she should still reject. While Bob's offer is tempting, Alice has 8 rounds left to make a counter-proposal. This gives her time to potentially get a better deal or at least minimize her losses."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 4000, ""bob_gain"": 6000}
```

Alice needs to be bold here. While her money is losing value rapidly, she can still make a counter-offer that is more favorable to her. This offer keeps the split close to Bob's last offer but gives Alice a better share of the money.  This also might incentivize Bob to accept, as further rounds will only see Alice's share depreciate further."
