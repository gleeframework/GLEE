"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. Let's split it 90/10.  Fair deal, right? 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject this offer. Even though it's a lot of money, I'm hoping I can get a better deal.  Let's see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 6000,
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's be a little more realistic, Alice. How about a 60/40 split?  It's still a good deal for both of us.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob. I'm willing to compromise.  Let's split it 70/30.  This time, let's make it happen! 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'm taking the offer. Even though it's less than I was hoping for, the inflation is really starting to bite.  I'd rather have something than risk getting nothing at all."
