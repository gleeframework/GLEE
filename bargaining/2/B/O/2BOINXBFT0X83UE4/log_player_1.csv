"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the money, which is $6,000, and giving Bob 40%, which is $4,000. I've attached a message saying ""Let's split fairly"" to try to persuade Bob to accept my offer. Let me know what Bob decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a bit more in my favor 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll respond with:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think Bob's offer is fair enough, so I'll reject it and try to make a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 3:


{
  ""alice_gain"": 5700,
  ""bob_gain"": 4300,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""
}


I've taken into account the inflation and tried to meet Bob halfway between our previous offers. I'm hoping this one will be more acceptable to him. Let me know what he decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Getting closer, but not quite there 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer again, hoping to get a better deal in the next round. The inflation is taking a toll, but I think I can still do better than this."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 5400,
  ""bob_gain"": 4600,
  ""message"": ""Last chance before it's worthless""
}\n\nI'm making a slightly more aggressive offer this time, trying to take advantage of the fact that the money is losing value quickly. I'm hoping Bob will realize that it's better to accept this offer rather than risk losing even more value in the next round. Let's see what he decides!"
