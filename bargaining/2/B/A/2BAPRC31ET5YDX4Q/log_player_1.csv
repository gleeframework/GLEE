Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose taking 9000$ and leaving 1000$ for Bob. Since the money loses value faster for you than for Bob, I'm aiming for a bigger share early on.  Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer is the most rational choice.  The money is depreciating quickly, and if we reach the final rounds, we both might end up with nothing. This offer guarantees me a decent sum, even with the inflation factored in."
