"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to split it 50/50, but I think we can do better than that. I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share to get us closer to a deal. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
