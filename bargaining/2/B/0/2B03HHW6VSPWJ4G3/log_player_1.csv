"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is a 60-40 split, which seems fair to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth 5% less for Bob, I'll consider that in my decision. I think I can do better than a 50-50 split, but I'm not sure if I want to push for a more extreme split.

I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the money worth 10% less in total now, I'll aim for a slightly more favorable split. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This is a 55-45 split, which I think is a good balance between fairness and getting a decent amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 14.26% less for Bob, I think this offer is actually quite reasonable for me. A 50-50 split is a fair outcome, and I don't see a reason to reject it.

I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```"
