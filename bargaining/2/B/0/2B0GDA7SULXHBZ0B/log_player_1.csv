"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm offering you $300,000, and I'll take the remaining $700,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the $700,000 I would gain in the first round is now worth $560,000 in the second round. 

I'll reject this offer because I'd rather have more money, even if it's worth less in real terms. 

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the second round, the $560,000 I would gain in the second round is now worth $448,000 in the third round. 

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the value of the money in the fourth round. The $700,000 I would gain in the first round is now worth $356,000 in the fourth round (1 - 0.208 - 0.208^2 - 0.208^3 = 0.488, so 1 - 0.488 = 0.512, and 700000 * 0.512 = 356800).

I'll accept this offer because I'd rather have $400,000 now than risk getting less in future rounds.
