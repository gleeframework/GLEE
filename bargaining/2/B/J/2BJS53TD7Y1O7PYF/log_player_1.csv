"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get a good start, I'll give you a fair share for now. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take a slightly bigger share this time. Consider this a fair offer. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, so I'll consider the offer in terms of the effective amount I'll receive.

In this round, the total amount is 10,000, but due to inflation, it's equivalent to 8,000 from the first round. So, if I accept Bob's offer, I'll effectively get 4,000, which is 50% of the effective amount.

I'm not sure if this is a good deal, so I'll reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, the money is worth 40% of its original value due to the 20% inflation effect in the first two rounds.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bigger share this time, but I still need to get a decent amount to make it worth my while. Consider this a reasonable offer.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not convinced you're giving me a good deal. I'll take a bigger share this time, but I'm still willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. So, the effective amount is now 5,216 (10,000 * 0.488).

Considering the offer, I'll effectively get 3,000, which is about 57.5% of the effective amount. This is a bit lower than my previous offer, but I'm not sure if I want to accept a smaller share.

I'll reject the offer.

Round 5

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,

# Bob's message: I'm getting impatient, I want a bigger share. This is my final offer, take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 1500 
# Bob gain: 8500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the money is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. So, the effective amount is now 3,678 (10,000 * 0.6723).

Considering the offer, I'll effectively get 1,500, which is about 40.8% of the effective amount. This is a relatively small share, and I'm not sure if it's worth accepting.

I'll reject the offer.

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, the money is worth 73.26% of its original value due to the 20% inflation effect in the first six rounds.

# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the money is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. So, the effective amount is now 2,512 (10,000 * 0.7903).

Considering the offer, I'll effectively get 1,000, which is about 39.8% of the effective amount. This is a very small share, and I'm not sure if it's worth accepting, especially since Bob is being quite aggressive with his offer.

However, I also consider the fact that we're running out of time, and if I reject this offer, I might end up with nothing. I'll accept the offer.
