"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can both go home happy!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the $1,000,000 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. I'm offering you a good deal, but I'm sure we can both get a better outcome if we keep negotiating. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, my gain of $450,000 is now worth 95% of $450,000, which is $427,500. Bob's gain of $550,000 is now worth 90% of $550,000, which is $495,000.

I'm not sure if this is the best I can get, but I'm willing to take it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
