"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives me a large portion of the money, but I recognize that Bob might not accept it.  I'm hoping to secure a good deal early on before inflation starts to eat away at our earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my initial offer, and it doesn't account for the inflation. It's better to see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 720000, ""bob_gain"": 280000}
```

This offer takes into account the inflation from the previous rounds, giving me a larger share while still leaving Bob a significant portion. It's a compromise that might be more appealing than rejecting each other's offers for another round."
