I'm Bob, and I'm going to play strategically. While 400,000 is a decent amount, I know I can likely get more if I push for a better deal. Let's see what happens in the next round!"

I'm going to accept this offer. While I still believe I deserve a slightly bigger share, it's better to take what I can get at this point.  We're both losing money with each round, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all."
