"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with this""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. Let's split it evenly this time. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'm not too concerned about the inflation. However, I'm not thrilled about accepting an offer that gives Bob a bigger share than me.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still holding out for a slightly better deal for myself."

# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's split it 55/45 this time.   
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm starting to feel the pinch of inflation, but I'm still trying to hold out for a better deal.

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my previous proposal, I'm not thrilled about giving up 15% of my share. I'm going to try to negotiate a bit more.
