Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose a 50/50 split, as it seems like the fairest starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

I'm increasing my share slightly, as the value of Bob's money is decreasing faster than mine. I think this is still a reasonable compromise given the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a better deal, the inflation is hurting Bob significantly more than me. It's likely his offers will get worse, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all."
