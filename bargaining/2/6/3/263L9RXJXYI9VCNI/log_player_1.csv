"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. We can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a small chunk, but I think I deserve more considering the game's inflation 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 20% less, so I'd be getting $3000, which is worth $2400 in the previous round's value.

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 75-25 split, especially considering the value of the money has decreased for me. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the previous offers and the effects of inflation, I'll make a new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think this split is more reasonable given the inflation.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42-58 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than the previous offers. Let's see if Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think I deserve more considering the game's inflation and my previous offers 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is hitting hard! My gain is now worth 48.8% less than the original $6000, so I'd be getting $3120 in the first round's value.

Considering the previous offers and the effects of inflation, I'm not thrilled about this offer. I'll respond:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 20-80 split, especially considering the value of the money has decreased significantly for me. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation taking a bigger toll on my potential gain, I'll have to be more aggressive in my proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. Let's find a fair split before things get worse.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than the previous offers. Let's see if Bob will accept!"
