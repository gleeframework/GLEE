Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money 60-40, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me $600,000 and Bob $400,000. This is a generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it to get the game started!"

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I need to be more cautious. However, I'm not willing to accept a 70-30 split. I'll try to negotiate a better deal.

```
