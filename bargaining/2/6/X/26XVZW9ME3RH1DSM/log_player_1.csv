"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor, knowing that the money will be worth less in subsequent rounds. This should incentivize Bob to accept, but leaves room for negotiation if he rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While this offer is tempting, it's important to remember that the money I receive is worth even less now due to inflation. I'm still in a strong negotiating position and can likely secure a better deal in the following rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
``` 

I'm lowering my initial offer slightly to 80/20, recognizing the increasing impact of inflation. I believe this is still a fair offer for both of us, as we're both losing money each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my initial goal, the inflation is seriously impacting my gains. I'm still losing more money each round than Bob, and I can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to offer 70/30, even though inflation is hitting me hard. I think this is a fair compromise given the situation and could potentially get Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

While I'm losing a lot to inflation, Bob's offer is still too low. It's better to keep negotiating and try to secure a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again to 60/40. While inflation is hitting me hard, I'm still aiming for a significant share of the remaining value. This is a risk, but I believe it's necessary to try and secure a better outcome for myself."
