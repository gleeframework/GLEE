Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the pressure of inflation, but your previous offer was too low. This is my counter-offer. It gives me a larger share, but it's still a good deal for you before inflation shrinks your potential gains further.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but we need to settle this soon.  This offer is a compromise acknowledging the impact of inflation on your share.  Let's be realistic and close the deal. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of my shrinking pot. While the pressure is on, accepting this offer would mean I lose over 75% of my potential earnings from round 1. I need to hold out for a better deal, but I need to start being more aggressive to signal I'm willing to risk it all as we approach the deadline."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. Inflation is a factor, yes, but I'd rather walk away with nothing than be lowballed. This is my final offer - take it or leave it.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to play hardball. By significantly increasing my demand and presenting it as my ""final offer,"" I'm aiming to:

* **Signal seriousness:** Alice might be getting complacent, thinking she can keep pushing me lower. 
* **Introduce risk:** The ""take it or leave it"" approach adds pressure on her, highlighting the very real possibility of both of us losing everything.
* **Maintain some leverage:** While this offer is a lot closer to even, it still gives me a slight advantage if she accepts, considering the inflation impact. 

This is a calculated risk, but the clock is ticking, and waiting any longer only weakens my position."
