"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

This means I'm offering to give Bob $200,000 and keep $800,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced values due to inflation, I'll consider Bob's new offer.

Since the money is worth less, I'd like to get a larger share. I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, I'll aim for a higher share. Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
