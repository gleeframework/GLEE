"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""
}
```

I'm offering to take 55% of the money ($5,500) and give Bob 45% ($4,500). I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable and fair offer and accept it to avoid further inflation."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your share is only getting smaller, let's make a deal. 
# Alice gain: 4545 
# Bob gain: 5455 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

  ""message"": ""Don't wait, inflation is coming""
}

I've lowered my offer slightly, taking into account the inflation that has already occurred, but still trying to maintain a slightly higher share for myself. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in accepting this offer before the money loses even more value."
