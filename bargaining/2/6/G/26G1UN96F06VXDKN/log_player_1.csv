Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a good starting point, Alice. However, the inflation hits you harder than me. Let's make it 45/55. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

""alice_gain"": 62,
""bob_gain"": 38,
""message"": ""The inflation is real, Bob. I need a larger share to make it worthwhile. 62/38 is my final offer.""

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the inflation is hitting you hard. This is my final offer. It's important we both walk away with something. 
# Alice gain: 52 
# Bob gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 
**Reasoning:** 

While Bob is right that getting something is better than nothing, we are still in the early rounds. Accepting 52 now means losing almost half its initial value due to inflation.  Bob's offer also barely budged from his previous offer, indicating he might be underestimating the impact of inflation on my returns.  I'm willing to push my luck a bit further."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. This offer is the same as my first one.  We're running out of time, and the inflation is only getting worse for both of us.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Retreat:**  I'm stepping back from my escalating demands (62 in the previous round). This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate while still aiming for a larger share.
* **Highlighting the Common Enemy:** Reminding Bob about the increasing inflation keeps the pressure on him.  We're both losing money with each passing round.
* **Creating Urgency:**  By stating we're running out of time, I'm hoping Bob will be more likely to accept a less favorable deal now rather than risk getting nothing later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we need to settle this now. A 50/50 split is the fairest option. Time is running out! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  We're past the halfway point, and the inflation is eating away at any potential gains.  While 50/50 isn't ideal, it's becoming increasingly risky to hold out for a better deal.
* **Bob's Movement:** Bob has finally moved significantly from his initial offer.  This suggests he's feeling the pressure of the dwindling time and is serious about reaching an agreement. 
* **Avoiding a Loss:** Waiting any longer significantly increases the chances of walking away with nothing. A 50/50 split guarantees I receive something, even with the inflation."
