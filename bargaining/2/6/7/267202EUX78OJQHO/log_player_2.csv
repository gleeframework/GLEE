Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Splitting evenly is not enough for me, considering I'm not affected by inflation 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000

It's getting risky. Accepting this offer ensures I get something, even though the inflation is hurting me.  It's better than the possibility of getting nothing in the later rounds."
