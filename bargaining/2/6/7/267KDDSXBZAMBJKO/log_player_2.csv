"Round 1
Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Still willing to compromise, but I need a bit more than 45% 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is feeling the pressure of inflation more than I am. While her offer is better, it's still heavily in her favor.  I'll hold out for a slightly better deal, knowing her position weakens each round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 480000,
""alice_gain"": 520000,
""message"": ""This is my final offer, Alice. It's a fair split considering the time pressure and the inflation working against you. Let's close this deal and both walk away with something!""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show a willingness to compromise, but making it clear this is my bottom line. The ""final offer"" tactic can push someone to accept, especially with the added pressure of inflation. This way, I'm aiming for a favorable outcome while still mitigating the risk of getting nothing."
