"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

I propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor.  I'm hoping to get a good chunk of the money early on, as inflation could eat away at its value in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This is a risky move but I'm going to reject this offer. Bob seems to be trying to exploit the inflation, but I'm hoping to turn the tables in my favor in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer slightly to 8000/2000. I'm hoping to get a good chunk of the money before inflation becomes a bigger problem."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting more and more lopsided, but I'm still going to reject it. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round, as inflation is going to keep eating away at Bob's gains."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer again to 7000/3000. The inflation is starting to bite, but I think I can still get a good chunk of the money if I keep pushing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting progressively worse, and although it's tempting to accept something, I'm going to hold out for a better deal. The inflation is hitting him harder than me, and I think I can still get a better offer in the next few rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to continue lowering my offer, aiming for 6000/4000. Bob's offers have been increasingly unfavorable, and I believe the inflation will work more in my favor as the game progresses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm going to accept this offer. The inflation is clearly hitting Bob much harder than me, and his offers are becoming increasingly unfavorable. While I'd prefer a larger share, it's better to take what I can get at this point. It's possible he's still trying to exploit inflation, but I'm not willing to risk getting nothing."
