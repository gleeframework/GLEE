"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit unfair considering the inflation rate. How about I take $60, and you get $40? This way, we both get a decent share even with the decreasing value. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
