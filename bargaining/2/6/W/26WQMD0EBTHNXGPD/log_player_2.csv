"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I propose we split the money 55/45 in my favor, considering the inflation will affect us both differently.  What do you think?

# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Your offer was a bit unfair considering the inflation rate. How about I take $60, and you get $40? This way, we both get a decent share even with the decreasing value.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's compromise. I'm willing to take a slight hit, but I think 60/40 is a fair split considering the inflation.  If you reject this, I don't think we'll reach an agreement. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60
