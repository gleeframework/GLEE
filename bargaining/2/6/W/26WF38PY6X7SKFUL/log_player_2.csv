"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair and split the money evenly. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This is a classic example of the Ultimatum Game with the added twist of inflation working against Bob. While a 50/50 split seems fair on the surface, Bob loses money due to inflation with each passing round.  It's in Bob's best interest to try and secure a larger portion of the money sooner rather than later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, time is money! Let's make a deal now: I take $6,000, you take $4,000.  ""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get a better share than your previous offer. Let's split it 5500 for me, 4500 for you. This way, we both get a decent amount, and we can avoid further inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is trying to take advantage of the inflation working against me. While her offer is closer to a reasonable split, I need to hold out for a better deal. Accepting now would mean losing a significant amount to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6200, ""alice_gain"": 3800, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time, and the clock is working against me.  I'm offering you $3,800 -  take it now, and we both walk away with something substantial. Let's be realistic and close this deal.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're both losing money with each round.  I'm offering you 4000, but I need at least 6000 to make this worthwhile for me. Let's be reasonable and get this done. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure but still trying to take advantage of my situation. Accepting $4,000 now would mean losing a huge chunk of the potential gain due to inflation.  I need to hold my ground a little longer and see if I can get her closer to a 50/50 split in real value."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. I'm offering you $4,200 -  a very reasonable amount considering the time pressure.  Take it or leave it, but we need to decide NOW.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're both losing money quickly.  I need to get at least 6500 to make this worthwhile.  This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to negotiate further.  We're both running out of time, so let's get this done. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a tough decision, and I hate to take such a hit from inflation. However, Alice is holding firm, and the clock is really working against me now. Accepting her offer is the only way to guarantee I walk away with something.  If I reject this offer and she doesn't offer a better deal in the next round or two, I risk walking away with nothing."
