"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a very unequal proposal. I figure Bob is likely to accept, as even a small amount is better than nothing. Let's see how this plays out!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject Bob's offer. It's my turn to propose now, and I'll be more fair this time!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm going to propose an even split this time. It seems like a fair and reasonable offer that Bob should accept."
