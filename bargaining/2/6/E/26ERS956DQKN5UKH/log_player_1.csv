"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives me a larger share (900,000) while still leaving Bob a decent amount (100,000).  I believe this is a fair starting point, as it allows for potential negotiation in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While I'm not happy about the decreased share, I believe I can get a better deal.  Bob's offer is significantly worse than my initial proposal, and I'm confident I can negotiate a more favorable outcome in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000} 
```

I'm reducing my share slightly to account for the inflation and to demonstrate my willingness to compromise. This offer still gives me a larger share than Bob's proposal, but it also shows that I am open to negotiation."
