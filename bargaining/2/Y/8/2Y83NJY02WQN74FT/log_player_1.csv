"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take 80% and you can take 20%""
}
```

I'm offering to take $8,000 and leaving $2,000 for Bob. I'm hoping this is a reasonable starting point for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a better deal this time. Take 40% and I'll take 60% 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my $8,000 gain in Round 1 is now worth $6,400 in Round 2, and Bob's $2,000 gain is now worth $1,800.

Bob's new offer is to take 60% and leave 40% for me. I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, considering the inflation.

I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 20% less than in Round 2, so my gain is worth 64% of the original value, and Bob's gain is worth 90% of the original value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4800,
  ""bob_gain"": 5200,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a bit more, but I think this is a fair split considering the inflation""
}
```

I'm offering to take $4,800 and leaving $2,200 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of. This is my best offer so far. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my $8,000 gain in Round 1 is now worth $4,160 in Round 4, and Bob's $2,000 gain is now worth $1,461.

Bob's new offer is to take 55% and leave 45% for me. I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, considering the inflation and the fact that Bob is being more generous than before.

However, I'm starting to feel the pressure of the time constraint, and I don't want to risk losing out on a decent offer. I'll accept this offer.
