"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation reducing my potential gain, I'll have to be more aggressive in my next proposal. I reject Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

It's my turn now!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the money worth 5% less again, my offer is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}
```

I'm trying to get a better deal this time!"
