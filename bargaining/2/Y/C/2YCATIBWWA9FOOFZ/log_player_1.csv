Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, my turn. Let's be practical, I'm losing money with each round, so this offer is better for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""The clock is ticking, Bob. I'm being more than fair considering you're losing money every round we play.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm losing serious value, and this is my final offer before I'm forced to accept a much smaller amount. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, it's time to cut my losses. Bob is clearly willing to push this to a point where he'll accept a smaller amount, likely less than the 50/50 split.  Taking the $4,500 now ensures I get something rather than risking a worse outcome as the game continues."
