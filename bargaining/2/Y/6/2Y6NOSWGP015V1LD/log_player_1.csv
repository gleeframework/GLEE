"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take a smaller share to get us started.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me taking $6,000 and Bob taking $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your fairness in the first round, but I think we can do better for both of us. This offer gives us both a larger share, and we can get this game over with quickly. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I need to reassess the offer. Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, the actual amounts are:

Alice's gain: 4000 * 0.9 = 3600
Bob's gain: 6000

I'm not sure if this is the best offer, so I'll reject it for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, the total amount is now $9,000 (10,000 * 0.9).

Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think this is a fair split considering the reduced value of the money.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, with me taking $5,500 and Bob taking $4,500."
