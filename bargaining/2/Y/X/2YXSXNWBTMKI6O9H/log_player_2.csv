"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. Take $1000, and I'll take $9000.  We can negotiate further if you want. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible offer for me! While Alice doesn't lose any value from the money in future rounds, I do. It's better to negotiate for a fairer split, even if it means losing some value to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""That offer was way off. How about a more realistic split? 60/40 seems fair considering the circumstances.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's compromise. I'll take $7000, and you can have $3000.  It's still a better deal for you than last round, and we're getting closer to a fair split. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice is trying to take advantage of my position, but it's still not a good deal for me. I need to hold out for a better split, even if it means risking getting a lower amount due to inflation in the later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""This is getting us nowhere.  A 50/50 split is the only fair option.  Let's just end this and both get something.""
