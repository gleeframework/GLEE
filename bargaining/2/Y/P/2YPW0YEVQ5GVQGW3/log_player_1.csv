"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a good compromise""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I'll take 400,000 and Bob will take 600,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will agree to it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable. I'm willing to give you a decent share, but I need more to make it worth my while considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with the 75-25 split, especially considering the inflation. I was hoping for a more even split. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise further, but I need a better deal considering the inflation""}

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than the previous offers. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and accept it."
