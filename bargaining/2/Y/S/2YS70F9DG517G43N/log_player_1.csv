"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Let's start with a reasonable offer. I take a bit more considering the inflation.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your turn to be reasonable. This is a slight improvement on your offer, but we need to find a middle ground quickly with the inflation ticking. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a tough one! Bob is right, we need to find a middle ground quickly.  While not ideal, getting something is better than nothing if we run out of rounds.
