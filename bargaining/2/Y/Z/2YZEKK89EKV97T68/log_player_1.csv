"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, I'll get a bit more to start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split in my favor is fairer, since I get to propose this time.  Let's get this over with. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 10% inflation, my potential gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so I'd be getting $5,400 if I accepted this offer.

I'm not thrilled about the 60-40 split in Bob's favor, but I'm not eager to go to Round 3 either. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
