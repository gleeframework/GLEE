"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you $1000 and take the rest.""
}
```

This offer gives me 90% of the initial amount, which is a relatively fair share considering the inflation rate. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game early!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent chunk, but I'm not going to give it all away yet! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rate affecting my gain, I need to be more cautious. Considering Bob's offer, I'll think it over.

I'll decide to reject this offer and wait for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more this round, but I'm not going to let you have all the power. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a decent share and keeping a significant portion for myself, considering the inflation rate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share this round. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rate affecting my gain even more significantly, I need to be even more cautious. Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a fair compromise, and I'm willing to accept it.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
