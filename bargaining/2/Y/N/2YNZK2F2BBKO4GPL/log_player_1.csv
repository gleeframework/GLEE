"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""I'll take it all, no negotiation!""
}
```

This is a bold move, but I'm hoping Bob will see the value in accepting this offer and ending the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a division of $72 for myself and $28 for you. Let's work together to make this fair. 
# Alice gain: 28 
# Bob gain: 72 
Do you accept this offer?","A more reasonable offer from Bob this time!

I'll think for a moment... I'm not sure I'm willing to give up 44 dollars, but 28 dollars is a decent compromise. Let's see...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Time to make a new proposal!

Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher share for myself this time. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""A fair share, considering the inflation""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
