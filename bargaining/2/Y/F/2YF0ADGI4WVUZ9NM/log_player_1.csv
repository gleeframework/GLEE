"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 

I'm going for a classic 90/10 split.  This seems like a good starting point to see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is worse than my initial proposal, even after accounting for inflation. I'll reject and see if he's willing to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I'm going to reduce my share slightly to 85, but still offer more than Bob's proposal. I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to negotiate while still prioritizing a decent payout for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even though Bob's offer has increased, it's still less than my previous offer, and the inflation has significantly impacted his share. I'm going to continue to reject and see if he's willing to meet me halfway."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm going to lower my proposed share again to 80, hoping this will show Bob I'm serious about reaching an agreement. The inflation is starting to become a real factor, so I need to find a middle ground soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much worse than my previous proposal, and inflation has significantly impacted his share. I'm still going to reject his offer and see if he's willing to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}
```

I'm going to lower my proposed share to 75, as inflation is making it difficult to get a higher share. I hope this shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a reasonable amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is finally at least somewhat fair, and inflation is really hurting his share.  While 50/50 isn't ideal, it's better than getting nothing at this point."
