"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you a decent amount to get us going.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. I'm hoping this is a good starting point for our negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll start with a slightly higher offer, let's see if we can meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money has decreased due to inflation!

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept this offer. I'd like to propose a new offer that takes into account the decreased value of money due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, my gain is now worth 64% of what it was in the first round (80% of 80% = 64%). I'll take that into account in my new offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5120,
  ""bob_gain"": 4880,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to give you a larger share. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```"
