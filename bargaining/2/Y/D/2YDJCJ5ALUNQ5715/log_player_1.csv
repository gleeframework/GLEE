Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was heavily skewed in your favor. Let's be realistic, this split accounts for the inflation but is still fair for both of us.

# Bob gain: 60

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the only fair option at this point.  The value is decreasing significantly for you each round, and we both lose if we fail to reach an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a tough decision, but accepting is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:** The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me with each round. Waiting any longer will only result in a worse outcome. 
* **Bob's Stance:** Bob has indicated this is his final offer. There's a high probability he will not budge from the 50/50 split.
* **Guaranteed Loss:**  If I reject, and we fail to reach an agreement, we both walk away with nothing.

While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage limits further losses and guarantees I receive something."
