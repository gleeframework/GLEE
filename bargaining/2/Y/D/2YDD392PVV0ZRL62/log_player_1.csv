Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose to keep 6000$ for myself and give 4000$ to Bob. I believe this is a fair starting offer, considering the inflation difference."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5400, ""bob_gain"": 4600}

I propose keeping 5400$ for myself and giving 4600$ to Bob.  This takes into account the inflation, and is a more balanced offer than the last round."
