"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, 60-40 in my favor""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $10,000 and leaving 40% for Bob. I'm framing it as a fair split, but I'm actually trying to get a bit more for myself to start with!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about taking only 20% of the remaining amount, but I'm also not eager to risk going to the next round and seeing the money's value decrease further.

I'll accept this offer for now.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
