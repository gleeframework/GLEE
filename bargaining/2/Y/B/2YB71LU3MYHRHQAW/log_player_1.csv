"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. What do you say, Bob?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob wants a bit more of the pie.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a big jump from 50-50 to 60-40. I'm not willing to give you such a large majority. Let's try to find a more balanced split.""
}
```

I'm not accepting Bob's offer, and I'm hoping he'll come back with something more reasonable in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think 55-45 is a more reasonable compromise. What do you think, Bob?""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground between the 50-50 split I initially proposed and the 60-40 split Bob wanted."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not satisfied with the split, but I'm willing to make a slightly more generous offer 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is still pushing for a larger share.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Your offer is getting closer to what I'm willing to accept, but 65-35 is still a bit too skewed in your favor. I'm not willing to give up that much more. Let's try to find a more balanced split.""
}
```

I'm not accepting Bob's offer, and I'm hoping he'll come back with something more reasonable in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think 42-58 is a fairer split. What do you think, Bob?""
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise that's closer to the 50-50 split I initially proposed, but still gives Bob a slightly larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting desperate, but I'm willing to make one more concession 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is getting a bit more aggressive with his offers.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to give up that much more. 70-30 is not a fair split, and I'm starting to think you're not serious about finding a compromise. Let's try to find a more balanced split.""
}
```

I'm not accepting Bob's offer, and I'm starting to get a bit skeptical about his intentions."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.

  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and go back to the 40-60 split we discussed earlier. I think this is a fair and reasonable offer. Let's take it or leave it.""
}
```

I'm trying to go back to a split that we've discussed before, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it this time."
