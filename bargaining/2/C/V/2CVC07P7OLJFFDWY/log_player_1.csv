"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the money, which I think is a reasonable starting point. I'm attaching a friendly message to encourage him to accept the offer. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a larger share, but this division is more reflective of the decreasing value over time. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5800,
  ""bob_gain"": 4200,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, this is a more reasonable split""
}
```

I've reduced my initial offer slightly to take into account the decreasing value of the money for Bob, but I still think I should get a larger share since the money is worth the same to me. Let's see if Bob agrees!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be realistic.  This offer provides a slight advantage to me considering the inflation, but it's far better than both of us losing everything in later rounds. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5700,
  ""bob_gain"": 4300,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a larger share""
}
```

I've reduced my offer again to try to meet Bob halfway, but I'm still not willing to give up too much. The inflation is affecting Bob's share, not mine, so I think I should still get a larger portion of the money. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  We're running out of time, and the longer we wait the less we both get. I'm proposing a perfectly even split. Let's be done with this! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5600,
  ""bob_gain"": 4400,
  ""message"": ""Even split is not fair given the inflation, I'm willing to compromise but I still want a larger share""
}
```

I'm still not willing to give up on getting a larger share, especially since the inflation is only affecting Bob's portion. I'm making a slightly more generous offer than before, but I think I can still get a better deal. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
