"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a very lopsided offer, knowing that the money will depreciate for me in the next round. Let's see if Bob bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though I'm getting a tiny amount, it's better than getting nothing in the next round. This offer is a good deal for me considering the inflation!"
