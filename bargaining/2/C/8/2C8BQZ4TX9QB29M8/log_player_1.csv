"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI'm offering to take $55 and give Bob $45. I've included a message to Bob suggesting that this is a reasonable split. Let me know how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you wanting a larger share, but this split is more reflective of the decreasing value over time. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not satisfied with Bob's offer. Given that the money is worth 20% less to me in this round, I'm not willing to accept a smaller share than what I initially proposed. I'll reject the offer and make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll take into account the decreasing value of the money for both of us. Since the money is worth 20% less to me and 5% less to Bob compared to the first round, and another 20% less to me and 5% less to Bob compared to the second round, I'll adjust my proposal accordingly.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I believe this is a more fair split now""}\n\nI'm offering to take $60 and give Bob $40. I've included a message explaining that I've considered the effects of inflation on the value of the money and believe this split is more fair. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This offer ensures we both lose the least amount to inflation. Let's end this fairly. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll calculate the actual value of the money for both of us considering the inflation.

For me, the money is worth 48.8% less, so the actual value of my gain would be $50 * (1 - 0.488) = $25.60.
For Bob, the money is worth 14.26% less, so the actual value of his gain would be $50 * (1 - 0.1426) = $42.87.

Given that I initially proposed a 55-45 split and considering the significant decrease in value for me, I'll accept this offer to minimize further losses.

{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI'm accepting Bob's offer of a 50-50 split to end the game."
