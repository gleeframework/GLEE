"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. With the inflation, my gain of 4000 is worth 95% of the original amount, so it's actually 3800. But I still have to decide whether to accept or reject.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 5% less after the second round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my proposal for round 3:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me calculate the value of my potential gain in round 4, taking into account the cumulative inflation.

The original $10,000 is now worth 85.74% of its original value (1 - 0.1426). My gain of 3500 in this round would be worth 85.74% of $3500, which is approximately $3003.

Considering this, I'll decide:

{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}"
