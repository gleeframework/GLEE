"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal Bob. I take $60, you take $40. It's a fair offer considering the time pressure. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55/45 is a better split, given the time pressure. What do you say?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, the clock is ticking. This is my final offer - take it or leave it! 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a better split, the time pressure and the fact that Alice's offer is essentially the same as the first round, even with the inflation, makes it the safer choice. It's better to get something than risk getting nothing."
