"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm inviting Bob to respond with his proposal for Round 2."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer. You can still get a good chunk! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the $400,000 I'd get is actually worth 80% of $500,000, which is $400,000. Not bad!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully. Since I'm not getting a 50/50 split, I'd rather get a better deal. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect, the money is worth 64% of what it was in the first round, so I'll aim for a higher percentage of the remaining amount.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give up too much. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm hoping this offer is more appealing to Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much either. You can't have it all! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the $450,000 I'd get is actually worth 57.6% of $500,000, which is $288,000 in the first round's value, but only $288,000 / 0.648 = $443,379.37 in the current round's value. I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Since I'm not getting a better deal than in Round 3, and I'm not sure what Bob's inflation rate is, I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect, the money is worth 40.96% of what it was in the first round. I'll aim for a higher percentage of the remaining amount.

Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not going to give up yet. I'll try to get a better deal this time!""
}
```

I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of. You're getting closer, but not close enough! 
# Alice gain: 380000 
# Bob gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the $380,000 I'd get is actually worth 38.4% of $500,000, which is $192,000 in the first round's value, but only $192,000 / 0.6723 = $284,519.65 in the current round's value.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not getting a significantly better deal than in Round 5, and I'm not sure if I'm getting the best possible deal. I'll reject this offer.

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect, the money is worth 33.65% of what it was in the first round. I'll aim for a higher percentage of the remaining amount.
