"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

This is a 50-50 split, which seems fair to start with."

# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about it...

I'll reject this offer. I'd rather wait for a better deal. My gain is still worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 5% less. I'll try to get a better split.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the previous offer from Bob, I'll make a new proposal that takes into account the decreasing value of the money due to inflation.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the decreasing value of the money, I'll make a new proposal that takes into account the increasing difference in the value of the money between Bob and me.
