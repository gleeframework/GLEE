Round 2

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. It's round 3, and inflation is hurting us both. A 50/50 split is the fairest and quickest way to end this. Take it before it's worth even less! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000
