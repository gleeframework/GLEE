"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair split that gives me the majority, but still leaves you with a significant share. Let's get this done quickly! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While Alice's offer is technically ""significant"", it's highly unfavorable to Bob. It's worth exploring if a more equitable split is possible, even if it takes a few rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
