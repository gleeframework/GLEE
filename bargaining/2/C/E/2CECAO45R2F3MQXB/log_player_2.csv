"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60/40. It's a good deal for both of us in the first round. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's tempting to take a quick 40, but I think I can do better if I wait and see what Alice proposes next.  The money depreciates with each round, but I'll be the one making the offer next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's flip the script.  60/40 in my favor this time. It's a fair trade for rejecting your offer last round.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you want a larger share, but 60/40 is too much. How about we meet in the middle at 55/45? 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I would prefer 60, the value of the money is decreasing with each round. It's better to take a slightly smaller share now than risk getting nothing at all in later rounds."
