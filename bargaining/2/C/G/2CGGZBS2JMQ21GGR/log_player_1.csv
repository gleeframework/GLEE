Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be realistic. I'm proposing a counter-offer that reflects the time value of money. It's still a fair split, with a slight advantage for me since I'm taking on the risk in this round. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
