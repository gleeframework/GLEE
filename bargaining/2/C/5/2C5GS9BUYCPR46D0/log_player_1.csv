"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, no need to negotiate too hard.""
}
```

This is a very straightforward offer, with each of us getting $50. I'm hoping Bob will accept this and we can avoid wasting time negotiating."
