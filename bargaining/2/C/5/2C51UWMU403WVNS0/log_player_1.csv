"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, see what happens next.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, to set a baseline for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted 50/50, I'll give you a bit less and keep more for myself. Your turn to decide! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

I don't want to give up too much, but I also don't want to risk going into further rounds with even less value. Considering the inflation, the offer is actually quite generous from Bob's perspective. I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer, I'll make a new proposal that tries to account for the decreasing value of money. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""You kept more in the last round, I'll try to balance it out this time.""
}
```"
