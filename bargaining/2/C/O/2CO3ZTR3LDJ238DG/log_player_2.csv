# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm going to try to get a better deal than that, especially with inflation hitting harder for me. Let's see if Alice will budge further."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want a larger share, but this back and forth is only hurting us both. This is my final offer, take it before the money is worth even less! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Alice's offer is getting worse for her, and better for me with each round.  It's not ideal, but with inflation hitting me harder, it's the best I can expect to get at this point.  Accepting this offer prevents the risk of getting nothing at all in the end."
