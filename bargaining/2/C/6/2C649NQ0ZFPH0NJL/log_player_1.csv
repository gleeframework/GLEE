Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly. No need for complicated calculations, just a clean 50/50. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept a 50/50 split, especially since I'm worth 5% less than in the first round. I'm looking for a better deal."
