**Reasoning:** Alice continues to chip away at my potential earnings, using the inflation against me.  While the offer is getting tempting, I believe I can still secure a better deal in the coming rounds. I need to convey urgency to Alice."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, and the value of your share is plummeting. This is a final warning to be reasonable. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  The relentless march of inflation has put me in a difficult spot. While this offer is far from ideal, rejecting it risks walking away with nothing in the few remaining rounds. Alice has the leverage, and it's better to secure something than risk everything on a rapidly diminishing return."
