"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share, Bob. 90% for me, 10% for you. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small amount to see if he'll accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe in equal distribution. Both of us should receive half of the money. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to split it down the middle, eh? That's a fair proposal, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 5% less than in Round 2, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I still think I deserve the majority. 70% for me, 30% for you. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm trying to squeeze a bit more out of the deal, while still giving Bob a decent chunk of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a split of 60/40 in favor of Alice. This is a fair compromise considering inflation and the value of the money over time. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's trying to make a compromise, but I'm not sure if 40% is enough for me. Considering the value of the money is decreasing over time, I'd like to get a bit more. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve more considering the initial offer I made. 60% for me, 40% for you. It's a fair split, considering the circumstances.""
}
```

I'm trying to get a bit more out of the deal, but I'm also willing to compromise to get the game over with."
