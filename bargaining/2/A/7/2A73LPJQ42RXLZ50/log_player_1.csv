"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a proposal that gives me a large share of the money, but still leaves a small amount for Bob.  I want to see if he'll accept a deal that seems unfair, or if he'll risk the chance of getting nothing at all by going to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 800000 
# Bob gain: 200000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's a lot more than what he offered me in the first round, it's still not a fair split.  I'm going to see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000} 
```

I'm going to offer Bob a slightly smaller share than he offered me, but still a significant amount.  I'm hoping that he'll see that it's better to take what he can get now, rather than risk getting nothing at all in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting more reasonable, but I'm still going to reject it. Inflation is hitting hard, but I believe I can get a better deal in the next round.  I'm going to see if I can negotiate a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000} 
```

I'm going to try offering Bob a slightly higher amount than my previous offer. I'm hoping this will demonstrate my willingness to compromise and get us closer to a deal. Inflation is making the money worth less with each round, so I'm trying to reach a point where both of us get something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 650000 
# Bob gain: 350000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting more favorable, it's still not quite fair considering the drastic effects of inflation on both of us. I need to push for a more balanced split before time runs out."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

I'm raising my offer to Bob again. With each round, the value of the money decreases, so I'm trying to find a compromise that benefits both of us before it's too late. I hope this offer will convince Bob to accept and avoid further losses due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

This offer from Bob is more equitable than previous rounds, and the value of the money is declining rapidly. I'll take it to avoid further losses."
