"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob! You won't get a better offer than this.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself. The message is a bit aggressive, but I'm trying to set the tone for the negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose an equal division of the funds. It seems fair given the uncertainty and risk involved. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Considering the inflation effect, I need to adjust my calculations. Since Bob's offer is for an equal division, I'll calculate my gain in the current round:

$500,000 is worth 90% of the original $700,000 I could have gotten in Round 1 (due to 10% less value due to inflation), so I'm effectively getting $630,000.

I'm not sure if Bob is getting a better deal, but I'm willing to take the risk. I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
