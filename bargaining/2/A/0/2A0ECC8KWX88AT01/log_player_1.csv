Bob's offer:

# Bob gain: 5000

This is a tough one, but at this point, accepting is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** With only 6 rounds left, the pressure is immense.  If we don't settle now, the chances of walking away with nothing increase dramatically.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  The 50/50 split might seem unfair given the inflation, but consider how much value I've already lost.  Waiting longer means even that 5000 will be worth significantly less.
* **Bob's Stance:** Bob's ""final offer"" language suggests he's unlikely to budge further. Holding out for a better deal is a huge gamble.

While it's frustrating to lose out due to the inflation mechanic, taking the guaranteed 5000 now is the most rational decision."
