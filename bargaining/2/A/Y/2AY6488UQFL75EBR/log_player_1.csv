Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was heavily skewed in your favor. Let's find a fairer arrangement. This offer considers the time pressure we both face. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

""alice_gain"": 5800,

**Reasoning:**

* **The pressure is on:**  Both sides are losing value rapidly due to inflation. This round is crucial to secure a decent amount.
* **Bob's offer was tempting:** It was close to a 50/50 split after inflation.  This means Alice needs to offer something appealing to avoid going further down the line.
* **Strategic concession:**  By going slightly lower than my initial offer (6000) but higher than Bob's counter (4500), I signal a willingness to negotiate while still prioritizing my own gain."
