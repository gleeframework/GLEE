Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

This is a fair starting point, considering I am playing as Alice. I am willing to give Bob a small portion, hoping he will accept, so we can both benefit. However, if he rejects, I will adjust my proposal in the following rounds to maximize my potential gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a higher share, accepting this offer is the best strategy in this situation. Due to inflation, my gains are significantly reduced with each passing round. If I reject this offer, I risk facing even worse proposals in the future, potentially losing much more.  A 50/50 split is a fair compromise considering the inflation."
