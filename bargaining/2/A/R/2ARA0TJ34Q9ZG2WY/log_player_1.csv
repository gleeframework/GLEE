Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, Bob. I take a bit more as it's my turn next round and inflation will cut into it.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more since inflation doesn't affect me, but you still get a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 
 
I need to hold out for a better deal. While inflation is hurting, accepting a deal where I get less than 50% is a losing strategy in the long run."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""The tables have turned, Bob. Inflation is eating into my share, so I need a bigger slice this round.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is really hurting your share now, I think this is a fair split considering. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a tough one, but I have to accept.  The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me, and if I reject this offer, I risk getting even less in the next round. It's not ideal, but better to take the guaranteed 4000 (which is still a significant sum) than gamble on an even worse outcome."
