"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a good deal!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40. I'm framing it as a fair split, hoping Bob will accept it and we can wrap up the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that! Let's be fair and split it closer to the middle. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth less due to inflation, I need to be more cautious.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think I can do better than 40$. I'll wait for Bob's next offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while!""
}
```

I'm proposing a slightly better split for myself, with me getting $45 and Bob getting $55. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
