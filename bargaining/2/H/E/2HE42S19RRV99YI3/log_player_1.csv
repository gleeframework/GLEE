Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can split the remaining 100,000 among ourselves!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping he'll accept and we can move on to the next round."

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000

# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation eating away at Bob's gain, I'm not sure if he's being serious about this being his final offer. I'll think carefully before making a decision.
