"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take $6,000 and you can take $4,000. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, but I'm leaving room for negotiation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but I'm willing to compromise. Your turn to decide! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gain staying the same value, I'd rather take a larger share now while I can. I'll accept Bob's offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
