"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a generous offer for Bob, hoping to secure a deal quickly. Since inflation is a factor, I don't want to risk waiting too long and potentially losing value on my share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I prefer a larger share, it's getting risky to keep rejecting offers. Bob's offer is fair and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all if we reach the final round."
