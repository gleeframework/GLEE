"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. It's a fair starting point, and I'm willing to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
I accept Bob's offer. A 50/50 split is fair, and I'm not sure if I'll get a better deal in the next round given the inflation."
