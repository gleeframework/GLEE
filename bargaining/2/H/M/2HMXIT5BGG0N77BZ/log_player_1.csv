  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can both walk away with a nice sum!""

Round 2

# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round. Since Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, I'll have to consider the reduced value of my share due to inflation.

Here's my response:
