"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

I'm offering a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the difference between our proposed gains is relatively small, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the ongoing inflation, I'll make a new offer with a slightly higher share for myself to account for the decreasing value of money. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```"
