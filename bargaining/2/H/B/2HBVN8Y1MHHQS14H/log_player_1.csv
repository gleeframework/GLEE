"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering Bob $4000, which is 40% of the total amount, and I'll take $6000, which is 60% of the total amount. I've included a message that says ""Let's divide fairly"" to convey that my offer is reasonable and fair. Since the money is worth 10% less to Bob in each subsequent round, he has an incentive to accept my offer now rather than risking a lower value in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. This offer is more equitable, and still gives you a decent share. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money is worth the same to me in this round as it was in the first round, I don't have an incentive to accept an offer that gives me less than my initial proposal. Additionally, Bob's offer of $4500 is less than what I initially offered myself ($6000), so I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round. I'll try to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth 10% less to Bob in each subsequent round, which may make him more willing to accept a future offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nNow it's my turn again! Here's my next proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Consider the inflation""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nSince I've already made my next proposal, I'll just repeat it here:

{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Consider the inflation""}

I'm offering Bob $4200, which is slightly less than my initial offer, but still a significant amount. I'm taking into account the fact that the money is worth 10% less to Bob in each subsequent round, so I'm trying to find a balance between being fair and taking advantage of the situation. My message ""Consider the inflation"" is a reminder to Bob that the value of the money is decreasing for him, and that it's in his best interest to accept my offer sooner rather than later."
