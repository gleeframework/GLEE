"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal, Bob. I take $60, you take $40. It's a fair offer considering the time pressure. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
I think I can do better than that, especially considering the money is going to be worth less each round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think this is a fairer split considering the value of the money will decrease each round. Let's get this done.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is ticking and the value is decreasing. I'll take $55, you take $45. Let's settle this now and both get something. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm still not happy with the split. I'll try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Alice, we're losing money with every round. This is the best deal we can get now, before the inflation hurts us too much. Accept this and we can move on.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  Let's split it down the middle and call it a day. 50/50, take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

With the inflation, it's getting risky to keep rejecting. 50/50 is a fair compromise given the situation."
