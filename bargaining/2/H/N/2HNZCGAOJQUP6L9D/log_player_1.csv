"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this over with! Take the whole thing, I'm not interested.""
}
```

This way, I'll get the whole $100, and Bob gets nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, let's split it evenly. 
# Alice gain: 25 
# Bob gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's offer is to split it evenly, I'll get $25, which is 25% of the original $100.

I'll accept this offer.
