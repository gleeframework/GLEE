"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. I'm framing it as a generous offer to try to get the game started quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slight adjustment to the previous offer. Still generous, but not as much. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing!

After considering Bob's offer, I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better. I'd like to see a more substantial adjustment to the previous offer."

  ""message"": ""A fair split, considering the decreasing value of money. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

I'm offering a more balanced split, taking into account the 20% decrease in value of the money I gain due to inflation."

```
{
