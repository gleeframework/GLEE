"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it quickly to avoid further rounds and the impact of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll have to be more cautious. Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, which is a fair offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll reject this offer to see if I can do better.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the 20% inflation, my offer needs to be adjusted accordingly. I'll aim for a slightly higher share to compensate for the loss in value. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is taking a toll on me! With the money I gain being worth only 51.2% of its original value, I need to be even more cautious. Bob's offer is a 45-55 split, which is not too far off from my previous offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll reject this offer to see if I can do better.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With the money I gain being worth 51.2% of its original value, I'll aim for a slightly higher share to compensate for the loss in value. Considering the previous offers and the inflation, I'll make a more aggressive offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200}"

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking its toll on me now! With the money I gain being worth only 32.77% of its original value, I'm getting desperate. Bob's offer is a 40-60 split, which is a relatively good offer considering the circumstances. I don't think I can do better, so I'll accept this offer.
