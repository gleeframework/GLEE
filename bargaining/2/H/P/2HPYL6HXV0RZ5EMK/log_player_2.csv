"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair split - 90% for me, 10% for you. Let's finish this quickly. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible deal for Bob! Alice is heavily exploiting Bob's lack of bargaining power in later rounds. Bob should hold out for a much fairer split, even if it means risking going to further rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a 60/40 split.  This reflects that my position strengthens over time, while yours weakens considerably. Don't let greed lead us to nothing.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still believe I deserve a larger share. I'm offering 70% for myself and 30% for you. Let's try to find a solution before the money dwindles further. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is still heavily favoring herself in this deal. While a 70/30 split is better than her initial offer, Bob's position will only continue to improve as the rounds progress due to the difference in inflation rates. It's worth risking another rejection to aim for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6500,
""alice_gain"": 3500,
""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking and both our positions are eroding.  I'm holding firm at 65/35 - it's a fair reflection of the reality that each round that passes makes this deal significantly worse for you.  Let's be smart and take this win-win before it's too late.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, the time is running out.  Let's be practical. I'm offering a 50/50 split. It's a fair deal considering the circumstances, and we can avoid losing everything.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

It's finally time to accept. A 50/50 split is a fair outcome considering the circumstances. 

While Bob was in a strong position to negotiate for a larger share, the rapidly increasing inflation for Alice means waiting any longer carries a significant risk of getting nothing at all. 

It's a good deal for both sides at this point -  it's better to secure a win now than risk losing it all for a slightly larger, but uncertain, future gain."
