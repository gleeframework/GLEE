"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to get the game started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You got a better offer, think twice! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'll consider Bob's offer carefully.

Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll calculate the effective gains as follows:

My gain: 4000 / 0.8 = 5000 (in terms of the original value)
Bob's gain: 6000 / 0.95 = 6315.79 (in terms of the original value)

Considering the offer, I think I can do better than this. I'll reject the offer and proceed to Round 3.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to take advantage of the inflation. Since the money is worth 20% less for me, I'll aim to get a larger share.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You got a better offer, think twice! ""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70/30 split, hoping to get a larger share before the value of the money continues to erode."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'm not! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation taking its toll, the money is worth significantly less for me. I'll calculate the effective gains as follows:

My gain: 4500 / 0.5192 = 8686.41 (in terms of the original value)
Bob's gain: 5500 / 0.85 = 64705.88 (in terms of the original value)

However, I'm not getting desperate just yet! I think I can still do better than this. The offer seems a bit too generous for Bob, and I'm not convinced he's not trying to manipulate the value of the money. I'll reject the offer and proceed to Round 5.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 5, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer, considering the continued inflation. Since the money is worth 48.8% less for me, I'll aim to get an even larger share.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8500,
  ""bob_gain"": 1500,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting any younger, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing an 85/15 split, hoping to get a significant portion of the remaining value before the money continues to erode."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're running out of time, think carefully! 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking its toll! In Round 6, I'll calculate the effective gains as follows:

My gain: 3500 / 0.3239 = 10817.94 (in terms of the original value)
Bob's gain: 6500 / 0.77 = 8430.52 (in terms of the original value)

Considering the offer, I'm not thrilled about the split, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of time. I'm not sure if I can do better, and Bob's message is making me think twice. I'll accept the offer, hoping it's the best I can get.
