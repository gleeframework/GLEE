"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split, hoping to get a good starting point and leave room for negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000}
```

I'm going to propose a more even split this time, aiming for 45/55. This offers Bob a slightly better share while still giving me a decent amount.  The inflation is starting to bite, so I need to be more aggressive with my proposal."
