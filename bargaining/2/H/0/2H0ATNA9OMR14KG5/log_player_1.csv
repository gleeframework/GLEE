"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'm willing to give you 300,000. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 7:3 split, which I think is a fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the upcoming inflation. Let's reach a deal. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money has decreased, and Bob is trying to take advantage of that!

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""A 60/40 split is too skewed in your favor, Bob. I'm willing to give you a better deal, but 60/40 is too aggressive.""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept Bob's offer. I'll wait for a better proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise and give you a 55/45 split. It's still a fair deal, don't you think?""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground and give Bob a slightly larger share, but still keep a significant portion for myself."
