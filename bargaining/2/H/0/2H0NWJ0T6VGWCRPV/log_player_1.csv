"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. We can always negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $10,000, leaving Bob with 40%. My message is a friendly opening offer, inviting Bob to consider a fair split and suggesting that we can negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the middle ground, but I'm not giving you the upper hand. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less for Bob, the offer is:

Alice gain: 5000
Bob gain: 4000

I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 2. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
