"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's get started!""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 10% less, I'll think about it in terms of the original amount. The offer is to split the money 50-50, which is a more even split than my initial offer.
