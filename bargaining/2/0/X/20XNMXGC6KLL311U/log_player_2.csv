"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's start with a reasonable offer. I take $60, you get $40.  It's important to reach an agreement quickly because of the inflation.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, the value of the money is decreasing with each round. Let's be practical. I'll take $55, you take $45. This ensures we both get a decent share before inflation eats away at it further. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
