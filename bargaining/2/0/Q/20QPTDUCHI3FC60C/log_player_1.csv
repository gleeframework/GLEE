"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

This way, I get 80% of the initial amount, and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With Bob's offer, I would gain 50% of the initial amount, which is still worth 50% of the initial amount, but the money I would gain in the next round would be worth 10% less than before.

I accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
