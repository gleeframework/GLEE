"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a good deal!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, but I'm willing to give Bob a decent share to start the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is a more fair starting point. It's a good deal for both of us! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 5% less, I'll consider the offer carefully.

I think a 55-45 split is a bit more favorable to Bob, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept this offer.
