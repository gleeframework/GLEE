"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's start with an even split.  We can adjust later if needed. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: Since the money is worth 5% less for me in each subsequent round, I should try to end the game as soon as possible to minimize the loss due to inflation. However, accepting an even split immediately might not be the best option, as I might be able to negotiate a better deal in the next rounds. I'll reject this offer and try to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, let's try to meet in the middle with a slight adjustment for my loss.""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: Given that the money is worth 5% less to me in each subsequent round, I need to balance between negotiating a good deal and ending the game quickly. Offering 52 to myself and 48 to Bob slightly adjusts for the inflation loss while still aiming for a relatively fair split. This also leaves room for further negotiation if Bob rejects this offer."
