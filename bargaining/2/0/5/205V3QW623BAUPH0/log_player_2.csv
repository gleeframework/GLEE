"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair division, considering we both have a chance to make an offer. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible offer! While it seems ""fair"" on the surface, Alice is using the time limit and inflation against me. I need to push for a much better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 7000,
""alice_gain"": 3000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. I'm feeling generous today, so I'll offer you 3000. Take it or leave it, but the clock is ticking, and the value is decreasing."" 
}
``` 

This offer is aggressive, which is necessary given the circumstances:

* **Time Pressure:** With only 11 rounds left, Alice needs to realize I'm serious and won't back down easily. 
* **Inflation:**  Delaying benefits Alice significantly more than me. My offer compensates for the risk I'm taking with each passing round.
* **Positioning:** Starting with a strong offer might make Alice more willing to accept a less favorable deal in later rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still believe a more equitable split is possible. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is trying to act reasonable, but this is still unacceptable.  She's simply trying to take advantage of the inflation working against me.  A 30/70 split in her favor is nowhere near a ""middle ground"" given the circumstances.  I need to hold firm and make it clear I'm serious about getting a fair share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Alice, time is running out, and the pot is shrinking. I'm offering you 4000 - a fair deal considering the circumstances.  Let's be smart and end this here."" 
}
```

Here's why this offer makes sense now:

* **Concession:** I've lowered my demand from 7000 to 6000, showing I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Urgency:** Highlighting the shrinking pot due to inflation adds pressure on Alice to accept a deal soon. 
* **Reasonableness:**  A 60/40 split, while still in my favor, feels more justifiable and might be enough to sway Alice, especially as the rounds progress and the potential gains decrease for both of us."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm trying to be flexible, but I still need to get a decent share.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This is getting frustrating. Alice is using the ""fairness"" and ""compromise"" cards, but her offer still heavily favors her.  A 45/55 split is not acceptable, especially with inflation eating away at my share.  She's betting I'll cave under pressure, but I need to stand my ground."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. I'm offering you the deal you just offered me, BUT reversed. This is beyond fair, and frankly, your stalling is just hurting both of us now. Accept this and let's move on."" 
}
```

My reasoning:

* **Mirroring:** By reflecting Alice's previous offer back at her, I'm highlighting the hypocrisy of her ""fairness"" argument. 
* **Strong Language:**  I'm dropping the pretense of being ""nice"" and expressing my frustration directly.  This emphasizes the urgency of the situation.
* **Final Offer Tactic:**  While not my final offer,  framing it as such might push Alice to accept. She might be worried I'll drastically reduce my offer in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but this needs to be fair. Let's find a solution that respects both of our needs. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I need to cut my losses. 

Alice is clearly very stubborn and is banking on me getting increasingly desperate as inflation eats into my potential gain. Holding out for a 55/45 split or better is probably not realistic given her behavior.  Accepting 4000 now is better than risking getting even less in later rounds, or even worse, walking away with nothing."
