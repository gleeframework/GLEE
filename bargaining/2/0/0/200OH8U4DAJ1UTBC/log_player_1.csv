"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle, a fair start to our negotiations""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. I'm framing it as a fair starting point, hoping to set a positive tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my thinking. With the new values, I'll get $5,000 (which is 5% less than the $5,250 I would have gotten in the previous round) and Bob will get $4,000 (which is 20% less than the $5,000 he would have gotten in the previous round).

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, as it seems a bit too close to the previous offer I made. I'll reject it for now and try to make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreased value of the money. I'll aim to get a bit more, since the money is worth less.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""A slight adjustment to account for the inflation, let's see if we can meet here""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give in a bit, but not too much, let's see if we can find common ground 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values:

My gain: 5200, which is 14.26% less than the $6,000 I would have gotten in the first round.
Bob's gain: 4800, which is 48.8% less than the $9,600 Bob would have gotten in the first round.

Considering the decreased values, I think Bob's offer is a bit more reasonable. I'll accept it.
