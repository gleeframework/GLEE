"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

This is a fairly generous offer, considering I'm getting a majority of the money, but it's still a decent split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 20% less, so I need to think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject this offer and wait for the next round.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","With the inflation effect, my gain is worth 20% less than in the previous round. Considering this, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This offer is a bit more skewed towards me, but I'm still leaving Bob with a decent share of the money."

# Bob gain: 60
