Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time, and the clock is working against both of us. This offer is a compromise. Let's be sensible and take it. 
# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting greedier with each round, knowing the inflation hurts me more. While time is running out, accepting this offer would mean losing a significant portion of the initial potential gain. I need to show firmness to make her see a more balanced deal is necessary."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 480000, ""alice_gain"": 520000, ""message"": ""Alice, time is precious and we both lose with every passing round. This offer is a reasonable compromise that acknowledges the impact of inflation on us both. Let's end this now and secure a fair outcome.""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Show willingness to negotiate:** Increasing the offer to $480,000 demonstrates a willingness to compromise and move towards Alice's desired range.
* **Emphasize shared loss:**  The message reiterates the impact of inflation on both players, encouraging Alice to settle before the value diminishes further. 
* **Maintain firmness:** While showing flexibility, the offer still aims for a balanced outcome, avoiding a significant disadvantage for Bob due to Alice's delaying tactics."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this back-and-forth is getting us nowhere. My offer is still on the table. Let's be pragmatic and end this before inflation eats away at our potential gains even more. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

The situation has become critical. While not ideal, Alice's offer is the best I'm likely to get at this point.  

* **Severe inflation impact:** With each round, my potential gain shrinks drastically. Accepting $420,000 now is significantly better than risking getting even less or nothing at all if we reach round 12.
* **Alice's stance:** Alice is sticking to her offer, indicating she's unlikely to budge much. Rejecting this might force her hand, but it's a dangerous gamble considering the rapidly diminishing returns.

It's painful to concede, but accepting this offer ensures I at least receive a substantial sum, even if it's less than initially hoped for."
