"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get a good start, Bob. Accept this and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. I'm trying to be generous, but not too generous, to see if Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it fairly, Alice. Your turn to decide. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less in the second round, I'll consider the actual amounts I'd gain:

* Alice gain: 4000 / 0.95 = 4210.53 (approximately)
* Bob gain: 6000 (no change)

I don't think this is a good deal for me, considering the inflation. I'd rather wait for a better offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less than in the second round, I'll make a new offer. I'll propose a smaller amount for myself to account for the inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3000,
  ""bob_gain"": 7000,
  ""message"": ""I'll be reasonable, Bob. Accept this and we can move on.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent share, Alice. Don't expect more. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts I'd gain in Round 4, considering the 14.26% inflation:

* Alice gain: 4500 / 0.8526 (1 - 0.1426) = 5273.17 (approximately)
* Bob gain: 5500 (no change)

This offer is still not very appealing to me, considering the inflation. I'd rather wait for a better deal.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I'll make a new offer, taking into account the increased inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 2500,
  ""bob_gain"": 7500,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit desperate, Bob. Accept this and we can wrap it up.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: It's time to be serious, Alice. 50/50 is the best you'll get. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts I'd gain in Round 6, considering the 22.62% inflation:

* Alice gain: 5000 / 0.7722 (1 - 0.2262) = 6481.93 (approximately)
* Bob gain: 5000 (no change)

This 50/50 split is a decent offer, considering the inflation. I'm not sure if I'll get a better deal later, so I'll accept it.
