"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split the money 9000 for me and 1000 for you. It's a fair deal considering the inflation rate. You get something, and I get the majority. Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
