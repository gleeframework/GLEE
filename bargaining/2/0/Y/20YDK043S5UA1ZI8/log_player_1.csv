"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, a good starting point""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I would get $6,000 and Bob would get $4,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, as it's a relatively even split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, no need to negotiate 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 50-50 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'm not as motivated to negotiate as much as I was in the first round.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
