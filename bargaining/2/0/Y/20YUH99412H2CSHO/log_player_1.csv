"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $40 and keep $60 for myself. The message ""Let's be fair"" is a way to frame the offer as a reasonable and equitable split, in the hopes that Bob will accept it and we can conclude the game quickly.\n\nYour turn! How will Bob respond?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we should split the money evenly, what do you think? 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer because I think I can get a better deal. Since I initially offered Bob $40 and he rejected it, I'm not willing to accept the same amount now. I'll try to negotiate for a better split in the next round.\n\nYour turn! What's the next offer?"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $45 and keep $55 for myself. The message ""Meet me in the middle"" is an attempt to compromise and find a mutually acceptable solution. By giving up a bit from my initial offer, I'm hoping to entice Bob to accept this deal and end the game.\n\nYour turn! How will Bob respond?"
