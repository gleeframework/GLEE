"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 55/45, it's more fair this way 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

""alice_gain"": 5500,

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You've had your chance, now it's my turn! 60/40 is the new deal 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

While the situation is getting worse due to inflation, accepting this offer would mean I get even less than Bob's initial (and unfair) offer in Round 1. It's a gamble, but I'm hoping Bob will become more reasonable as the game progresses."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be real. Inflation is killing me.  I'm offering a fair 50/50 split.  Take it or leave it!""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to play hardball.  Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the situation. Offering a 50/50 split highlights the fairness for both sides.  It's a strong stance to take before inflation further diminishes my potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is on my side, I'll take the bigger share 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision, but time is literally money in this scenario. Bob is playing hardball, and with each round, the inflation eats further into my potential gains. While 3000 is much lower than I'd like, it's better to take this offer than risk getting even less in future rounds. If I reject this offer, there's a good chance I'll be forced to accept an even lower amount later."
