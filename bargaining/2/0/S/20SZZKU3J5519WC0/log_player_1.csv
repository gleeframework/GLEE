"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm offering you $2,000, and I'll take the remaining $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this new offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'll reject this offer. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With the inflation, my $8,000 from the first round is now worth $7,600, and my $2,000 from the first round is now worth $1,900. I'll take that into account for my new offer.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my $8,000 from the first round is now worth $6,800, and my $2,000 from the first round is now worth $1,760.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. If I accept, I'll get $5,000, which is less than my current offer of $7,600. But if I reject, the money will continue to lose value.

After considering this, I'll...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer."
