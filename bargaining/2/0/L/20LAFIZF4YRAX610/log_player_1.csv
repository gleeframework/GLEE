"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a different split. I'll take 45% and you can have 55%. This might not be perfect, but it's a fairer distribution than the previous offer. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
