"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'm willing to give you 400k, now let's negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, Alice. Let's see if you're willing to meet me in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not sure if I want to meet Bob in the middle, considering I was initially offered 400k and now he's offering 450k. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 81% of what it was in the first round (90% of 90% = 81%).

I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time, considering the value of my gain is decreasing.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to meet you in the middle, Bob. I'm offering you 460k, but I'm still holding out for a better deal.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up yet, Alice. I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm not going to give you the whole pie. Let's see if you'll take it. 
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is catching up with me!

With the inflation, my gain is now worth 72.9% of what it was in the first round (100% - 27.1% = 72.9%).

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, considering the value of my gain is decreasing rapidly. However, 520k is a relatively good offer, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with an even lower value.
