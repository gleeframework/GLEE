"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further""
}
```

I'm making a straightforward offer to split the $1,000,000 equally between us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm not willing to go much higher 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

Considering Bob's offer, I think I can do better than 400,000. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 90% of what it was in Round 1, so I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not going to give you all the money""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly higher share, but still keeping a decent chunk for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much 
# Alice gain: 380000 
# Bob gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 72.9% of what it was in the first round, so I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

Considering Bob's offer, I think 380,000 is a bit too low for me. I'd like to try to get a better deal.

  ""alice_gain"": 400000,

I'm making a similar offer to the one I made in Round 3, but with a slight adjustment to account for the further inflation."
