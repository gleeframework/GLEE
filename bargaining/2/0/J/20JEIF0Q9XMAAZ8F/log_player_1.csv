"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm offering Bob 300,000 dollars, which is a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept to get something rather than risking going to the next round where the money will be worth even less for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'm not thrilled about giving up 600,000 dollars, but I think I have to consider the decreasing value of money with each round. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less this round, I'll have to think carefully about the opportunity cost of rejecting this offer.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
