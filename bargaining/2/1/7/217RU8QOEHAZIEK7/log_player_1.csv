"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a quick agreement and minimize the impact of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, Bob's offer is fair and I don't want to risk losing even more due to inflation."
