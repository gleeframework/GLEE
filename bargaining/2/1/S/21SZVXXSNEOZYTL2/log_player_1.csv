"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split the money 60/40. This is a fair starting point, and it gives us both a good share of the pie. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
