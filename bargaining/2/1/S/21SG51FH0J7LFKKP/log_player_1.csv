"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a decent share, don't be greedy!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is 10% of the original amount, and keeping $900,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a fair share, let's end this! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth 20% less now!

I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can do better than 40% of the remaining amount. I'll wait for the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth 40% less now!

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly better deal, but I'm still keeping a slight edge."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I think it's fair! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is really losing value fast!

I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting this offer because I don't want to risk losing even more value with each passing round. $300,000 is a decent amount, and I'm willing to take it to end the game."
