"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. Fair is fair! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better offer. Since the money is worth 5% less for me with each passing round, I'm willing to take the risk to potentially get more than half. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'll take a bit more, considering the inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, Bob, but I'm not going to let inflation completely dictate the terms. Let's make a fair deal. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer as well. Even though the money is worth 9.75% less for me now, I'm still hoping to get a better deal in the next round. Alice is trying to make a fair deal, but I think I can push for a bit more. Let's proceed to the next round!###"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering the increasing inflation, I need a bit more to make it worthwhile.""}###"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, the inflation is affecting you more than me, but I'm not going to take advantage of that. Let's settle on a compromise that's fair for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on my gain, I think it's wise to accept this offer. The compromise seems fair, and I'm not sure if I can get a better deal in the next round. The money is worth 18.55% less for me now, so it's better to settle for 45 rather than risking further devaluation. Let's end the game here!###"
