Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think we can both do better. Let's split the money equally, taking inflation into account, so we both get a fair share. I'm proposing 5500 for me and 4500 for you. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
