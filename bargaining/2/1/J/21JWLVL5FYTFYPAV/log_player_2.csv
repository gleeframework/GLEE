Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, Bob. A 50/50 split seems fair, but since I'm offering, I'll take a slight advantage due to the inflation affecting me.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems we both want a larger share of the pie. Let's stop wasting time with the back and forth. I propose a straight 50/50 split. This is the fairest deal considering the inflation working against me. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000
