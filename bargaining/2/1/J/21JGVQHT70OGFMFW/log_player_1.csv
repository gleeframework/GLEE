"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, Alice proposes to take $600,000 for herself and give $400,000 to Bob, with a message suggesting this is a fair division. The total amount proposed is $1,000,000, adhering to the rules of the game. The message is brief and attempts to persuade Bob by framing the offer as fair, despite Alice taking a larger share. This strategy aims to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness while also maximizing Alice's gain, considering the potential for negotiation and the looming threat of inflation reducing the value of the money in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair. We can both get more this way. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlice rejects Bob's offer because, despite the adjusted values due to inflation, the proposed split of 55/45 in favor of Bob still doesn't align with Alice's initial perception of a fair division. By rejecting, Alice aims to negotiate further, hoping to find a more favorable split in subsequent rounds, albeit with the risk of further devaluation of the money. The strategy here is to hold out for a better offer, considering that accepting too early might result in a less optimal outcome for Alice."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 570000, ""bob_gain"": 430000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet closer to the middle""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, Alice adjusts her proposal to take slightly less than initially offered, attempting to find a middle ground that might be more acceptable to Bob, especially considering the devaluation of money due to inflation. The message acknowledges the impact of inflation and suggests a compromise, aiming to persuade Bob that this division is more reasonable and beneficial for both, given the circumstances. By doing so, Alice aims to conclude the negotiation sooner rather than later to minimize further losses due to inflation."
