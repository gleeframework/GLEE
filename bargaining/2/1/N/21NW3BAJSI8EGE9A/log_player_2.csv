"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The longer this goes on, the less value the money holds for me. A 50/50 split is the only fair outcome now. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000
