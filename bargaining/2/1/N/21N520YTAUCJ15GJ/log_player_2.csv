"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, Bob! 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

It's a bit too early to accept such a lopsided offer.  I'll see what Alice offers next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, Alice.  A 50/50 split seems like the most reasonable way to start.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. How about this? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

Alice's offer is still quite lopsided, and I'm not yet convinced she's willing to negotiate fairly. I'll see what she offers next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's split it 45/55, considering the inflation we're both facing.""}
