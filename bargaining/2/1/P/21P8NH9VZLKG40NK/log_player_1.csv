"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started with a fair split, Bob. 90% for me, 10% for you. We can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping to leave room for future negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bigger share, but not that big. You can do better than that. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth less due to inflation, I need to adjust my strategy.

I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not convinced this is a good deal for me. I'll hold out for a better offer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth even less due to inflation, I need to be more aggressive in my offer. Here's my next proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair deal considering the inflation. Take it or leave it.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you in the middle, but I'm not sure I'll go any lower than this. 
# Alice gain: 6500 
# Bob gain: 3500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth even less due to inflation, I need to think carefully about this offer. Considering the offer is to meet me in the middle, I'll consider it a good opportunity to get a decent share. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, I'll take the middle ground. It's a fair deal, considering the inflation.""
}
```"
