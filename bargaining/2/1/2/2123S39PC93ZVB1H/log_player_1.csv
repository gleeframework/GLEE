"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $30 and keeping $70 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a 50/50 split. It's fair and we both get something. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation, my $50 would be worth $40 in real value, and with the 5% inflation, Bob's $50 would be worth $47.50 in real value.

Considering this, I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
