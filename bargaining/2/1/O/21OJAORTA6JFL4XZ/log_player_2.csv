"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. Take this dollar and be happy. You know how inflation works... ðŸ˜‰ 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than that. Let's split it 90/10, I'll take the bigger share this time, and you get a decent cut. What do you say?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I'll play your game. 90/10, but this time I take the bigger share. Let's see if you're really as confident as you seem. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer to get 900,000, the inflation is hitting me hard. Accepting this offer will at least secure some gain, even if it's significantly less than what I initially wanted."
