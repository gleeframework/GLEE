"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

This is a generous offer, as I'm giving Bob a significant portion of the money to start. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation taking effect, my share is now worth 5% less, and Bob's share is worth 10% less than the initial amount. Considering the drastic reduction in my share, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject this offer for now.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the inflation effect, my share is worth even less now. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive in this round, taking a larger share of the remaining money. Let's see if Bob accepts this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my share! With the money worth 14.26% less than the initial amount, I need to be cautious.

Considering Bob's offer, I think I'll take it. The difference between our shares is relatively small, and I don't want to risk waiting for a better offer that might not come.
