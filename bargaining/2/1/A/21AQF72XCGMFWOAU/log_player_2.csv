Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your offer wasn't fair considering the inflation.  I'm proposing 55/45. This is a reasonable compromise, and we should take it before the money loses more value. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
