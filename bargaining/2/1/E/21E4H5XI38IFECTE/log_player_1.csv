"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'm offering you $100,000. Accept and we can shake on it.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll meet you in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to negotiate!

I'll think for a moment...

I'll reject this offer. I was hoping to get a bit more than half, and Bob's offer is a bit too generous considering he's trying to meet me ""in the middle"". I'll try to get a better deal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting closer, but I'm not quite there yet! I'll meet you at 55/45, but don't expect me to go any lower.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and not giving away too much. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll try to meet you at 55/45, but I'll take a bit more 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to adjust his offer to meet me at 55/45, but he's still trying to get a bit more.

Considering the inflation, Bob's offer is actually worth less than my original offer in Round 3, so I'm not too concerned about giving up a bit more.

I'll accept this offer.
