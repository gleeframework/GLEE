"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 

I'm offering a 90/10 split in my favor, knowing that the money will be worth less to Bob in the next round.  Let's see if he takes it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer. While it seems fair on the surface, Bob is taking advantage of the inflation to offer me less than what he initially proposed. I'll see what he comes up with in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm going to offer a 80/20 split in my favor again.  The inflation is working against Bob now, so I'm going to see if I can get a better deal this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  Even though inflation is working against him, he's still offering me a decent amount, and if I reject it, I risk getting even less in the next round. It's time to take the win!"
