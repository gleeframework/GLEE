Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to offer Bob a small portion of the money, hoping he'll accept it in the first round.  This way, I get most of the money before inflation kicks in.  Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, the inflation is starting to bite, and a 50/50 split is better than getting less due to the diminishing value of the money.  I'll accept this offer."
