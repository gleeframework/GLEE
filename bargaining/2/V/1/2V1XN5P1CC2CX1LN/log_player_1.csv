Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: Since you are feeling the effects of inflation more strongly, I am willing to give you a slight advantage this round.  I believe a fair split with a slight benefit for you will be more beneficial in the long run, rather than continuing to haggle and lose more value to inflation.
