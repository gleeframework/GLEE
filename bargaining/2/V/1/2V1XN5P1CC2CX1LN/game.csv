475000.0,525000.0,"Since you are feeling the effects of inflation more strongly, I am willing to give you a slight advantage this round.  I believe a fair split with a slight benefit for you will be more beneficial in the long run, rather than continuing to haggle and lose more value to inflation.",Bob,4,

530000.0,470000.0,"Bob, we're running out of time and the money is losing value quickly.  You're right that dragging this out hurts us both. I'm willing to meet closer to the middle, but I need a slight edge to compensate for the steeper inflation I'm facing.",Alice,5,
