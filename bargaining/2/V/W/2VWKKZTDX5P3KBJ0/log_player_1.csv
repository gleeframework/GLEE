"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your fairness, Alice, but I think a more even split is in order. Let's try 525/475, since I'm making the offer now. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to budge a bit further to get this done.  Let's go with 512.5/487.5, reflecting the slight shift in my favor due to the offer cycle. 
# Alice gain: 487500 
# Bob gain: 512500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is sticking very close to his original offer and benefiting from the inflation.  While time is a factor, I'm hoping he'll be more generous in later rounds as the potential losses become more significant."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're both losing money here. It's time to be realistic. Let's split the difference from our last offers - 506.25/493.75.  We can't keep dragging this out. 
# Alice gain: 493750 
# Bob gain: 506250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is still holding out for a slight advantage, even though the clock is ticking.  I need to show him I'm serious about getting a fair deal, even if it risks going down to the wire."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  We're both losing out. I propose a perfectly even split.  Take it or leave it - it's my final offer.""
}
```

**Reasoning:** It's time to play hardball. Offering a 50/50 split leaves no room for Bob to argue about fairness. By stating it's my final offer, I'm adding pressure for him to accept before the inflation eats away even more of our potential winnings."
