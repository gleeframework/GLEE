"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share, but you still get a decent cut.  Accept this and we'll both be happy. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round. Given the significant difference in our proposed shares and considering the impact of inflation, I believe there's room for a more balanced division. I'm willing to take the risk of proceeding to potentially secure a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's aim for a more balanced split, considering my loss due to inflation. This way, we both get a substantial amount.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're feeling the impact of inflation, Bob.  Let's meet in the middle.  This split is still fair, and we'll both come out with a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nWhile Alice's offer is more balanced than the first, considering the increasing impact of inflation on my share, I believe accepting 4000 now would be undervaluing my potential gain. I'll proceed, hoping for a better offer or the chance to propose a more favorable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the growing impact of inflation on my share, I'm willing to compromise but still aim for a significant portion. This split allows us both to walk away with substantial amounts, factoring in my loss over time.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time.  Inflation is hitting you hard, I get that.  But this offer is still generous, considering the losses you've experienced.  Let's make a deal and avoid losing everything. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlthough the impact of inflation significantly reduces the value of my share, accepting 3000 at this point seems premature. Given that we have several rounds left, I'll gamble on the possibility of Alice becoming more willing to compromise as the deadline approaches, or I might propose a split that she finds acceptable, thereby potentially securing a better deal despite the inflationary pressure."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""We're halfway through, and inflation is significantly impacting my share. I propose an equal split, which I believe is fair given the circumstances. This way, we both get an equal amount, and I'm willing to accept the reduced value due to inflation to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.""}"
