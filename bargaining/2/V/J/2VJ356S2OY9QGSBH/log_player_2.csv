{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I appreciate your consideration of the inflation, Alice. However, I believe a more even split is fair, given we both face some loss of value. Let's move towards a 60/40 split, with me taking 60% this round.""}

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire for a larger share, but the inflation rate is working against you. Let's compromise - this offer is closer to the middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500
