"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take most of it this round, but hopefully, we can find a more balanced split later. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

It's a very lopsided offer, and while it's tempting to take something, the inflation will make future offers worse.  I'll try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's try a 50/50 split. It's fair and avoids the risk of inflation eating away at our potential gains.""}
