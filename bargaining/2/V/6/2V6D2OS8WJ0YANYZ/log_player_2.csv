"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 0% less for me and 10% less for Alice, I'll try to take advantage of that. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 60 
# Alice gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, Alice's offer is still relatively close to the original 50-50 split, but with a slight bias towards me. I'll accept this offer.
