Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try an even split this time.  Since the money is worth less with each round, we need to be more flexible.  A 50/50 split is fair and gives us both something. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000
