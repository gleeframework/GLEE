"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. What do you say, Bob?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, hoping to set a fair tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer. You can take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me, and Bob's offer is 400,000, which is 40% of the original 1,000,000, I'll consider it. However, I'd like to try to negotiate a bit more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a good offer, but I'd like to counter with a slightly better one. Can you meet me at 420,000?""
}
```

I'm hoping to get a bit more, but I'm still open to compromise."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm sticking to my counteroffer from last round. This is my best and final offer. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

I'm trying to hold firm on my counteroffer, but I'm leaving the door open for Bob to negotiate further if he wants to."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise further. Take this offer or we can keep negotiating. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, my gain of 300,000 is a significant reduction. However, I still need to consider the value of the offer.

Since the money is worth less, I'll have to adjust my expectations. I'll consider this offer, but I'd like to try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a good compromise, but I'd like to try to get a bit more. Can you meet me at 320,000?""
}
```

I'm trying to squeeze out a bit more, but I'm not sure if Bob will be willing to meet me halfway."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

```

  ""alice_gain"": 320000,
  ""bob_gain"": 680000,
  ""message"": ""I'm still holding firm on my counteroffer from last round. This is my best and final offer. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

I'm trying to hold my ground, but I'm starting to get concerned that Bob might be willing to walk away if we don't meet soon."
