Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sticking to my terms. This is a fair deal considering the inflation working against you. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage working against me. While accepting her offer would give me something, it's far less than what I could get by holding out for a better deal. I need to show her I'm serious about getting a fair share, even with the time pressure."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4700, ""alice_gain"": 5300, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. Accept this offer, or I will be forced to play much more aggressively.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** Six rounds have passed, and the clock is ticking. It's crucial to make Alice realize the situation's urgency.
* **Shifting Strategy:**  Bob needs to show he's willing to negotiate but won't be pushed around. A slightly less aggressive offer than 50/50 might entice Alice while leaving room for further negotiation if needed. 
* **Threat (Calculated Risk):**  Hinting at playing ""more aggressively"" adds a layer of pressure.  Alice might be more inclined to accept this offer if she fears Bob will demand an even larger share in subsequent rounds.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between getting a decent deal and avoiding reaching a point where the rapidly inflating money makes any agreement pointless."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Alright Bob, let's compromise. This offer still gives me a slight advantage, but it's significantly closer to your proposal. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, Alice's offer in round 7 presents a necessary compromise.  Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:** The inflation is steadily eating into the value of the money. Accepting now secures a reasonable amount, whereas holding out for a slightly better deal in later rounds risks significant losses due to the accelerating inflation.
* **Alice's Movement:**  Alice shifting from her firm 60/40 stance suggests she's feeling the pressure of the dwindling time and is becoming more open to a deal. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Rejecting this offer means gambling on Alice being significantly more generous in the next few rounds. This is a risky bet considering she's been quite consistent in her valuation so far. 

It's better to secure a decent deal now than risk getting a much worse deal (or nothing at all) in the later stages when the money's value would be significantly eroded."
