Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

This offer attempts to balance fairness with the urgency of time. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I believe we can both do better.  Let's split the money more evenly this time. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is tempting, but I'm willing to gamble that he's feeling the pressure of inflation more than he's letting on.  Let's see if I can get him to sweat a little in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""The clock is ticking, Bob.  This is my final offer - take it or leave it.""
}
``` 

This offer is a bit more aggressive, but still keeps things relatively balanced.  The ""final offer"" message is a bluff, but it might be enough to push Bob towards accepting a deal."
