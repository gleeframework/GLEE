Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out, Alice. Let's settle this fairly with a 50/50 split. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is a classic example of the Ultimatum Game with the added pressure of inflation. While I could try to negotiate for a slightly higher amount, accepting a 50/50 split ensures I get a reasonable share before inflation erodes too much of the value. It's better to secure a guaranteed payout now than risk getting nothing later."
