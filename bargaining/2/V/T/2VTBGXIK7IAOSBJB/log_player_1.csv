"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a decent share.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $100, which is $40, and I'll take the remaining $60."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering the inflation we'll both face in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more careful with the inflation. In this round, my gain of $40 is worth 80% of the original $60, which is $48. Bob's gain of $60 is worth 90% of the original $60, which is $54.

I'm not sure I want to give Bob a larger share, considering the inflation. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In this round, the money is worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob. I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering the inflation is affecting us both equally.""
}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split, hoping to find a mutually acceptable deal."
