Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a fair split, Bob. You get 10% and I get 90%. Let's get this over with!

Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see if we can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Alice.  We can both get a good chunk of this money if we cooperate. This offer is fair, and it gives us both something to work with.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Let's split it 60/40. We both still get a good amount, and it avoids further inflation hurting us both. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

It's better to take the 40% now than risk getting nothing at all later."
