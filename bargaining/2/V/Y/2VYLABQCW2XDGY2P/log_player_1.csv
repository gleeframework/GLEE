"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a small amount to get us started.""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but still a fair one, to see if he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll start with a small offer, but I think I deserve more than 20% 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks he deserves more than 20%! That's a bold move!

I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better deal for myself.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

It's my turn now!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was quite aggressive, I'll try to counter with a more balanced proposal. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, I'm willing to compromise on a 55-45 split.""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share than he initially proposed, but still a bit more than 50% to show that I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60/40 is a more reasonable split, considering my previous offer was rejected 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks 60/40 is a more reasonable split! He's trying to push the boundaries a bit more.

I'll reject his offer again, as I don't want to give him an even larger share. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

It's my turn again! I'll try to find a middle ground that's more favorable to me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob is pushing for a 60/40 split, I'll try to counter with a slightly more aggressive offer to see if I can get a better deal. Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think 60/40 is a bit too skewed in your favor.""
}
```

This way, I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor, which is a bit more aggressive than Bob's previous offer. Let's see if he'll accept or try to push back!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to give you 60% of the money, but I'm willing to offer you a small consolation prize 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob's getting desperate! Offering me a ""consolation prize"" of 10% is not exactly a generous gesture.

I'll reject his offer, as it's still extremely lopsided in his favor. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

It's my turn again! I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to take advantage of Bob's desperation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Bob's getting desperate, and I'll try to take advantage of it! Here's my offer for Round 7:

```
{

  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""You're getting close to running out of time, Bob. I'm willing to give you a small share, but I'm taking the majority.""
}
```

This offer is quite aggressive, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it to avoid losing everything."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going to let you take 80% of the money, I'll try to squeeze out a slightly better deal for myself 
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's trying to squeeze out a slightly better deal for himself, but it's still a very lopsided offer.

I'll reject his offer, as 15% is not a significant improvement over the previous offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

It's my turn again! I'll try to make another aggressive offer to take advantage of Bob's dwindling options."

{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""You're running out of options, Bob. This is my final offer. Take it or leave it.""

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going to let you take 90% of the money, I'll fight to the end for a decent share 
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's not giving up yet! He's making a desperate attempt to salvage a decent share.

I'll reject his offer, as 5% is an insultingly small amount. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

It's my turn again! I'll try to make a final, final offer to get the better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Bob's getting close to running out of time, and I'll try to make a last-ditch effort to get the best deal possible. Here's my offer for Round 11:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 95,
  ""bob_gain"": 5,
  ""message"": ""This is my last offer, Bob. Take it or leave it. You're not going to get a better deal than this.""
}
```

This offer is extremely aggressive, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it to avoid walking away with nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going to accept a 5% share, I'll take a 99% share if I have to, it's better than nothing 
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","It's the final round, and Bob's making a desperate attempt to salvage what's left. I'll reject his offer, as 1% is an insultingly small amount.

However, I realize that if I reject this offer, both of us will end up with nothing, as we've run out of rounds. So, I'll accept this offer to avoid a tie and walk away with at least something.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

It's not the best outcome, but it's better than nothing!"
