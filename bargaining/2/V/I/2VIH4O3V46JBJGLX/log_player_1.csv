"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can seal the deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000, and I'll get $9,000. I'm hoping he'll accept this fair offer and we can end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A decent offer, but I'm looking for a better split. Your turn to think again! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Considering the inflation, my $6,000 gain is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, which is a significant decrease.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. After some consideration, I'll...

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll have to be more aggressive with my offer. Here's my next proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""Time to take a bigger share. Don't want to leave you with too much!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $3,000, and I'll take $7,000. Let's see if he'll accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's split it evenly this time! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain! With the money worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'm not getting as much as I was hoping for.

However, Bob's offer of a 50/50 split is a good one. Considering the decreasing value of money, I think this might be a good opportunity to accept and get something, rather than risking further rejection and losing even more value.

I'll...
