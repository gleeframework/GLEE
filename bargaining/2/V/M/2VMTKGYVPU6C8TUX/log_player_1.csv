"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This offer gives me 60% of the initial $10,000, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, my initial offer from round 1 is now worth $6,000 to me and $4,000 to Bob.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll decide to reject it since I can do better than a 50-50 split, especially considering the inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less than the initial $10,000, I'll make a new offer that takes this into account.

Here's my offer for round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

This offer gives me a slightly larger share, but still leaves Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the money is worth 27.1% less than the initial $10,000, my initial offer from round 1 is now worth $4,320 to me and $3,200 to Bob.

Bob's offer in round 4 is a 45-55 split, which is still not in my favor. However, I'll consider it since it's getting close to the end of the rounds.
