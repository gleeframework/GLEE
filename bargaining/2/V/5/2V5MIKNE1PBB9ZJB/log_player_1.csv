"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I propose a 90/10 split, with me getting 90 and Bob getting 10.  I'm being generous in the first round, as I want to see if he'll accept a fair deal or be greedy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is worse than the previous round, and we haven't even reached the third round yet. It's clear he's trying to take advantage of the inflation factor.  I'll reject his offer and hope for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I'll raise my offer slightly to 85/15, still a fair deal considering the inflation. Hopefully, this will show Bob I'm willing to compromise but not be taken advantage of."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting progressively worse, and the inflation is making it even less appealing. I'm not going to accept this. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm going to lower my offer to 80/20, showing a willingness to compromise while still ensuring a decent share for myself. Inflation is getting worse, and it's time for a more aggressive approach."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even though the inflation has drastically reduced my share, a 50/50 split isn't fair considering Bob's complete disregard for the situation. I'm still hoping for a better deal in the next round, but it's getting tight."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}
```

I'm going to make a final attempt at a reasonable compromise with a 75/25 split.  Inflation is seriously biting now, but I'm still trying to secure a decent portion.  If Bob rejects this, I'll be forced to accept whatever he offers in the next round to avoid getting nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse, and the inflation is hitting me hard.  I'm desperate, but I won't settle for such a terrible deal.  I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35}
```

I'm running out of options, but I need to secure at least some money. I'm lowering my offer again to 65/35, hoping Bob will finally compromise.  The inflation is crippling, and I can't afford to lose everything."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I have to accept this offer. The inflation has devastated my potential earnings, and I'm left with no leverage. Even though it's a terrible deal, it's better than getting nothing at all. I've been outsmarted and outmaneuvered by Bob's greed and the cruel hand of inflation."
