"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'd like to take a bit more this time, but still be fair. Let's see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since Bob's offer is 60/40, I'm not thrilled about it. However, I don't want to reject it without making a counteroffer. I'll try to negotiate.

{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with 60/40. How about 55/45?""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60/40, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's closer to 50/50. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 475000, ""bob_gain"": 525000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle?""}

Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this offer!"
