Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor. This gives Bob a small starting amount, but I think it's a fair reflection of my position as the first proposer. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, the 50/50 split is fair given the inflation and the fact that I rejected his first offer.  It's better to take the guaranteed $5000 than risk getting nothing."
