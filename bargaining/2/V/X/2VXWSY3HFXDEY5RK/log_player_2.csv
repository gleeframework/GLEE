# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I propose we split the money 60/40 in my favor. It's a good start, and we can adjust later if needed.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split in my favor is more fair, considering the inflation rates will benefit me more than you. Let's see if you agree.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I understand the inflation advantage is working in your favor. I'm willing to compromise a little further and offer a 55/45 split. This feels like a more equitable compromise considering the changing value of the money. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
