"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 30% of the initial 100$ and keeping 70% for myself. This way, we both get a decent share, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice.  A 50/50 split seems like the best way to start. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 10% less, so I need to be careful.

However, Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, which is a fair one. I'm not sure if I can do better than this, and it's a good opportunity to end the game.
