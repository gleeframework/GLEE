"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to negotiate if you want more.""
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob gets 40%. I'm leaving room for him to negotiate if he wants more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but still willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 5% less, so I'd be getting 0.95 x 600,000 = 570,000.

I'm not sure I like Bob's offer, since I'd be getting less than I initially proposed. I'll reject it and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less now (5% less than the initial value, and another 5% less from the previous round), my gain is worth 0.95 x 0.95 = 0.9025 of the initial value.

I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise further. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you in the middle, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 0.85 x 0.95 x 0.95 = 0.80225 of the initial value.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with a 50-50 split, especially since my gain is worth less than Bob's. However, I don't want to reject another offer and risk getting an even worse deal.

I'll accept this offer, hoping that I can still get a better deal in future rounds.
