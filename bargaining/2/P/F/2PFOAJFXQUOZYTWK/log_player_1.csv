"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split the money 60/40 in my favor. While I understand inflation is a factor, I believe this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
