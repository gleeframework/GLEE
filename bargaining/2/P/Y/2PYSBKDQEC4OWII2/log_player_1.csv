"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer, Bob. Accept and we can finalize the deal.""
}
```

I'm offering you $200,000, and I'll take the remaining $800,000. Let's see if you'll accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your generosity, but I think we can do better for both of us. Let's flip the script this time. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see that Bob wants to flip the script!

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to be careful. My gain of $200,000 in Round 2 is worth 80% of what it was in Round 1, and Bob's gain of $800,000 is worth 90% of what it was in Round 1.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept this offer yet. I'll wait for a better one!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, my gain is worth 64% of what it was in Round 1 (80% of 80% = 64%). I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 640000,
  ""bob_gain"": 360000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Let's find a middle ground.""
}
```

I'm offering you $360,000, and I'll take the remaining $640,000. Will you accept this offer?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm trying to be fair here, Alice. Let's split the difference this time and end this game. 
# Alice gain: 360000 
# Bob gain: 640000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to split the difference!

In Round 4, my gain of $360,000 is worth 36.8% of what it was in Round 1 (64% of 56.8% = 36.8%). I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Since Bob's offer is the same as my previous offer, and my gain is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept this offer yet. I'll wait for a better one!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 5, my gain is worth 38.4% of what it was in Round 1 (36.8% of 1.04 = 38.4%). I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 384000,
  ""bob_gain"": 616000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, Bob. Let's see if we can find a deal.""
}
```

I'm offering you $616,000, and I'll take the remaining $384,000. Will you accept this offer?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close to the end. This is my final offer.  Let's make a deal and avoid getting nothing. 
# Alice gain: 488000 
# Bob gain: 512000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is making a final push for a deal.

In Round 6, my gain of $488,000 is worth 48.8% of what it was in Round 1 (67.23% of 72.4% = 48.8%). I'll have to consider this offer carefully.

However, since Bob's gain is worth 40.95% of what it was in Round 1, it's actually a relatively good deal for me compared to my previous offers.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer and take $488,000. Better than getting nothing!"
