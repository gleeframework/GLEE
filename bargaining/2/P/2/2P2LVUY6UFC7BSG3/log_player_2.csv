I'm going to reject this offer, Bob.  We'll see if Alice will give me a better deal in the next round.  I want more than 40 bucks!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be a little more fair this time.  I'm willing to take less than a 50/50 split.  What do you say?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting closer, but I still want a bit more 
# Bob gain: 60 
# Alice gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

I'll take it! This is a better offer than what I proposed, and with inflation, I'm losing value every round.  Let's call it a day."
