"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a proposal that I think is reasonable. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

I think this is a fair split, with me getting a slightly larger share, but still leaving Bob with a significant amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain is now worth 10% less, but Bob's gain is worth 20% less, which makes his share even more disproportionate. I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll aim for a more balanced split. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair given the reduced value of the money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","With the significant inflation effect, my gain is worth a lot less, and Bob's gain is worth even less. However, this offer is even more skewed in Bob's favor than the previous one. I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Given the extreme inflation effect, I'll try to get a decent share. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60}

I'm proposing a 40-60 split, which is still a bit more favorable to me, but I'm trying to be more realistic given the reduced value of the money."
