**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing tough, but time is working against me more than her.  I need to show I'm willing to walk away, but I also need to offer something more tempting next round.  It's a gamble."

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough spot. While I'd prefer a larger share, inflation is killing my potential gains.  Alice is clearly willing to let the clock run down, and her offers are only getting worse from my perspective. Accepting now avoids the risk of getting nothing if she continues to play hardball."
