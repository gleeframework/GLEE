"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 70, you get 30. What do you say?""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll match your fairness, but I think I deserve a bit more. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is biting!

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a fair compromise, but I'm not sure I want to give him an equal share. I'll try to negotiate a bit more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to match fairness, but I think I deserve a bit more. I'll make a new offer: 55 for me, 45 for you.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm still willing to compromise. I'll take 45, you get 55. What do you say?""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are starting to add up!

Considering Bob's new offer, I'm not thrilled about giving him a 20% larger share, but I'm willing to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm comfortable with a 20% difference. I'll try to squeeze a bit more out of the deal. I'll offer: 42 for me, 58 for you.""
