"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```
I'm offering you $4,000, and I'll take the remaining $6,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I can still consider the offer in terms of the original $10,000. In this case, Bob is offering a 50-50 split, which is a fair deal. I accept the offer.
