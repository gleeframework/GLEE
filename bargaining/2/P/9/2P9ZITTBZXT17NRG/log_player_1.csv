"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering to keep 80% of the money and give Bob 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 40$ is actually worth 36$ (10% less than the 40$ I would have gotten in the first round). Bob's gain of 60$ is worth 57$ (5% less than the 60$ he would have gotten in the first round).

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this offer, as it's not as favorable to me as my original offer, considering the inflation. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more given the initial proposal. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm now offering to keep 60% of the money and give Bob 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet in the middle and give you a 50/50 split, but I think this is a fair and reasonable compromise. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 50$ is actually worth 36.5$ (27.1% less than the 50$ I would have gotten in the first round). Bob's gain of 50$ is worth 43$ (14.26% less than the 50$ he would have gotten in the first round).

I think this offer is a good compromise, and I'm willing to accept a 50/50 split. I'll take it.
