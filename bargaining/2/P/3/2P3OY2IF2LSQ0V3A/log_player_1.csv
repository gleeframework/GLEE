"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20, seems fair""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, no haggling 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 5000 * 0.9 = 4500
* Bob gain: 5000 * 0.9 = 4500

I accept Bob's offer.
