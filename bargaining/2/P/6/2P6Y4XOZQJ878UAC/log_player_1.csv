"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm offering a 60-40 split, giving me the majority of the money, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about it.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not as concerned about the inflation. However, Bob's offer is a 40-60 split, which is a better deal for me than my original offer.

I'll accept this offer.
