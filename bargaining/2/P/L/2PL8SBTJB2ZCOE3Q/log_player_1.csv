"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but still keep most of the money 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, the $4000 I gain in this round is worth less than the $5000 I could have gained in the first round.

I'm not convinced by Bob's offer, and I'd like to negotiate further. I'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I still think I deserve a bit more""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a good share and being reasonable, considering the inflation effect."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving away too much 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really starting to take a toll on my potential earnings. Considering the reduced value of the money, I'm not happy with Bob's offer. The $3500 I'd gain in this round is worth significantly less than the $5000 I could have gained in the first round.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, but I'm willing to meet you halfway""
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise, but I'm not giving up yet. I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm being reasonable and willing to meet him halfway."
