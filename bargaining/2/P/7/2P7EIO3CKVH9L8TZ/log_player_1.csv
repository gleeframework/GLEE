"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable for a fair division of the initial $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take it! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more cautious now. Since the money is worth 20% less for me, I'll aim for a higher share. I'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll aim for a higher share. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You're being too greedy, let's meet in the middle""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, which seems more favorable to me given the decreasing value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'm not budging! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth less and less with each round. I'll have to be careful not to give away too much. However, Bob's offer is not as bad as I thought, considering the decreasing value of the money. I'll accept this offer.
