"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 equally, with each of us getting $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60/40 is a good start.  I'm willing to give you a little more since I get to make the first offer. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I'm willing to consider it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'd like to make a counteroffer and see if Bob is willing to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

I'm proposing a slightly more generous offer, with me getting $5,500 and Bob getting $4,500."
