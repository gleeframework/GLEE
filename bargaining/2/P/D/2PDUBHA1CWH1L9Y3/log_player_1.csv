"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose taking 900,000 dollars for myself and leaving 100,000 for Bob. This way, we both get something, and I get the majority share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to lower my share a bit to 800,000, hoping to incentivize Bob to accept. I still want a larger portion, but I recognize that he's willing to play hardball, and we're losing money with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While the offer is tempting, I'm still holding out for a larger share. We've already lost a significant amount of money due to inflation, and with only eight rounds left, the value of the money will continue to decrease rapidly. I believe I can still get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000} 
```

I'm going to lower my share again to 700,000, hoping to convince Bob that it's in his best interest to accept.  We are running out of time, and the inflation is seriously impacting the potential gains. This seems like a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I still believe I can secure a better deal. Even though inflation is making the money worth less, I'm not willing to settle for less than half of the remaining value. We've already lost a significant amount, but there are still six rounds left, and the value of the money will continue to decrease rapidly. I need to take a gamble and try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000} 
```

I'm going to lower my share to 600,000, leaving 400,000 for Bob. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair offer considering how much money we've lost to inflation. We only have five rounds left, and the value of the money will continue to decrease rapidly. This seems like the best way to ensure we both get something substantial before it's too late."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I still believe I can do better, even though we're losing a significant amount of money due to inflation.  The remaining amount is still substantial, and I'm determined to get a larger share.  With four rounds left, the value of the money will continue to decrease, but I think I can still negotiate a more favorable deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000} 
```

I'm going to propose a 50/50 split. With only three rounds left, the value of the money is diminishing rapidly. We are both losing out with every round, and this seems like the most rational solution to ensure we both get something significant. It's time to be practical and avoid further losses."
