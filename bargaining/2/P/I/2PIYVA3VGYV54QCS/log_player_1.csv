"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer, Bob. Accept and we can seal the deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000, which is a relatively small amount, but it's a good starting point. I'll get the remaining $9,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair.  I propose a split that's closer to even.  Accept this and we can move on. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money losing value due to inflation, I'll need to be more cautious. However, Bob's offer is still quite generous, and I think I can live with it.
