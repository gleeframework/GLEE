Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money in a 3:1 ratio. This might seem fair considering the diminishing value of money over time.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the initial value of the money. This offer is a good starting point, but I'm hoping we can get closer to a 1:1 ratio. 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","{
