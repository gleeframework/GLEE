"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly, I'll take a bit more""
}
```

I'm offering to take $5,500 and give Bob $4,500, with a message suggesting that this is a relatively fair split, but with a slight bias in my favor. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your previous offer was a bit greedy considering the inflation. Let's split it evenly and end this. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{

  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800,
  ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I'll take a bit more, but still a good deal for you""
}

I'm offering to take $5,200 and give Bob $4,800, trying to find a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's even split proposal, while still accounting for the decreasing value of the money."
