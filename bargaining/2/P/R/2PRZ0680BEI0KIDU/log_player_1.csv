"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

``` 

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself.  It's a good starting point, but I want to see if he'll be greedy and try to get more.  Let's see what happens!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob's offer is much worse than my initial proposal.  I'm not going to accept that!  Let's see what happens in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm still going to try and keep the majority of the money, but I'm going to offer Bob a bit more this time.  He rejected my last offer, so hopefully this will be more appealing to him."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, even with the inflation. I'm still hoping to get a larger share. I'm going to keep rejecting his offers until he gets closer to my desired split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to continue to decrease my offer by $100,000 each round while keeping the balance in my favor. Hopefully, Bob will eventually realize that he needs to compromise."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low for me. He seems to be stuck on getting 700,000, but I'm hoping he realizes that he needs to be more flexible.  Let's see what happens next."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is just ridiculous. He seems to be completely ignoring the effects of inflation on my side of the bargain.  I'm not giving in to his greed.  Let's see what happens next round."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm going to propose a 50/50 split.  Inflation is really starting to bite now, and I need to ensure I get at least half to make it worthwhile.  Hopefully, Bob will realize this is the best deal he's likely to get."
