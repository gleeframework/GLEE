"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

I propose to keep most of the money for myself, leaving Bob with a small amount. This is a risky strategy, but I hope to incentivize Bob to accept quickly before the money loses value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I prefer to get more money, accepting a 50/50 split is a good deal.  We are already in the second round, and the risk of getting nothing is real.  A fair split is better than risking everything."
