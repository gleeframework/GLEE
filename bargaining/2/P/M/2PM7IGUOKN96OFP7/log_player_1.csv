Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start by being generous and offering Bob $1,000.  This leaves $9,000 for me.  I hope he accepts!  Let's see how this goes."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer to have more money, I don't want to risk getting nothing at all.  Accepting this offer guarantees me $5,000, which is better than risking getting $0 if we go further and the inflation hits me harder."
