"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's offer was 25/75, I'll try to counter with a similar ratio, but with a slight bias towards myself. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 30, ""alice_gain"": 70}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual amount I'd gain in this round is 40 * 0.9091 (1 - 0.0909) = 36.364, which is less than the 30 I would have gained in the previous round. I'll reject this offer to try to get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 9.75% less than in the first round, I'll try to adjust my offer accordingly. I'll aim for a slightly higher share than before, considering the decreasing value of the money. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55}"
