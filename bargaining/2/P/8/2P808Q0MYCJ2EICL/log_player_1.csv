"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get a good start, I'll give you a fair share!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000. This is a generous offer, considering the money will be worth 20% less in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly. We both get a good chunk of money this way. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, my gain of $500,000 is now worth $400,000.

I accept Bob's offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
