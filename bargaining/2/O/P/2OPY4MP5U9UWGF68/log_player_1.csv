"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

I'm proposing a 9000/1000 split in my favor.  I want to secure a large portion of the money early on, knowing inflation will likely erode the value of any remaining money in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject this offer. While it is a more even split, I'm still confident I can secure a better deal for myself. Even with the inflation, my gains will be higher if I can get a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm offering an 8000/2000 split. I'm willing to give up some of my initial gain from the first round, but I still want to secure a substantial share before the effects of inflation become too significant."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. Even though inflation is taking a bigger bite out of my gains, I believe I can still secure a better deal for myself. I'll continue to aim for a larger share in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm offering a 7000/3000 split.  While the inflation is hitting hard, I'm still confident I can get a good deal for myself. I need to maintain a larger share to offset the declining value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. Inflation has significantly eroded the value of the money, and I'm not confident I can get a better deal in the next round.  It's time to cut my losses and secure at least something."
