"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly, considering future losses""
}
```

I'm offering to take 55% of the money and leave 45% for Bob. This seems like a reasonable starting point, considering that the money loses value over time, but not so skewed that Bob would reject it outright. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split evenly to be fair and avoid the risk of further inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 5800,
  ""bob_gain"": 4200,
  ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a better deal for you than the last round""
}

I've increased my share slightly, but the value of the money has decreased due to inflation, so this offer is still relatively reasonable. Let's see if Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to concede a bit to avoid further inflation, but I believe this split is fair given the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Inflation is hitting you harder, this might be the best deal you'll get""
}

I'm trying to take advantage of the fact that inflation is affecting Bob's gains more than mine. This offer is a bit more aggressive, but I'm hoping Bob will realize that the value of the money is decreasing rapidly and accept this deal before it's too late."
