"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and you get 10%, but remember, inflation is a factor! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While this seems like a fair deal for the first round, I'd like to see if I can get a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I think we can both do better than that! Let's split the money more evenly.  I'll take 55% and you get 45%.  It's a win-win, as we'll both get more than we did in the last round.  Let's make a deal!""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 60/40, with me taking 60% and you taking 40%.  I'm sure you can see that this is a better deal than last round, even with the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
This offer is slightly better than what I offered in the previous round, and it's likely that if I reject it, the next offer will be even less favorable due to inflation."
