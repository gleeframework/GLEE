"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $10,000, which is $6,000, and Bob gets 40%, which is $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can do better than that! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled with the offer, but I'll consider it.

Since the money is worth 10% less, I'll calculate the actual value of the offer:

Alice gain: $3,000 (initially worth $3,300)
Bob gain: $7,000 (initially worth $7,700)

I'll decide to reject this offer and proceed to the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""A slight adjustment, but still a fair split!""}

I'm proposing that I get 45% of the initial $10,000, which is $4,500, and Bob gets 55%, which is $5,500."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a little less, but I'm being generous! 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

Let me calculate the actual value of the offer, taking into account the 27.1% reduction:

Alice gain: $3,500 (initially worth $4,800)
Bob gain: $6,500 (initially worth $8,900)

I'm not thrilled with this offer, but I'll consider it. I'll decide to reject this offer and proceed to the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and make a deal!""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, with each of us getting $5,000."
