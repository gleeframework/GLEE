Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get a bit more. Let's split it closer to 55/45. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting increasingly desperate as inflation eats into his potential gains. While his offer is closer to even, I'm still in a strong position to push for a better deal. We're getting closer to the point where Bob will be forced to accept a less favorable deal to avoid walking away with nothing."

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're running out of time, Alice. Let's split it down the middle and end this. It's the fairest option for both of us now. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, this offer is the best I'm likely to get at this point. Bob is clearly feeling the pressure of inflation and is unlikely to offer me more. Accepting now guarantees me a significant sum, whereas continuing to play risks ending up with nothing if we fail to reach an agreement."
