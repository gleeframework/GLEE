"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split, with me getting $900,000 and Bob getting $100,000.  This gives me a significant share while still offering Bob a decent sum. I'm hoping he'll accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer guarantees me a significant amount of money, especially considering the inflation factor.  It's a fair split, and I don't want to risk getting nothing if we keep rejecting offers."
