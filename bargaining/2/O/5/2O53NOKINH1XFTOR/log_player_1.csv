"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 

I'll start by offering a 90/10 split in my favor.  This feels like a fair starting point, as I'm the one proposing first.  I'm curious to see if Bob will accept or try to negotiate a better deal for himself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, it's better to accept this offer. Inflation is making the money worth less with each round, and  Bob's offer gives me 50% of the remaining value, which is a good outcome given the circumstances."
