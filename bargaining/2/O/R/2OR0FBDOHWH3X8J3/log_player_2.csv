"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share, but you'll get a decent chunk.  Accept this and we both win. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While the offer is tempting, it's worth seeing if I can get a better deal in the next round.  I'm hoping that Alice will become less greedy as the rounds progress.  Plus, I have no idea how inflation affects her, so there's a chance she'll value the money more than I do."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable.  An even split is fair, and it gives us both the best chance to get something.""
