"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose that I get $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000. I believe this is a fair offer, as it gives me the majority of the money while still allowing Bob to receive something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
``` 

I propose a 50/50 split. Since Bob rejected my previous offer and the value of money is decreasing, I think a fair solution is to split the remaining value equally."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer a more even split, the value of the money is dropping rapidly and there's a chance that Bob will make a worse offer in the next round. It's better to secure at least $400,000 than risk getting nothing in the following rounds."
