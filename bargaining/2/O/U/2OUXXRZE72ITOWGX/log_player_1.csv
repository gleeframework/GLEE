"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a fair starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, 50/50 is the most logical choice. Accept this and we can end the game. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking its toll!

I'll think carefully about Bob's offer...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept a 50/50 split just yet. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With inflation taking a 20% bite out of my potential earnings, I'll have to be strategic. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. Accept this and we can move forward.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, trying to balance my desire for a higher share with the need to keep the game going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm offering you 40, and taking 60 for myself.  This is a fair deal considering the inflation we're experiencing. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering the rapidly decreasing value of money, I'll have to think carefully about Bob's offer...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 40-60 split, even with the inflation. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of the time limit."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money's value continuing to plummet, I'll have to be even more strategic. Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 48,
  ""bob_gain"": 52,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need something in return. Accept this and we can move forward.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 48-52 split, trying to find a balance between my desire for a decent share and the need to keep the game going."
