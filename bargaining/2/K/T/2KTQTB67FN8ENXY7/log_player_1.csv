"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can move on!""
}
```

This way, I'll get 90% of the money, and Bob will get 10%. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split this evenly. It's the most fair option, and we can both walk away with a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, I'll have to adjust my thinking.

I don't think splitting it evenly is the most fair option, considering I've already lost 10% of the value of the money due to inflation. I'd like to try to get a slightly better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll make a new offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. Take this and we can move on.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair compromise.  We both get a good share, and we can move on to more important things. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value. With the money being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'll have to be careful with my decisions.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with Bob getting a larger share, considering I've already lost so much value due to inflation. I'll try to negotiate further.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The value of the money continues to decrease. I'll have to be more aggressive with my offer.
