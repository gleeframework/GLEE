60.0,40.0,"Let's start with a reasonable offer. I take $60, you take $40. This ensures we both benefit from dividing the money sooner rather than later.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,Your offer was a bit too much in your favor. Let's be fairer and split it closer to the middle. This way we both still benefit from an early agreement.,Bob,2,
,,"While I appreciate the attempt at a more even split, this offer doesn't reflect the decreasing value of the money. Let's try to find a solution that benefits us both in the long run.",Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,Time is ticking and the money is losing value.  I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. This acknowledges the faster rate of devaluation you face.,Alice,3,
