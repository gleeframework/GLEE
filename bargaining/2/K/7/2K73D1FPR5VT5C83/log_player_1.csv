"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

This is a fair starting point, offering Bob slightly less than half the money. It's a good strategy to avoid the negative impact of inflation as quickly as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer ensures a decent payout for me. It's also likely that Bob would propose something less favorable in the next round, given his lower inflation rate."
