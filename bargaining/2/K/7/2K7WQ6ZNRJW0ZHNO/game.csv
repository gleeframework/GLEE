6000.0,4000.0,"Let's start with a simple offer. I get $6,000, you get $4,000. A fair deal to kick things off.",Alice,1,

4500.0,5500.0,"I think we can both do better than that.  Let's start with a more even split.  I'll take $5500, and you can have $4500.  It's a fair deal, and we can both walk away happy.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5800.0,4200.0,"Bob, your offer was tempting, but let's be realistic. I'm aiming for a slightly better outcome for myself. This is still a good deal for you before inflation eats away at it further.",Alice,3,

4750.0,5250.0,"Alice,  let's be reasonable.  Inflation is going to eat away at the value of the money.  I'm willing to take a little less than my previous offer, but I need a bit more than what you're proposing.  $5250 for me, $4750 for you.  It's a fair compromise, and we can both move on from this game.",Bob,4,

5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, I understand the impact of inflation, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. This offer is a fair split, and it ensures we both benefit before the money loses more value.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Alice, we're both losing money with each round.  Let's be smart and split the money evenly. $5000 each, no more arguing.  It's the best outcome for both of us.",Bob,6,
