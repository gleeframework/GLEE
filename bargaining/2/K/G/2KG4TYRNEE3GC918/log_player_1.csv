Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering you $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself."

# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 0% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll consider the offer. However, I'd like to get a better deal. I'll reject this offer.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less for Bob now (5% less than the initial amount, and another 5% less from the previous round), I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 14.26% less for Bob and the same for me, I'll consider the offer. This is a relatively small amount for me, but I'll think it's a good opportunity to end the game. I'll accept this offer.
