Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose an even split of $50 for each of us.  Let's see if Bob agrees!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred a more even split, I'd rather take $40 now than risk getting nothing in the next round."
