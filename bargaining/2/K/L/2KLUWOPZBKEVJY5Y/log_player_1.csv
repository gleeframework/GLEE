"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we both get $5000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'm not too concerned about the value of my share. However, I'm not thrilled about the 40/60 split, as I was hoping for a more equal division.

After considering the offer, I decide to:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I'm trying to make a slightly more favorable split for myself, but still leaving Bob with a decent share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob's offer is quite aggressive this time!

As the value of the money Bob gains is significantly lower due to inflation, I'm not too concerned about the absolute value of his share. However, I'm not thrilled about the 30/70 split, as I was hoping for a more balanced division.

After considering the offer, I decide to:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm trying to make a slightly more balanced split, taking into account the reduced value of Bob's share due to inflation."
