"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, Bob. I'll take 90% and you can have 10%. It's a good starting point!

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's try again.  I'm willing to lower my share a bit, but 80/20 is still a reasonable split.  We're running out of time, and the value of the money is dropping for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down slightly, the deal is still heavily skewed in her favor.  The longer we wait, the more the inflation hurts me. It's time to incentivize Alice to take a more serious offer."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be real, the clock is ticking and inflation is eating away at this deal. 50/50 is the only fair option at this point. Take it or leave it.""}
