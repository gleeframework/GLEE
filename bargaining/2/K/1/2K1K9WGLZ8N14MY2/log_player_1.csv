"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself. This is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but still leaving you with a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money I gain is worth 20% less, so the 300,000$ I would get is actually 240,000$ in real terms.

I'm not too happy about this offer, but I'll consider it. I'd rather not risk waiting for another round and getting even less.

I'll accept this offer.
