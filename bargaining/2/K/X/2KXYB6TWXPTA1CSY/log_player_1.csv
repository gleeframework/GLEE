"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

This offer gives Alice a slightly larger share, but I think it's fair enough to start the negotiation. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is getting a significantly larger share of the money now, and the inflation is hurting me more than him.  I'm going to try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5250, ""bob_gain"": 4750}
```

I'm going to try to increase my share a bit, but also keep it relatively fair given the inflation situation.  I'm willing to compromise, but I won't let Bob take advantage of the inflation too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is really bad for me now, and I'm still losing a lot more to inflation than he is. I'm going to try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

This round, I'm going to propose an even split. Given the inflation, we're both losing a lot of money with each round. This offer at least prevents us from losing more money due to a drawn-out negotiation."
