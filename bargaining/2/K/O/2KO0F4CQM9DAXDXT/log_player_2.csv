"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable and end this quickly. This gives you a fair share before inflation eats into the value. 
# Bob gain: 150000 
# Alice gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer.  While it's a decent starting point, I want to see if I can get a better deal for myself, especially considering the inflation factor will hurt Alice more than me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think this is a fair split, given the inflation factor will impact you more than me.  Let's end this quickly and both get a decent share.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the inflation puts pressure on me, but your previous offer was much too low. This offer is still heavily skewed in your favor, let's be realistic and end this. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is still too low, considering the inflation pressure is significantly impacting her. I'm going to continue to try and negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to go up a bit from my previous offer, but this is the best I can do.  Inflation is hitting you hard, but I'm also taking a risk by continuing this game. Let's reach an agreement.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to compromise, but this needs to be a two-way street. This offer reflects that I understand the inflation pressure, but it also acknowledges the value of a fair deal. Let's end this here. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

I'm going to accept this offer.  While I'd prefer a larger share, Alice's offer is fair considering the significant inflation that's affecting her. Continuing the game risks losing everything for both of us, so it's time to settle for a decent outcome."
