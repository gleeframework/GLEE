Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 600000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to go up a bit from my previous offer, but this is the best I can do.  Inflation is hitting you hard, but I'm also taking a risk by continuing this game. Let's reach an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is using the inflation against me, but he's not budging much from his heavily skewed offers.  It's a waiting game for him now, hoping I panic as the rounds go on. I need to hold firm and show him I'm willing to risk it for a better deal. Accepting now would be a mistake, even at the cost of further inflation."
