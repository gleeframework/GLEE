"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}

This means I'm offering to take 80 dollars and give Bob 20 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my 50 dollars is now worth less than 40 dollars. I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the inflation. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}"
