"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me 60 dollars and Bob 40 dollars. My message is a friendly one, suggesting a fair and equal split to start the game."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You got greedy, now it's my turn to take the lead! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take the lead!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth 5% less for me, I'll have to be cautious.

I'll reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 20-80 split, especially considering the decreased value of the money due to inflation. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."

  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, a more balanced split this time!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, which is more balanced and takes into account the decreased value of the money due to inflation. My message is a friendly one, suggesting a compromise to move the game forward."

# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take advantage of my desperation!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. The money is worth significantly less for me now, and Bob's offer is quite aggressive.

I'll reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 10-90 split, especially considering the substantial decrease in the value of the money due to inflation. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round, but I'll have to be more cautious."

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 5-95 split, especially considering the substantial decrease in the value of the money due to inflation. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round, but I'll have to be very cautious with the remaining time."
