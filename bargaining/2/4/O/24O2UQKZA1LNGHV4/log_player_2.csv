Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: Considering the significant inflation impact on your end, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Even though the offer is worse than previous rounds, it is still better than the outcome of rejecting and having to split it 50/50 in the next round, especially considering the significant inflation impact on my side."
