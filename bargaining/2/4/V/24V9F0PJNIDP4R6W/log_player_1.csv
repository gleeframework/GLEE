"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm starting with a 60/40 split in my favor, as I lose less value per round.  I'm hoping Bob will accept this, as he's likely to lose more if he rejects and we proceed to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I lose more value with each round than Bob, my offer was rejected in the previous round.  This means that Bob is likely to be more willing to accept an offer in his favor, especially as the game progresses and his value decreases at a faster rate.  Accepting this offer is the most financially advantageous option for me at this point."
