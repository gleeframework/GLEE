{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""Fair and simple split, let's get started!""}

I'm proposing a 4:1 split, with me getting 80% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob getting 20%. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."

# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's proposal, but I'll consider it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think it's still too skewed in his favor. I was hoping for a more balanced split, and this offer doesn't meet my expectations. I'll keep negotiating!"

I'm proposing a 3:2 split, with me getting 60% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob getting 40%. I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I still want to make sure I get a significant portion of the money."

# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob's offer is getting more aggressive!

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's extremely unfair. I'm not willing to accept a share that's less than 10% of the total amount. I think Bob is trying to take advantage of the fact that I'm getting less value from the money due to inflation. I'll keep pushing for a better deal!"

# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","Oh no, Bob's offer is getting more and more outrageous!

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's completely unacceptable. I'm not willing to accept a share that's less than 1% of the total amount. I think Bob is trying to take advantage of the fact that I'm getting less value from the money due to inflation, and I'm not going to let him get away with it. I'll keep pushing for a better deal!"
