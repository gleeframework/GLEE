"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. Time is money! 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see what Alice's counter offer is!  It's worth testing the waters to see if we can do better."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I believe a more balanced approach is necessary. Let's work together to ensure a fair outcome.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my friend, inflation is eating away at your potential gains. Let's be reasonable and close this deal. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer more, the inflation is making it harder to get a better deal.  It's time to take what I can get."
