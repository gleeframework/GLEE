"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and simple""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take a slightly skewed deal, but it's a good starting point 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 20% less, I need to consider the relative value of the offer.

In this round, Bob's offer is effectively worth 80% of the value of my original 50/50 split. So, I'd be getting 80% of $5000, which is $4000, and Bob would be getting 80% of $5000, which is $4000.

Considering this, I'd rather wait for a better offer. Bob's offer is not significantly better than the original 50/50 split, and I'd like to see if I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the fact that Bob's offer was not very favorable to me.

Since the money is worth 40% of its original value now (80% of 50%), I'll aim to get a larger share of the remaining amount.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair deal""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet in the middle, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 51.2% of the value of my original 50/50 split (100% - 48.8%), I'd be getting 51.2% of $5000, which is $2560, and Bob would be getting 51.2% of $5000, which is $2560.

Considering this, Bob's offer is actually very close to the original 50/50 split, but slightly skewed in his favor. Since I'm not getting a significantly better deal than the original split, and considering that I've already rejected a few offers, I'll decide to accept this offer.
