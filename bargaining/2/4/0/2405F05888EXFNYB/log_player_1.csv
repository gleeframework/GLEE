"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's get started!""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I get 60 dollars and Bob gets 40 dollars. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started high, I'll start low. Will you meet me in the middle? 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly. Considering the new values, I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer. However, his message does suggest that he's willing to compromise, and 20 is a relatively low number.

I'll decide to...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 20, I'll try to increase the amount I'm willing to accept. Considering the 5% decrease in value due to inflation, I'll aim for a higher number.

Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""A bit higher, but still a fair compromise""}

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, hoping that Bob will be willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Getting closer, but still a bit short. Will you meet me here? 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on my gains!

Considering the significant decrease in value, I'll have to be more cautious with my decision. Bob's offer is getting closer to my previous proposal, but I'm still not thrilled about the 65-35 split.

However, I don't want to let the opportunity slip away, and Bob's message suggests he's willing to compromise. I'll decide to...

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
