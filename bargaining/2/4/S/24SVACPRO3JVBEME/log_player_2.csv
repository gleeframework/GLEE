"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to reject this offer. It's a bit too early to accept such a low share.  I'll try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}
``` 

I'm offering Alice 40 dollars, and keeping 60 for myself.  This is a fair starting point considering the potential inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still too low. I know the money is worth less, but I'm still hoping for a better deal. I'll reject and see what she offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}
```

I'm going to slightly decrease my offer to 55, hoping that Alice sees the value in getting something rather than risking getting nothing. Inflation is a factor, but I'm still aiming for a fair share."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

The inflation is getting serious, and I need to secure something.  While it's still not ideal, 45 is better than nothing.  I'll accept this offer."
