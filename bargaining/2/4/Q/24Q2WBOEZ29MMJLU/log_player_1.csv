"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can finalize the deal.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small portion, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can move on to the next round."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your turn was generous, but I'm looking for a better split. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I need to adjust my decision accordingly.

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 60/40 split, and I think I can do better in the next round."

  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more. Let's see if you'll accept this compromise.""

# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth less and less with each round! I'll have to adjust my strategy accordingly.

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 4:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 45/55 split, and I think I can do better in the next round. I'll try to get a better deal, but I'll have to be more aggressive given the decreasing value of the money."

# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is really losing value quickly now! I'll consider Bob's offer for Round 6:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting the 50/50 split, as it's a fair compromise, and I don't want to risk losing more value with each passing round. Let's finalize the deal!"
