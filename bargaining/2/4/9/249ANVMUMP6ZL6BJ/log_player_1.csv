"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, hoping to set a fair tone for the negotiation. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted to split it evenly, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to his favor.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think 60% for Bob is too generous, considering the inflation is affecting me more. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less now due to inflation, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need a fair share too!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a slightly larger share and protecting my own interests. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being generous, but I'm still not satisfied with my share 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is hitting me hard! Okay, let's think this through...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think 70% for Bob is way too generous, considering the money is worth significantly less for me now. I'll have to be more careful with my next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation taking a bigger bite out of my potential gain, I need to be more cautious. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I need to protect my share!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share, but still trying to maintain a balance that works for me. Your turn, Bob!"
