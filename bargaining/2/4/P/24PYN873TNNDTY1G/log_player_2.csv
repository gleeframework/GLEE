"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer is good for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's worth seeing what Alice's next offer is, considering the inflation will reduce my gains in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""This offer is fairer, considering the inflation. Let's split it 60/40.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The inflation is working against you, Bob. Let's be realistic and close this deal. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

Even though I'm losing a significant amount due to inflation, it's better to accept this offer than risk getting nothing in the next round."
