Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Given the rapid devaluation, this is likely your best option now. 
# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

While far from ideal, Alice is right. The value of the potential gain for me is decreasing rapidly with each round. Accepting a smaller amount now is better than risking even less in future rounds, especially if Alice is unwilling to agree to a more equitable split."
