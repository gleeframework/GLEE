"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 70-30, I'll take the risk of inflation!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, giving me a larger share of the initial $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're taking too much risk, let's play it safe! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gains, I'm not as eager to take risks. But I'm not willing to give up too much either. I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I think I can do better than a 20% share. The game's not over yet!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to negotiate a better deal. With inflation, I need to be more cautious, but I still want a decent share. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 40-60 is a fair split.""
}
```

I'm proposing a more balanced split, giving Bob a larger share this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're still taking too much, I want a better deal! 
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my gains! With the money being worth 48.8% less, I'm getting desperate. But I still don't want to give up too much. I'll think carefully... and decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not willing to give Bob 85% of the remaining value. I need to keep some bargaining power for the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to be more aggressive this time, considering the severe inflation. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 10,
  ""bob_gain"": 90,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you most of it, but I need something to survive!""
}
```

I'm proposing a very lopsided split, giving Bob almost all of the remaining value. I'm hoping Bob will take this offer, but I'm not sure if he'll accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'll give you a little, but I'm taking most! 
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really crippling my gains! With the money being worth only 32.77% of its original value, I'm in a tough spot. I'm not sure if I can survive on just 5$. I'll think carefully... and decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not willing to accept such a tiny share, even if it's the last resort. I'll try to hold out for a better deal, but it's getting increasingly difficult."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'm running out of options, and the inflation is making it harder to survive. I'll try to make one last attempt to salvage something. Here's my final offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 2,
  ""bob_gain"": 98,
  ""message"": ""I'm desperate, take the rest, I'll just barely survive""
}
```

I'm proposing a ridiculously small share for myself, hoping Bob will take pity and accept the offer."
