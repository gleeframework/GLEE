"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, then negotiate from there.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 ratio, with me getting 80% of the $10,000 and Bob getting 20%. This is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will be willing to accept it and we can move on to more interesting negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted to start with a fair split, I'll try to be fair too. But I think I deserve a bit more for being the one to make the first counteroffer. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting counteroffer from Bob!

I'll think for a moment... Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 10% less, I'm actually getting a better deal than I was initially, relative to the value of the money.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
