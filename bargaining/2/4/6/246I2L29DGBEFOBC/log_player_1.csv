This offer is a bit cheeky, but it sets the stage. I want to see if Bob is willing to play fair or if he's greedy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much more reasonable than mine, but I'm not willing to settle for such a small share. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

This is a more fair offer, splitting the money evenly.  I'm hoping Bob will accept it, as the next round will likely see inflation affecting both of us."
