I propose to take 9000$ and give Bob 1000$. This seems like a fair starting point, considering the potential for inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm offering Bob 2000$, and keeping 8000$ for myself.  Since Bob rejected my last offer, I'm going to lower my offer slightly to account for the potential for further inflation.  However, I'm still offering a fair share."
