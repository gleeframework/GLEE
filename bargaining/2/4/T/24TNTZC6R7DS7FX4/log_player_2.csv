"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair-ish split. I'll take 90%, and you get 10%. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm Bob, and I'm not starting with such a disadvantageous offer. Let's see what Alice proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is more reasonable. It gives you a fair share, and it's a good starting point for negotiation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split the money 60/40, with me getting 60% and you getting 40%. This is a fair offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is hitting hard, and this offer is at least fair. Let's end this game."
