"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives me the majority of the money, while still leaving Bob with a decent amount. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince him to accept, as the inflation risk increases with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While this offer is higher than my last proposal, it's still significantly less than what I believe I deserve. I'm confident I can get a better deal, especially considering the increasing inflation. I'll see what I can negotiate in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm taking a slightly less aggressive approach this round. While I'm still aiming for a large share, I'm willing to compromise to avoid another rejection. Inflation is becoming a real factor now, and I don't want to risk losing too much money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While this offer is significantly less than what I initially hoped for, it's important to acknowledge the increasing inflation and the risk of getting nothing at all. A 50/50 split ensures I receive something, which is better than being left with nothing due to the dwindling value of the money."
