I'm not sure if Alice understands the game dynamics. I'm going to reject this offer and see what she proposes next.  While it's tempting to take 40$, I want to see if I can get a better deal, especially with the inflation in play."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""I think it's fair to split the money closer to 50/50, considering the inflation. Let's be reasonable and move forward!""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bit more 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is still not great.  While I'm gaining more than the initial round, the inflation on her side is significant.  I'm going to continue to try and push for a more equal split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Let's be practical and split the money evenly. Inflation is a factor for both of us, and this offer is fair considering the circumstances.""
