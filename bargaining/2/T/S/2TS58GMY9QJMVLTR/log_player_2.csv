"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. 60/40 split seems reasonable considering the inflation we're facing. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While a 60/40 split seems fair in the first round, it's important to remember the inflation factor.  I'm going to try to negotiate a better deal for myself in the later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, considering the inflation we'll be dealing with, I think a 60/40 split in my favor is more equitable.  Let's see if you're willing to negotiate."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the impact of inflation on your end, but your last offer was a bit too skewed.  This offer is a compromise, meeting closer to the middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I'd still prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best strategy.  The inflation will continue to eat away at my potential gains, and this offer is a decent compromise. It's better than risking getting nothing at all in the final round."
