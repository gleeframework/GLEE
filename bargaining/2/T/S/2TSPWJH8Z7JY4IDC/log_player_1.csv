"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

I'm going to start with a very uneven proposal. This way, I maximize my chances of getting a good share of the money in the first round, while still leaving an incentive for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer. I will continue to fight for a more equitable distribution of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

This time I'm going to propose a fair 50/50 split. After rejecting my initial offer, Bob might be more willing to compromise."
