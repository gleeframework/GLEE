"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and start with a near even split. I take a little more since I'm making the first offer. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm not going to accept this offer just yet. I want to see what kind of deals Alice is willing to make later on, especially with the risk of inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly. Since I'm making the offer, I'll take a little more this time, but I'm willing to negotiate further if you reject.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This back and forth is pointless. Let's just split it down the middle and call it a day. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
It's better to accept this offer.  The inflation is making the money worth less with each round, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all."
