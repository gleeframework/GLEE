"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can move on!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take a slightly less generous offer, but still a good one! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

After considering Bob's offer, I'll make my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept a 2:3 ratio. I want to keep negotiating!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The game continues!

Considering the inflation and the previous offers, I'll make a new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""A more balanced offer. Let's meet in the middle!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up yet! Will you meet me halfway this time? 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll!

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll make my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to meet Bob halfway just yet. I think I can do better than a 45:55 ratio."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The game continues!

Considering the inflation and the previous offers, I'll make a new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Getting closer to the middle. Will you accept this compromise?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet exactly in the middle this time. No more negotiations! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a hit!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll make my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think it's time to meet in the middle and end the game. A 50:50 split is a fair compromise, especially considering the decreasing value of money due to inflation."
