"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a small difference, we can always negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 90% of the $100, which is $90, and Bob gets 10%, which is $10. My message to Bob is that we can start with a small difference and negotiate from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to find a more balanced split, I think we can do better than this. 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $70 in Round 2 is actually worth $70 * 0.95 = $66.50 in Round 1's value.

I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
