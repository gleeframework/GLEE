"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'm offering you a good portion of the money. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's a good starting point, I'm confident I can get a better deal considering the inflation factor and the fact that I have the power to propose in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, but I think we can both do better. Let's split the money more evenly this time.  What do you say?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split the money closer to even this time.  We don't want to keep going back and forth and risk losing money to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I would prefer a more even split, I don't want to risk losing more money to inflation.  It's a reasonable offer, and I'm willing to accept it."
