,,"While I appreciate the offer, Bob, a 50/50 split after I made a reasonable offer in the first round doesn't reflect the time pressure. I'm confident we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement.",Alice,2,reject

5200.0,4800.0,"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a little, but I need a bit more to make it worthwhile. Let's settle this with a 48/52 split. It's a strong deal for both of us with the inflation looming.",Bob,4,
