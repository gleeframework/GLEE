"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, then we can negotiate.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $70 and Bob gets $30, which is a 70-30 split. My message to Bob is that I'm starting with a fair split, and we can adjust from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted a fair split, so I'm offering a slight tilt in my favor. Will you meet me in the middle? 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll calculate the actual amounts:

My gain: 40 * 0.8 = 32
Bob's gain: 60 * 0.9 = 54

I'll respond to Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",

Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts considering the inflation:

My gain: 20 * 0.5162 = 10.324 (approximately)
Bob's gain: 80 * 0.7273 = 58.184 (approximately)

I'll respond to Bob's offer:
