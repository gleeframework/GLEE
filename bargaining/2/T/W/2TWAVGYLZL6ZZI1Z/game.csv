400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, your offer was quite bold. Let's be more realistic. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This reflects that I'm more disadvantaged by the inflation in this game. What do you say?",Bob,2,

550000.0,450000.0,"I'm willing to compromise, but a 60/40 split is too much in your favor. Let's meet in the middle with a 55/45 split.  This acknowledges the inflation disadvantage while still giving you a decent share.",Alice,3,

420000.0,580000.0,"Alice, we're running out of time, and the clock is ticking faster for me. 55/45 is still too skewed towards you considering the rapid devaluation. I'm proposing 58/42. It's a strong offer, and it's time for you to be reasonable if you want to walk away with anything substantial.",Bob,4,
