"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but a 60/40 split is too much in your favor. Let's meet in the middle with a 55/45 split.  This acknowledges the inflation disadvantage while still giving you a decent share.

# Alice gain: 550000
