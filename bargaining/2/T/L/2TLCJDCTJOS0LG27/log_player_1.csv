Let's see if Bob is feeling generous!  I'm taking a big chunk, but leaving a little for him in case he wants to play nice.  Let's see what he decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm not thrilled with losing more money, but it's better than getting nothing!  This is a much fairer offer than the one I made in the first round.  Let's see if this round is the end of the game!"
