"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on! I'll have to think carefully. Since the money is worth less with each round, I'd rather get a larger share now. I accept Bob's offer.
