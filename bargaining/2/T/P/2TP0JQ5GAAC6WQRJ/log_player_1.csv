"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, 70-30. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

This way, I get 70% of the initial $100, and Bob gets 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, you can do better than that! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me due to inflation, my gain of 40 is equivalent to 32 in the original money (40 / 0.8 = 50, and 50 * 0.64 = 32).

I don't think I can do better than that, so I'll accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
