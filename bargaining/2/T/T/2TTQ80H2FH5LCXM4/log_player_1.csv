"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need for negotiations""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take this deal! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob thinks I was too generous earlier.

I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject this offer. Considering the inflation, my gain of $4000 is worth 5% less than the $5000 I would have gotten in the first round. However, Bob's gain of $6000 is worth 20% less than the $5000 he would have gotten in the first round.

I'll reject this offer. I think I can do better than this.

Bob's gain of $5000 in the first round is worth $3,918.15 after 3 rounds of inflation.
