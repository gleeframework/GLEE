"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you a decent amount to start""
}
```

This offer gives me 90% of the initial $1,000,000 and leaves Bob with $100,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly. This way, we both get a good amount and avoid the risk of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $500,000 in Round 2 is worth 90% of $500,000, which is $450,000.

I'm not sure if Bob's offer is a good deal for me, considering the inflation effect. Since I'll be getting $450,000, which is less than my initial offer of $900,000, I'll reject Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect, my gain will be worth even less in Round 3. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise""
}
```

In this offer, I'm giving Bob a smaller share, but I'm still trying to be reasonable considering the decreasing value of money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share than before, but I think it's important to avoid further inflation. Let's meet in the middle this time. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values of the money in Round 4, considering the inflation effect.

The original $1,000,000 is now worth 72.9% of its initial value (100% - 27.1% = 72.9%).
My gain of $750,000 in Round 3 would be worth 72.9% of $750,000, which is $547,250.
Bob's offer for Round 4 would give me $400,000, which is worth 72.9% of $400,000, which is $291,600.

Considering the inflation effect, Bob's offer is actually a better deal for me than my original offer in Round 3. I'll accept Bob's offer.
