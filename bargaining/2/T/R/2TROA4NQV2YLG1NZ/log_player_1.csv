Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bit more, considering the inflation is hitting me harder. 
# Alice gain: 420000 
# Bob gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob claims to be compromising, his offer is steadily getting worse for me with each round due to the unequal inflation. It's better to hold out and propose a fairer deal in the next round. Bob's losses are accelerating faster than mine, making him more likely to accept a less favorable deal soon."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. This is a fair split considering the circumstances. Take it before inflation eats away at your potential gains even more.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:**  While I want a larger share, I need to acknowledge Bob's perspective. This offer is a significant drop from my previous proposal, signaling a willingness to compromise.
* **Inflation Pressure:** The message highlights the increasingly dire situation for Bob. The longer this drags on, the less appealing his potential gain becomes. This creates pressure for him to accept.
* **Round Positioning:** This is a strategic point to make a compelling offer.  It's likely Bob is feeling the squeeze of inflation and might be more receptive to a reasonable deal before his position weakens further."
