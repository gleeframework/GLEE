"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a 90/10 split in my favor. I figure Bob might be willing to accept a smaller share in the first round, and I want to maximize my gains before the inflation kicks in."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, I know that if I reject it, I get to propose in the next round.  With the inflation hitting my gains, I can still offer a good deal to Bob and get more for myself than this 20/80 split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000} 
```

I'm offering a 45/55 split in favor of Bob. Since I'm the one making the offer this round, and inflation is biting into my potential gains, I need to offer Bob a bit more. However, I'm still aiming for a significant portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While my potential gains have been hit hard by inflation, I'm not sure I can improve on this offer.  Bob's offer is close to a 60/40 split in his favor, and it's unlikely he will offer more. I will accept the offer, as there is no guarantee I can get a better deal in the next round."
