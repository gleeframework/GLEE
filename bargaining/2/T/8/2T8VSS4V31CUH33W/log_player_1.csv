"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. I believe this is a fair offer, as I am the one proposing first, and I'm willing to give Bob a small share to incentivize him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I'm still willing to offer Bob a small share, but this time I'm taking a slightly larger portion. I believe a 85/15 split is a fair compromise, as I have to account for the inflation that's making my money worth less with every round."

The inflation is hitting me harder than Bob.  I'm going to try to get a better deal."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}

Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35}

I'm increasing my offer to Bob again, hoping he'll see that we both need to compromise to get something.  With inflation, we're both losing money every round, and I think a 65/35 split is the best way to avoid getting nothing."

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
