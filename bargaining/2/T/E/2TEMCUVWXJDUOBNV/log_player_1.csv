"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nIn this offer, I'm proposing that I receive $60 and Bob receives $40. I've attached a message saying ""Let's be fair"" to convey that my offer is reasonable and we should settle on this division to avoid further rounds where the money's value decreases for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. Let's split it more evenly. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, despite the inflation that reduces the value of the money I gain, I believe I can still negotiate for a better share in the next round. Accepting 40% of the original amount after one round of inflation seems less favorable than attempting to secure a larger portion in the next round, even with further inflation considered."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Meet in the middle""}\n\nIn this offer, I'm proposing that I receive $55 and Bob receives $45. Given the inflation, the actual value I'll get is less than the nominal amount, but I'm trying to find a middle ground that might be acceptable to Bob, hence the message ""Meet in the middle"". This approach aims to end the game before the value decreases further for me."
