"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, and see how it goes from here.""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start, giving each of us $5000. This way, we can both get a decent chunk of the money and see how the game unfolds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 4000, but I want a bit more for myself since I'm the one making the offer this time. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I'll consider it. Since I'm getting 40% of the total, I'll have to think carefully about whether it's worth rejecting and risking getting nothing.

For now, I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
