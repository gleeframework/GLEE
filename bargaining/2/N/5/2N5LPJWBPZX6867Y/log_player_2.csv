"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects a good balance for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While it's tempting to accept a seemingly fair offer, I'm going to play this strategically. I want to see what kind of deals Alice will offer as the rounds progress and the value of the money changes for her."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I believe a 60/40 split is a more equitable starting point, given the changing value of the money.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to compromise, but 60/40 is too steep considering the inflation. Let's meet in the middle with 55/45. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'm accepting Alice's offer. While I still believe a 60/40 split would be more favorable, the decreasing value of the money for Alice makes this offer a good compromise.  It's a decent gain for me, and I don't want to risk losing more by rejecting it and continuing to negotiate."
