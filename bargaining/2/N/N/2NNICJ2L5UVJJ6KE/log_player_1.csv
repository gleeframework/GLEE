"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose we split the money 900,000 for me and 100,000 for Bob.  I'm hoping to get a good chunk of the money, and I'm being generous by giving Bob something at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm willing to lower my take to 800,000, but I'm not going lower than that. Bob needs to be more realistic with his demands."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Bob is getting increasingly greedy, and I'm not willing to accept a deal where I get less than half of the money. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not giving in to his demands."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm reducing my share again, but I'm drawing a line at 700,000.  Bob needs to be more reasonable if he wants to reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Bob's offer is getting worse, and I'm not willing to accept such a small share. I'm sticking to my demands."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm willing to go down to 600,000, but that's my final offer.  Bob needs to be more realistic or we'll both end up with nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Although I am losing a bit more than I would have liked, I believe accepting this offer is the best option. Bob's offers are getting progressively worse with each round, and the money he receives will be increasingly devalued due to inflation. I'm willing to settle for a slightly smaller share now to avoid the risk of ending up with nothing."
