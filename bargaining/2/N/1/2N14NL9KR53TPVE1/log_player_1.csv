"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'm actually gaining 4,750 (4000 / 0.95). Meanwhile, Bob is gaining 6000, which is 20% less than his original 7500, so he's gaining 6000.

I'll decide to reject this offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round. 

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll make a new offer. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the previous round, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the inflation. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

I'm proposing a slightly biased split in my favor to account for the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts considering the inflation:

My gain is 14.26% less than the original 5000, so I'm gaining 4270 (5000 / 0.8526).

Bob's gain is 48.8% less than the original 6000, so he's gaining 3104 (6000 / 0.5184).

I'll decide to reject this offer, as I'm not getting a good deal considering the inflation.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the increasing inflation, I'll make a new offer. Since the money I gain is worth 14.26% less than in the previous round, I'll aim to get an even larger share to compensate for the inflation. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm proposing a more biased split in my favor to account for the increasing inflation."
