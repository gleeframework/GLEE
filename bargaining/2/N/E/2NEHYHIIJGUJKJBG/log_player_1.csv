I propose taking 999,999 dollars and giving Bob 1 dollar.  It's unlikely he'll accept, but I'm starting with a very strong position!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'll accept.  While I'd prefer more, I'm not sure how many rounds it'll take to get a better offer.  It's better to take $400,000 now than risk getting nothing later."
