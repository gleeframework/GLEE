"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  This is a good starting point as it ensures I get the majority of the money, but it's still fair to Bob. We'll see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse for me than my initial proposal. Even with the inflation, a 30/70 split is not a good deal. I will reject and make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a compromise from my previous offer, but still gives me a good portion of the money. Hopefully, Bob will see that this is a more fair deal than his previous offer, especially given the effects of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still worse for me than my initial proposal. While inflation has impacted the value of the money, it's still not a good deal to accept a 45/55 split. I will reject and make another counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

Given the significant impact of inflation, I think it's time for a compromise. I'm offering an even 50/50 split, which is the fairest option at this point.  It's a risk, but I'm hoping Bob will see the value in ending the game and avoiding further losses due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still not favorable to me, even with the significant inflation.  While a 40/60 split might have been acceptable in earlier rounds, the current inflation makes it a worse deal than my previous offer.  I will reject and attempt to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000}
```

I'm going to offer a 45/55 split. This is a slight concession from my previous offer, but I believe it's necessary to reach an agreement with Bob. The inflation is hurting us both significantly, and I'm hopeful that Bob will realize this and accept my offer."
