"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

This is a fair and equal split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain is now worth less. I'd rather not accept a lower share than I proposed initially. I'll reject Bob's offer.

}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money. I'll aim for a higher share to compensate for the loss in value.

  ""bob_gain"": 45
}"

# Bob gain: 38 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the money is worth even less now. I'll consider Bob's offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll think carefully...
