  ""bob_gain"": 5000,

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to start the game."

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal. You can't do better than this. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering the inflation, I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal. But Bob seems confident that I won't do better.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a counteroffer that takes into account the inflation. Since the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, I'll aim for a slightly higher share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation. This is my best offer so far.""
}
```"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not getting taken advantage of. This is my final offer for now. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection! Bob is being stubborn, but I'll think carefully about this offer. Considering the inflation, I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal. But Bob seems confident that I won't do better.

However, I notice that Bob's offer is similar to his previous one, and I'm not sure if he's trying to gauge my reaction or if he's genuinely willing to compromise. I'll take a chance and reject this offer, hoping that Bob will come back with a better proposal.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a new offer that takes into account the significant inflation that has occurred. Since the money is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I'll aim for an even higher share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking a risk, but I think I deserve a larger share considering the inflation. This is my best offer so far.""

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking a risk by giving you a smaller share, but I think I'm still getting a good deal. Don't expect any better from me. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to squeeze me out. With the inflation taking a significant toll on the money's value, I'm not sure if I'm getting a fair deal. However, I also don't want to risk going into the next round with an even lower value of money.

Considering the current state of the game, I think I'll accept Bob's offer. It's not ideal, but it's the best I can get at this point.
