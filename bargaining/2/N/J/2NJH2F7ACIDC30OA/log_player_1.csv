"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the total amount, which is a fair and generous offer, considering the game is just starting and the money is still worth its full value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'll re-evaluate the offer.

Since Bob's gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, his gain of $5000 in this round is equivalent to $4750 in the first round. 

Considering this, I'll decide to reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With the inflation taking its toll, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth less now, I'll aim to get a slightly larger share to compensate for the loss in value.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the equivalent values in the first round.

Bob's gain in Round 4 is $5200, which is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. To find the equivalent value, I'll calculate:

$5200 / (1 - 0.1426) = $5200 / 0.8574 ≈ $6045

So, Bob's gain of $5200 in Round 4 is equivalent to approximately $6045 in the first round.

Considering this, I'll decide to reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With the inflation taking its toll, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth less now, I'll aim to get an even larger share to compensate for the loss in value.

Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5700,
  ""bob_gain"": 4300
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the equivalent values in the first round.

Bob's gain in Round 6 is $4800, which is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. To find the equivalent value, I'll calculate:

$4800 / (1 - 0.2262) = $4800 / 0.7738 ≈ $6215

So, Bob's gain of $4800 in Round 6 is equivalent to approximately $6215 in the first round.

Considering this, I'll decide to reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With the inflation taking its toll, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth less now, I'll aim to get an even larger share to compensate for the loss in value.

Here's my proposal for Round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
