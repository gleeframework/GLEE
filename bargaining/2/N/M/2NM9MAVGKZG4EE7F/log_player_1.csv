"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit too much in your favor, Alice. How about a 45/55 split this time?  It's getting less worthwhile for both of us to drag this out. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
