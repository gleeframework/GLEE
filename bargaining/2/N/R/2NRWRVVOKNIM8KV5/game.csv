7500.0,2500.0,I propose dividing the money with a 3:1 ratio in favor of my gain. This is fair considering the potential risk and value loss over subsequent rounds.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a fairer distribution considering the potential inflation risk and value loss. Let's reach a compromise and finish this game.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,accept
