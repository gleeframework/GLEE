Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is sticking very close to a 60/40 split in her favor.  While her offer is getting ""better"",  the pace is too slow. The inflation rate means that accepting a bad deal later is worse than holding out for a better split, even with the risk of getting nothing. I need to signal I'm willing to risk it all for a fairer outcome."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is ridiculous.  I'm proposing a perfectly even split to end this pointless negotiation. Take it or leave it, but the pot shrinks every round.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

A firm stance is needed.  Alice will likely not accept this offer, but it strongly signals that I'm willing to let the money burn to get a fair deal. This drastically increases the pressure on her in the following rounds.  She'll be forced to either concede to a more even split or risk everything herself."
