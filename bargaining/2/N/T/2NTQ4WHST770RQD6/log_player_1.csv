"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a 60-40 split, with me receiving $600,000 and Bob receiving $400,000. I've attached a message that says ""Let's split fairly"" to convey a sense of cooperation and fairness. Since the money is worth 5% less for me with each passing round, I want to try to reach an agreement quickly to minimize the impact of inflation. I'm hoping Bob will see the reasonableness of my offer and accept it, ending the game in the first round."

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm aiming for a more balanced split this time. Let's settle this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Although the money is worth 5% less for me in this round, I believe I can get a better deal. Bob's offer of a 45-55 split is less favorable to me than my initial offer, and I'm not willing to accept it. I'll try to negotiate for a better split in the next round.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nNow it's my turn again. I'll make a new offer to Bob.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 575000, ""bob_gain"": 425000, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\n###\n\nI've offered a 57.5-42.5 split, which is closer to the middle ground. My message ""Meet me in the middle"" conveys my willingness to compromise and find a mutually acceptable solution. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a fair offer considering the time pressure and inflation working against you, Alice. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Although the money is worth 14.26% less for me in this round, I believe I can still get a better deal. Bob's offer of a 47.5-52.5 split is not significantly better than his previous offer, and I'm not willing to accept it. I'll try to negotiate for a better split in the next round, considering the increasing impact of inflation.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nNow it's my turn again. I'll make a new offer to Bob.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 562500, ""bob_gain"": 437500, ""message"": ""Consider the bigger picture""}\n\n###\n\nI've offered a 56.25-43.75 split, which is still a compromise but slightly more favorable to me. My message ""Consider the bigger picture"" aims to make Bob think about the overall outcome and the potential benefits of accepting my offer, rather than focusing solely on the numbers.\n\nLet's see if Bob will accept this offer."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I had already sent my offer for round 5 along with my rejection of Bob's offer in round 4. Here it is again for clarity:\n\n{""alice_gain"": 562500, ""bob_gain"": 437500, ""message"": ""Consider the bigger picture""}\n\n###\n\nI'm hoping that by offering a compromise and encouraging Bob to consider the bigger picture, he will see the reasonableness of my proposal and accept it, ending the game in round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be realistic. The longer this goes on, the less appealing your share becomes. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 490000 
# Bob gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll accept Bob's offer. Although the money is worth 22.62% less for me in this round, I believe Bob's offer of a 49-51 split is the best deal I can get considering the significant impact of inflation. Bob's message implies that this is his final offer, and I don't want to risk losing even more value by rejecting it and prolonging the game. I'll accept the offer and end the game in round 6.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nBy accepting Bob's offer, I'll receive $490,000, which is worth less than my initial offer but still a substantial amount. I've tried to negotiate for a better deal throughout the game, but the increasing pressure of inflation has limited my bargaining power. I'm satisfied with the outcome, considering the circumstances."
