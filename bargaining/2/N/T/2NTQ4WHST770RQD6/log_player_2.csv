Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to a more even split, it's important to remember that inflation is working heavily in my favor.  Alice is losing value with each round that passes. By continuing to reject offers that don't favor me significantly, I increase the pressure on her to make a better deal before the perceived value of her share diminishes too greatly."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 510000, ""alice_gain"": 490000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. The longer this goes on, the less appealing your share becomes. This is my final offer.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This offer is a strategic balance:

* **Slight Advantage:** It still favors me, reflecting the advantageous position inflation puts me in.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  The ""final offer"" statement aims to add pressure on Alice.
* **Potential for Agreement:** It's close enough to a 50/50 split that Alice might be willing to accept to avoid further losses due to inflation."
