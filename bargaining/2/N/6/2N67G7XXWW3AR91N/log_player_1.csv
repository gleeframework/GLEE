"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm starting with a somewhat aggressive offer, keeping 90% for myself. This leaves Bob with a small share, but I want to see if he's willing to accept a deal that heavily favors me in the early rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a fair and equal split, and I don't want to risk losing any more money to inflation.  It's better to take the 50/50 split now than to risk getting nothing later."
