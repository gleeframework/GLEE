"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm Bob, and I want to see if I can get a better deal!  Let's see what Alice offers next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's flip the script,  I'll take 600k, you get 400k. It's a fair trade, wouldn't you say?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You had your chance, now it's my turn again. Considering the inflation, this is more than fair. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more,  accepting this offer is the best choice.  The inflation is hitting hard, and I'm not sure I can get a better deal in the next round."
