Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

This is a very aggressive first offer, but given the inflation and the fact that Bob's money is worth 20% less each round, I think it's a strong starting point.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

This offer is much worse for me than my initial offer.  Even though I'm losing 5% of my money's value each round,  it's still too early to accept such a low share. I'll see what he offers next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I'm increasing my share slightly again.  I need to be assertive early on to make sure I get a fair share.  Let's see if Bob is willing to budge."
