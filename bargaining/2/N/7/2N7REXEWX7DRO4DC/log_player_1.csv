"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\n###\n\nAs Alice, I'm proposing a division where I receive $6000 and Bob receives $4000. I'm hoping that by framing this as a ""fair"" offer, Bob will be more inclined to accept it, especially considering that the value of the money decreases for him with each passing round. This initial offer gives me a slight advantage, but it's not so skewed that it would be immediately rejected. I'm curious to see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, despite the inflation affecting his gain, I believe I can negotiate for a better split. In the previous round, I proposed a 60-40 split in my favor, and now Bob is offering a 55-45 split in his favor. Given that the value of the money hasn't changed for me, I'm willing to take the risk of proceeding to the next round to try and secure a more favorable division. Additionally, since the inflation only affects Bob's gain, I have more negotiating power in this round. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to try and reach a more favorable agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a generous offer""}\n\nIn this round, I'm making a slightly more aggressive offer than my initial one, taking into account the fact that the value of the money hasn't changed for me, but has decreased by 10% for Bob in each of the previous rounds. By offering a 58-42 split in my favor, I'm still being somewhat generous considering the inflation, but also pushing for a better deal. The message is designed to make Bob feel like he's getting a relatively good offer, despite the split being less favorable to him than his previous proposal. I'm hoping that Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed."
