"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a proposal that gives me a decent chunk of the money, but not so much that Bob will reject it outright.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, the effective amounts are:

Alice's gain: 6000 * 0.9 = 5400 (due to 10% less value)
Bob's gain: 4000 * 0.95 = 3800 (due to 5% less value)

Bob's offer is 5000 for both of us, which is less than my effective gain of 5400. I'll reject this offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, the effective amount is now worth 90% of the previous round's value (0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81).

My new proposal is:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the effective amounts considering the inflation:

Alice's gain: 6000 * (0.9)^3 = 6000 * 0.729 = 4374.6 (due to 27.1% less value)
Bob's gain: 4000 * (0.95)^2 = 4000 * 0.9025 = 3609 (due to 14.26% less value)

Bob's offer is 4000 for me, which is less than my effective gain of 4374.6. I'll reject this offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, the effective amount is now worth 72.9% of the first round's value (0.9^4 = 0.6561).

My new proposal is:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""bob_gain"": 6000
}"
