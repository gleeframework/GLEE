"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can seal the deal!""
}
```

This way, I get 80% of the initial amount, and Bob gets 20%. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, Alice. Let's split it 50/50 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my calculation. In this round, the total amount is 9,000 (10,000 * 0.9), and Bob's offer is to split it 50/50.

I'll accept Bob's offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
