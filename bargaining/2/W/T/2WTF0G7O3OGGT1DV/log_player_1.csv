"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer and message to Bob in JSON format:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""
}
```

In this offer, I propose that I receive $600,000 and Bob receives $400,000, with the message ""Let's split fairly"". I'm starting with a relatively even split, but slightly biased in my favor to leave room for negotiation. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering the inflation rates. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
