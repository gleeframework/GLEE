I'm proposing a 90/10 split, as I am confident I can convince Bob to accept this offer. It's fair, as the value of my share is significantly greater in the next round, while his share decreases much faster."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm offering a 80/20 split in my favor. Bob's offer in the previous round was way too low, and I am confident I can get him to accept this offer.  Since his money is losing value much faster than mine, this is a good deal for him."
