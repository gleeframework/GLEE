This is a tough spot.  While accepting a 60/40 split feels unfair, it's important to consider the larger context:

* **Inflation:**  The longer this goes on, the less my share is actually worth. Accepting now cuts my losses.
* **Bob's Stance:** He seems unwilling to budge much further. Holding out for a slightly better deal in Round 7 risks him becoming even more stubborn.

A guaranteed $4,000 is better than risking an even worse outcome later."
