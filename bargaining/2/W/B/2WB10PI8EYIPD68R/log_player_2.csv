Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation difference, I'm being more than fair 
# Bob gain: 4200

Alice's offer is getting closer to something acceptable, but I believe I can still negotiate a better deal in the next few rounds."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting a bad deal due to inflation, I'm willing to compromise a bit 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This offer is barely better than my last, but the significant inflation working against me makes it risky to push further. Accepting now locks in a reasonable amount before it diminishes further."
