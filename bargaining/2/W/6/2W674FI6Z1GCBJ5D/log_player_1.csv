"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a bold move. Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting already!

I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'd rather not accept an offer that gives me less than I would have gotten in the first round. I'll reject this offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher share this time. Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}"
