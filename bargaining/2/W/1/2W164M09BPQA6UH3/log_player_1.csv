"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you 40% of the initial amount. Let's start the game!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a larger share, but I'm willing to compromise. Your turn to decide! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","After the first round, the money is worth 80% of its original value, so the amounts are:

* Alice gain: 2000 * 0.8 = 1600
* Bob gain: 8000 * 0.8 = 6400

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept such a low share. I'll make a new offer in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to give away too much. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,500 and keeping $5,500 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you in the middle this time. Your turn to decide! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","After the first round, the money is worth 80% of its original value, and after the second round, it's worth 80% of that, which is 64% of the original value. After the third round, it's worth 64% of that, which is 40.96% of the original value.

So, the amounts in round 4 are:

* Alice gain: 4500 * 0.4096 = 1843.52
* Bob gain: 5500 * 0.4096 = 2251.68

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer, as it's a reasonable compromise."
