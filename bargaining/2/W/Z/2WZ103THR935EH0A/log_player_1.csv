"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you a decent amount to get us started.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is 20% of the total, and I'll take the remaining $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share since the money is worth less now 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth less now, so I'll have to be more careful with my decision.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think I can do better than this."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 10% less than in Round 1. I'll make a new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,500, which is 45% of the total, and I'll take the remaining $5,500."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you in the middle and make it a 50/50 split 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","A 50/50 split sounds reasonable, especially considering the money is worth less now.

I'll accept Bob's offer from Round 4.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
