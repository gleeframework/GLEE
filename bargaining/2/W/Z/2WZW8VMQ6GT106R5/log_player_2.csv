Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's compromise. I'm willing to go down to 6000, but I need more than 4500.  We're losing money with each round. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm willing to negotiate, but I still think a 55/45 split is fair. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."
