"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 70-30, seems fair to me. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or reject the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60/40 is a fairer split, considering inflation will affect us both differently. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effects of inflation, I think Bob's 60-40 split is a bit more favorable to him than I initially proposed. However, I'm willing to accept a slightly less favorable split to avoid further rounds and the continued erosion of the money's value.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
