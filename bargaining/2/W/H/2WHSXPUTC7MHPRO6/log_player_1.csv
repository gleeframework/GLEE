"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 20% of the total. You can try to do better next round.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is 20% of the initial $10,000. This is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will try to do better next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to divide the money. Let's not get greedy and end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less after the first round, the effective amount I would gain in this round is 80% of $5,000, which is $4,000.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not sure if it's the best option for me. I'd rather try to negotiate for more. However, I also don't want to risk going to the 12th round and ending up with nothing.

I'll reject this offer for now and try to do better next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 20% less after the second round, the effective amount I would gain in this round is 80% of the remaining $5,000, which is $4,000. But I'll make a new offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""You could have taken the 50/50 split in the last round. Now, I'm offering you $4,000. You can try to do better next round.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is 40% of the remaining $10,000. Let's see if he'll accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think a 60/40 split is fair considering we both rejected offers in the last round.  Let's get this over with. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 48.8% less after the third round, the effective amount I would gain in this round is 51.2% of the remaining $5,000, which is approximately $2,560.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I'm also not eager to risk going to the 12th round and ending up with nothing. I'll accept this offer, as it's a relatively decent split.
