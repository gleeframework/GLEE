"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal. I propose taking $7,000 while you take $3,000.  A fair offer considering the inflation will only hurt you more as time passes.

Round 3

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want a good deal. I'm proposing $6,500 for me and $3,500 for you.  This is better than my last offer and still safeguards you against another round of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500
