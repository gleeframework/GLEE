I'm going to start with a pretty generous offer to Bob, hoping to end the game quickly.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a classic example of the ultimatum game, and it's a fascinating demonstration of how people value fairness.  Bob's offer is clearly unfair, even with the inflation factored in. I'm going to reject this and see if we can reach a more balanced agreement in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a slightly smaller share, but still a significant amount, in hopes of striking a compromise.  I'm willing to give up a little more than I did in the first round, but I want to ensure I still get a reasonable amount of the money."
