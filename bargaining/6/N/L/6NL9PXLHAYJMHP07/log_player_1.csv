"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, I'm being fair! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it.

Since the money is worth 20% less, I'll need to adjust my thinking. In this round, the total amount is worth $8,000 (80% of the original $10,000).

Bob's offer is:

* Alice gets $4,000 (50% of the new value)
* Bob gets $6,000 (75% of the new value)

I'll decide to...

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, with each of us getting $5,000."
