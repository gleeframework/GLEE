"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money 60/40.  It's a fair deal for the first round. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm Bob, and I'm going to try to get a better deal than 40/60.  Let's see if I can get Alice to budge a bit!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is fairer, considering the inflation we both face. Let's be reasonable and move forward.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but the inflation affects me more. Let's settle this with a 55/45 split in my favor. Time is running out. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though I would prefer a better deal for myself, time is running out and I don't want to risk getting nothing.  I'll accept this offer."
