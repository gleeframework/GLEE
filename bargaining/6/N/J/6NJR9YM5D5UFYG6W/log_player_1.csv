"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, Alice. This way, we both get a fair share and avoid any further losses due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""The deal is getting worse for you, Bob. Inflation is eating your share! Take this offer before it shrinks even more.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to concede a bit more to avoid further losses from inflation. This offer is fair considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is getting better, but it's still in his favor.  He's feeling the pressure of inflation more than I am. I'm willing to gamble that he'll offer an even better deal in the next round to avoid losing more value."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
