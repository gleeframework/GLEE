Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}

This is a fairly generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it to get the game over with!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Considering the inflation effect, my gain of 5000$ is worth 90% of the original 6000$, and Bob's gain of 5000$ is worth 80% of the original 4000$. I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal, but I'll take it to avoid further negotiations.
