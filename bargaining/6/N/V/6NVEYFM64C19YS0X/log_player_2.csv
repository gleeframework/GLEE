Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is money, and we're both losing out. I'm proposing a compromise that still considers the inflation but gets us both a good deal. Let's close this before the value drops further. 
# Bob gain: 498000 
# Alice gain: 502000
