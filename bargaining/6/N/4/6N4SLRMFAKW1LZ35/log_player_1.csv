# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer. Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I think I can get a better deal in the next round. Let's see what happens next!"

# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer. Although the money is losing value quickly, I think I can still get a better deal. Since Bob is losing value faster than me, I'll try to take advantage of that in the next round. Let's see what happens next!"
