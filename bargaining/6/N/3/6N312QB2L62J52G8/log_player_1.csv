"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40. I think we can trust each other.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a fair and reasonable offer, considering the initial amount of $10,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can wrap up the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 65-35 split is fairer. Let's avoid going back and forth, and finish this. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth less due to inflation, I need to be more cautious with my decision.

I'm not thrilled about the 65-35 split, as it's a bit skewed towards Bob's favor. However, I don't want to prolong the game and risk losing even more value due to inflation.

I'll accept Bob's offer, hoping that it's the best I can get.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
