"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you a decent amount, but I'm hoping to get the majority.""
}
```

This way, I'm giving Bob a relatively small amount, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not willing to give up too much yet. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain is now worth 5% less than before. Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I want to give up that much. I'm hoping for a better deal.""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and hope to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, I'll aim for a slightly higher percentage of the remaining amount. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while.""
}
```

This way, I'm trying to increase my share, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still think I deserve a bit more. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking its toll, and my potential gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round! Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""I suppose meeting halfway is a reasonable compromise, given the circumstances.""
}
```

I'll accept this offer, hoping that it's the best I can get."
