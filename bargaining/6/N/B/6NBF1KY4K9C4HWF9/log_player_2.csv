Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is fair, given the inflation factor. Let's end this quickly.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's my turn to propose now, and the clock is ticking for both of us. I'm willing to compromise slightly, but I still need a bit over half to account for the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 490000 
# Alice gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
