"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

This is a generous offer, considering I'm giving Bob a third of the total. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The stakes are getting higher! With inflation, my potential gain is worth even less now. However, Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, which is a fair one. I'll decide to accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
