Let's see if Bob takes my generous offer!"

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting, I'm not giving up 90% of the money just yet. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal.  Let's see what happens in round 3!"

Round 3

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share this round.  Inflation is starting to bite, and I want to ensure I get a decent portion.  Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm still holding out! Inflation is taking its toll, but I'm not going to settle for such a low amount just yet.  I'm sure I can do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000} 
```

This time, I'm proposing an even split.  With inflation biting into our potential gains, I think a fair split is the best option.  Let's see what Bob says."
