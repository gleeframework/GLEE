"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can discuss further if you don't like this.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your fairness, but I believe I deserve a larger share.  Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to reverse the offer from the first round. I'll have to be careful with the inflation in mind.

Since the money is worth 20% less for me, I'd be gaining $320,000 in this proposal, and Bob would be gaining $540,000.

I'll reject this offer, as I'd be giving up too much value due to the inflation.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll have to be more aggressive with my offer. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I need to make sure I get a decent amount to account for the inflation.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, and keeping $700,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the impact of inflation, but I need to secure a larger portion to make this worthwhile. Let's try a more balanced approach. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to flip the script again.

Considering the inflation, I'd be gaining $300,000, but it's worth 48.8% less than the original $600,000 I was aiming for. That's a significant hit.

On the other hand, Bob would be gaining $700,000, but it's worth 27.1% less than the original $900,000 he was aiming for. That's still a decent amount, but I'm not sure if it's enough for him.

I'll reject this offer, as I'd be giving up too much value due to the inflation.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll have to be even more aggressive with my offer, considering the inflation. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting worried about the inflation, so I need to secure a larger share to make this worthwhile.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000, and keeping $800,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: While I understand your concern about inflation, I need a more equitable share.  Let's find a middle ground that considers both our needs. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to flip the script again.

Considering the inflation, I'd be gaining $200,000, but it's worth 67.23% less than the original $600,000 I was aiming for. That's a huge hit.

On the other hand, Bob would be gaining $800,000, but it's worth 40.95% less than the original $1,333,333.33 he was aiming for. That's still a significant amount, but I'm not sure if it's enough for him.

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll have to be very aggressive with my offer, considering the inflation is getting out of control. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""I'm running out of patience, I need to secure a large share to protect my interests.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, and keeping $900,000 for myself. This is my last chance to get a decent share before the money becomes almost worthless due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: With inflation hitting us both hard, I'm making a final attempt at a fair split.  We need to compromise to avoid losing everything. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to make a final push for a compromise.

Considering the inflation, I'd be gaining $100,000, but it's worth 79.03% less than the original $600,000 I was aiming for. That's a massive hit.

On the other hand, Bob would be gaining $900,000, but it's worth 52.17% less than the original $1,900,000 he was aiming for. That's still a significant amount, and it's the largest share he's offered so far.

I'll accept this offer, as it's the best I can get at this point, and I'd rather take a smaller share than risk losing everything due to inflation.
