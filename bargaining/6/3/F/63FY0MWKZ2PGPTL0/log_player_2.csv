Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects the urgency for both of us to secure a good portion of the money before inflation eats away at it.

# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I believe this split is more equitable considering the inflation rate.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. This offer still gives you a significant sum while acknowledging that I face a higher inflation rate. Accepting now is better than risking further losses for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
