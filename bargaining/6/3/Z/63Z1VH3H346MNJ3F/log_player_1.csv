Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer. It's the same split you wanted, but adjusted for the decreasing value of the money.  Let's be practical and end this.

# Bob gain: 60

The money has devalued significantly, and while not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in round 4 is the best move at this point. Here's why:

* **Time Value of Money:**  Due to the aggressive inflation, delaying further will only erode the value of the potential winnings for both of us. 
* **Bob's Final Offer:** His message implies he is unlikely to budge further. Rejecting this offer risks walking away with nothing if he sticks to his word in future rounds.
* **Minimizing Losses:** While 40 is less than the initial offer, it's still a reasonable sum considering the circumstances. 

It's a tough decision, but in a game with rapidly decreasing payoffs, sometimes accepting the best available option, even if not perfect, is the most rational choice.
