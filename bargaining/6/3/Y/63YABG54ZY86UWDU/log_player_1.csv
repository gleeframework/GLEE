"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, giving me the majority of the initial $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since Bob's offer is a 40-60 split, and the money is worth less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
