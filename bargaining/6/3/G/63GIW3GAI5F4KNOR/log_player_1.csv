Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

While I'd prefer a slightly better split, accepting a 50/50 offer now makes the most sense. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  With each round, the value of the money significantly decreases. Accepting now guarantees a reasonable amount. 
* **Risk:** If I reject this offer, Bob might propose something worse in the next round, and I'll be forced to accept even less due to inflation. 
* **Fairness:**  While not ideal, a 50/50 split is fair, and holding out for a significantly larger share might make Bob less willing to negotiate fairly."
