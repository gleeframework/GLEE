I'm going to reject this offer. Even though it's a fairly even split, I want to see if I can get a better deal. I'm confident I can do better, considering the inflation is working in my favor more than Alice's."

I'm still going to reject. While the offer is slightly better for me than the previous one, I'm still confident that I can get a better deal. The inflation is working in my favor, and I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can secure a more favorable split."

Even though the inflation is hitting me harder now, this is a good offer, and I don't want to risk losing everything.  I'm accepting."
