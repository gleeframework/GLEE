Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to meet you halfway here. This is a very slight advantage for me, and it's the best I can do with inflation looming. 
# Bob gain: 495000 
# Alice gain: 505000

This is a tough one!  Here's why I'm leaning towards accepting, even though it's slightly in Alice's favor:

* **Inflation:**  The longer this goes on, the more Alice loses. However, this also puts pressure on me to take a deal sooner rather than later.
* **Future Uncertainty:** There's no guarantee I can get a better deal in future rounds. Alice might become even more resistant to giving me a larger share.
* **Decent Offer:** While not ideal, getting $495,000 is still a significant amount of money. 

It's a gamble either way, but accepting now minimizes potential losses for both of us.
