"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the original 100$, which is $40. I'll take the remaining 60%, which is $60."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering you got the better end of the deal last round. Let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 10% less, so the actual amounts are:

* My gain: 40 * 0.9 = 36
* Bob's gain: 60 * 0.9 = 54

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this offer, considering the initial proposal I made was a fair one. I think I should get more, considering the initial offer I made was already a 60/40 split in favor of Bob.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation has reduced the value of the money, I'll aim for a slightly higher percentage to make up for it. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55/45 is a more reasonable split given the current market conditions.""
}
```"
