"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor, which is a generous offer considering the inflation factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to start. Let's see if we can agree. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","A 50/50 split is a fair offer, and it's a good compromise considering the inflation factor. I'll accept the offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
