Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a very aggressive offer, hoping to get most of the money right away.  If Bob rejects, I'll have to be more reasonable in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It's better to take the 50/50 split now. While I'd like more, there's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in the future, and there's always the risk of getting nothing at all."
