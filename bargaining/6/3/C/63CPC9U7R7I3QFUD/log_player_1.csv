"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a generous offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can both get a good portion of the money.  I'm leaving a good chunk for him in hopes he'll see the value in taking it now rather than risking inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred a larger share, the value of my potential earnings is decreasing rapidly due to inflation. Accepting this offer guarantees me a decent portion of the money, and it's better than risking getting nothing at all in the later rounds."
