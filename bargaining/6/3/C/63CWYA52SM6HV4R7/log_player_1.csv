"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $250,000 and keeping $750,000 for myself. The message is a friendly one, suggesting we can settle on a fair split without further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a fair share, but I'm also aiming for a better outcome for myself.  Let's see if you're open to a compromise. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking its toll!

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about giving up a larger share, but I'm willing to compromise. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to negotiate further. Can we aim for a more balanced split?""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer for now, hoping we can find a more balanced split that works for both of us."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth 40% less now due to inflation!

Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle. Let's make a deal.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $450,000 and keeping $550,000 for myself. The message is a friendly one, suggesting we can find common ground and make a deal."
