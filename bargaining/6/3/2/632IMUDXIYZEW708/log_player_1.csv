"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

This means I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my strategy. Given the offer, I'll decide to reject it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the decreasing value of money due to inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes this into account. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}

This time, I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still trying to maximize my own gain."
