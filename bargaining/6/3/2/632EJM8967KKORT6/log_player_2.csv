Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation to her advantage. I need to hold firm and hope she starts taking the decreasing value seriously soon."

# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a tough decision, but with the inflation eating into my share so severely, I need to cut my losses. Alice is unlikely to budge much further, and the longer this goes on, the less I'll get. Accepting 44 now is better than risking even less in future rounds."
