Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice rejected my offer of 30$, I'll try to get a better deal. Here's my offer for Round 2:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is hitting me hard! Okay, let me calculate the effective value of the offer...

Since the money I gain is worth 36% less than in the first round, and I would have gained 30$ in the first round, I would effectively gain 30 * 0.64 = 19.2$ in this round.

Similarly, since the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round, and she would have gained 70$ in the first round, she would effectively gain 70 * 0.81 = 56.7$ in this round.

Hmm, this offer is a bit better than the first one, but still not great. I'll try to do better. Here's my decision:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Inflation is still affecting me, but I'll try to make a better offer. Since I rejected the previous offer, I'll try to get a bit more. Here's my new offer:

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}"
