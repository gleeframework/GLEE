"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 50/50 to start, a fair and simple beginning! 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's tempting to accept a 50/50 split, but there's a lot of time left in the game. I'm going to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to offer you 40% of the money, which is a fair starting point considering inflation could affect the value of the money later. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share, but I still want to keep a decent amount for myself. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

Alice is willing to give me a larger share, and while I still want more, the risk of losing everything due to inflation is too high. I'll take the 550,000 and hope Alice will be happy with her 450,000."
