"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you 20% now, and we can reassess later if needed.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself, which is a 20% share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I'm still not sure if it's fair. Let's see if you'll take it. 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my $8,000 from the first round is now worth 90% of its original value, which is $7,200. Bob's offer is still a bit too low, considering the reduced value of money.

I'll reject this offer.
