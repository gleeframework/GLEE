# Bob's message: I think a 55-45 split is more fair, considering the inflation we'll face in the next round.  Let's be reasonable and finish this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not convinced that a 55-45 split is the best deal for me. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better split.
