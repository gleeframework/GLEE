"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. It's a generous offer considering I'm taking the risk of being rejected and having to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my initial proposal, and with inflation, the value of his offer has decreased even further. I'm not willing to accept such a drastic reduction.  I'll take my chances with the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I'm willing to compromise slightly from my initial offer. I'm offering 85% to myself, 15% to Bob.  I'm hoping this is reasonable enough to reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 750000 
# Bob gain: 250000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the value of Bob's offer has decreased due to inflation, it's still significantly more than what I'd receive if we continue to negotiate. Accepting this deal is a compromise, but it ensures I get a substantial portion of the money and avoids the risk of getting nothing at all."
