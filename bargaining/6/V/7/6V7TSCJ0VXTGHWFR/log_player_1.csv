"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was tempting, but let's be realistic. I'm willing to take on a bit more risk in the next round, so this split seems fairer to me. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
