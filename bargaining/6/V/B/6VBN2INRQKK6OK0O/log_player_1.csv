I propose taking $9,000 for myself and giving Bob $1,000. It's a pretty hefty offer considering the inflation.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I'd love to get more, it's better to accept this 50/50 split.  With the inflation, my gains are significantly less, and it's unlikely I'll get a better offer in the next round. It's time to take the sure thing!"
