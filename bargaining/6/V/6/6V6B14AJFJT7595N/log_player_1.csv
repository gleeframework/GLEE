Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly, I'll take 60% and you can have 40%. It's better to get something than nothing, and we both get a good amount.""}"

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your turn Alice. I'm feeling generous, but let's not drag this out.  A 55/45 split seems fair considering the time pressure. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
