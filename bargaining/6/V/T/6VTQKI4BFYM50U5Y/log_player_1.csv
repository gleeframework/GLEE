"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 
 
I propose a 99-1 split in my favor. It's a bit aggressive, but I want to see if Bob is willing to accept a small share to avoid getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
A 50-50 split is fair, and I'd rather get something than risk getting nothing in the later rounds."
