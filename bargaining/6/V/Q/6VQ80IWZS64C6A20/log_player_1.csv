"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a relatively fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split, taking into account the potential for inflation. Let's be reasonable and get this done. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I'm not as optimistic about the future value of my gains as Bob is. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Given the inflation effect, I'll be more cautious and try to secure a larger share of the initial $10,000. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think I need a larger share to break even. Can you meet me in the middle?""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've considered your concerns about inflation, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's end this game with a reasonable split. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to get me to accept a similar offer to the one I made in round 1, but with a slightly lower value due to inflation. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Given the significant reduction in the value of Bob's offer due to inflation, I'll try to take advantage of the situation and make a more aggressive proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation has eaten into Bob's offer, I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I need a bigger piece of the pie to compensate for the reduced value.""
}
```"
