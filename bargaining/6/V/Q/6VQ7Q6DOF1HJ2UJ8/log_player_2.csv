"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and avoid too many rounds. A 52.5/47.5 split seems reasonable. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see if I can do better."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering the inflation rate. Let's end this quickly.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's stop wasting time.  A 50/50 split is the fairest and most efficient outcome.  Each round that passes hurts us both. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Let's get this done.  A 50/50 split is fair, and I don't want to risk losing more money to inflation."
