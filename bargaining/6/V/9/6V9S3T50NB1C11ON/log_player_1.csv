Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This offer is designed to be fair in the first round, giving me a larger share while still giving Bob a small amount.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more, Bob's offer is still a fair split considering the inflation affecting him. It's better to accept and end the game than to risk losing more money in subsequent rounds."
