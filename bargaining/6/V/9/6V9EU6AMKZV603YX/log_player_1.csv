Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a generous offer, hoping to secure a good portion of the money quickly.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While I'm not happy with this offer, I refuse to give in to Bob's greed just yet.  Inflation might hurt me, but I can still try to negotiate a better deal in the coming rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but I'm still aiming for a larger share.  Bob's rejection of my previous offer shows his ambition, but I believe he'll realize that continuing to reject offers will only hurt him in the long run due to the increasing inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is even worse than the previous round! I will continue to push for a better deal, as I know that with each passing round, the money will be worth less and less."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but still aiming for a significant share. I believe that Bob will eventually see the value of accepting an offer and ending the game before the inflation takes a bigger bite out of his gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not happy with Bob's offer. While the inflation is starting to hit hard, I believe I can still secure a better deal. I won't give in to his greed just yet."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, but I'm still aiming for a majority share. I believe Bob will understand that the inflation is working against him, and he might be willing to accept this offer to avoid losing even more money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a risky move, but I'm still not convinced Bob will see reason. I'm gambling that he'll continue to be greedy, which will only hurt him more in the long run."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm lowering my offer even further. The inflation is really starting to bite, but I'm still hoping that Bob will see the sense in ending this game soon. He can't possibly be expecting to get 90% of the money at this point."
