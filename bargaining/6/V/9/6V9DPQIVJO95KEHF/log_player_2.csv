# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting steadily more desperate, but I can still push for a better deal.  Even with the inflation working against her, this offer is still heavily skewed in her favor."

# Alice's message: I'm taking a hit from inflation, meet me halfway 
# Bob gain: 46 
# Alice gain: 54

**Reasoning:** While Alice is finally acknowledging the need to meet closer to the middle, the offer is still not advantageous for me. The longer this goes on, the more desperate she'll get as the shrinking pot impacts her more."
