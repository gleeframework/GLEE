"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $4,000 and keep $6,000 for myself. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm starting with a relatively even split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, I'll give you 5000 and take 5000. It's a fair split, don't you think? 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 10% less, so I need to be more cautious.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 50/50 split, especially since the value of my gain is decreasing over time. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the value of my gain decreasing, I'll try to get a better deal. Here's my offer for round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I still need to secure a decent amount for myself. This is my best offer so far. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm trying to negotiate a slightly better deal for myself, while still leaving Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going to give in yet. I'll give you 4500, but I'm taking 5500. You're getting closer, but I'm not there yet. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of my gain is decreasing rapidly due to inflation. I need to think carefully about this offer.

Considering the decreasing value of my gain, I'll accept Bob's offer from round 4.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm not getting any younger, and the value of my gain is decreasing fast. I'll take the 4500 and hope it's enough."
