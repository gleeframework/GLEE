"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I'm offering you 40%. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. Since the money doesn't lose value for me, I'm in no rush to accept an offer that's less than half. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that's slightly more favorable to me, considering Alice's initial offer and the fact that the money loses value for her with each passing round.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is money. I'm willing to be generous, but this is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll think carefully about this offer. Considering that the money doesn't lose value for me and Alice is getting impatient, I'll weigh my options.

{""decision"": ""reject""}
### 
I'm willing to take the risk and see if Alice is bluffing about this being her final offer. Since the money loses value for her with each passing round, I might be able to get a better deal if I wait. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Considering Alice's last offer and her mention of it being her final one, I'll make a counteroffer that's still favorable to me but takes into account her growing impatience and the devaluing money for her.

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your urgency, but I'm not in a rush. Given the circumstances, I think this is a fair offer.""}"
