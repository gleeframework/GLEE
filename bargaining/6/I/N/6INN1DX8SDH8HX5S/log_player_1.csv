"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! Accept this and we can finalize the deal.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount, hoping he'll be eager to accept and we can move on. My message is a friendly one, trying to set a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, a fair start! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is already taking its toll!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully. Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, I'm looking for a better deal. Splitting it 50/50 is a fair offer, but I'd like to get a bit more.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 10% less again, so I'll have to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more. Accept this and we can finalize the deal.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a slightly better deal for me, but still a fair compromise. My message is a gentle reminder that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not getting any younger (or wealthier, thanks to inflation!)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I still think I deserve a bigger share 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings! With the money worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'm getting a bit desperate. Bob's offer of $400,000 is a bit better than my previous offer, but I'm not sure if it's enough to sway me.

Considering the significant difference in our proposed shares, I'll have to think carefully. I'd rather not give Bob the majority of the money, but I'm not sure if I can do better.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 5, the money is worth even less due to inflation. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to make sure I get a fair share. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $450,000, which is a bit more than my previous offer. I'm trying to find a middle ground, hoping that Bob will accept this offer and we can finalize the deal. My message is a friendly reminder that I'm still looking for a fair share, but I'm willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to what I want, but I still think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is really eating away at my potential earnings! With the money worth 40.95% less than in the first round, I'm getting a bit desperate. Bob's offer of $450,000 is the same as my previous offer, but I'm not sure if I can afford to reject it.

Considering the significant difference in our proposed shares, I'm starting to feel like I need to take what I can get. I'll accept this offer, hoping that it's the best I can do.
