{

""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer was quite bold. Let's be more realistic. I propose a 70/30 split in my favor. This round is my best offer, as the value decreases for me with each round.  It's a fair deal considering the circumstances.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's split this evenly. The inflation is hitting us both, and I'm sure we can agree that a 50/50 split is the fairest option at this point.  Let's end this game amicably. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```
At this point, accepting the 50/50 split is the most logical choice for Bob. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is decreasing for Bob each round. Accepting $500,000 now is better than risking a worse offer later when it'll be worth even less.
* **Alice's Position:** Alice is unlikely to offer more than 50% at this stage.  She knows Bob is feeling the pressure of inflation.
* **Fair Outcome:** While Bob would have preferred his 70/30 split, a 50/50 split is objectively fair and avoids the risk of walking away with nothing.
