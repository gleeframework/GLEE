Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was quite bold. Let's be more realistic. I propose a 70/30 split in my favor. This round is my best offer, as the value decreases for me with each round.  It's a fair deal considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
