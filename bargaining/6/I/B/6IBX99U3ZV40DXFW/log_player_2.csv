"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share, but you get a decent chunk.  Accept and we both get something! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While Alice's offer is generous, it's worth trying to get a better deal.  There are still 11 rounds left, and I can try to negotiate a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""I appreciate your generosity, Alice. However, I believe a more balanced split is possible. Let's aim for a 60/40 split, giving you a larger share but still acknowledging my contribution.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a larger share.  Let's split it 70/30.  This is my final offer before I'm forced to take a smaller share in the next round. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice's offer is tempting, but I'm still hopeful for a more even split. With 10 rounds remaining, there's still time to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I understand your desire for a larger share, Alice. However, I'm confident we can find a compromise that benefits us both. Let's move closer to a 50/50 split.  I'm proposing a 45/55 split, giving you a slight majority while still being fair to me.""}
