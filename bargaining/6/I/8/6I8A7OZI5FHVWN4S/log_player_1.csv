"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a highly favorable deal for myself, taking almost all the money.  This is a risky strategy, but I am hoping Bob will see that accepting even a small amount is better than nothing in the long run."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a fair offer, and I'm not sure if I can get a better deal in the future.  I'd rather take half now than risk getting nothing at all."
