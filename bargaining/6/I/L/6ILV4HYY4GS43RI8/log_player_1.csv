"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Fair and square, let's split it 60-40""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering we're both starting with a clean slate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script, 60-40 in my favor this time.  It's just a slight adjustment to be more balanced. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about Bob's revised offer, which still favors him more than me. I was hoping for a more even split, and this offer doesn't seem to address the imbalance. I'll reject this offer and hope to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, I'll give you a slight edge, but I still want a decent share""}

I'm proposing a 52-48 split, which is a slight adjustment from my initial offer. I'm willing to give Bob a slightly larger share, but I still want to ensure I get a decent amount."
