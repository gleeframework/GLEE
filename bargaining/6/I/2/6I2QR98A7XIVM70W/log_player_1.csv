"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

This offer gives me $9,000 and Bob $1,000.  It's a pretty aggressive start, but I'm hoping to secure a good chunk of the money early on before inflation kicks in too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer. While I'm losing value due to inflation, it's only 10% while Bob is losing 20%. This means I have more leverage. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000} 
```

I'm going to offer Bob $3,000 and keep $7,000 for myself.  The inflation is working in my favor, and this seems like a fair offer given the circumstances."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob is losing a lot more value due to inflation than I am, I'm still not going to accept this offer. I'm hoping to secure a better deal in the next round. I'm still in a better position, even though the inflation is starting to bite."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob $4,000 and keep $6,000 for myself.  I think this is a reasonable compromise considering the inflation we're both facing.  Hopefully, Bob will finally accept."
