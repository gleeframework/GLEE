"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

This offer gives me a larger share, but I'm willing to compromise to avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, it's better to accept this offer than risk further inflation."
