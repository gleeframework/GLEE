"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share this time, but it's your turn next! 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's tempting to accept the deal, but I'm going to reject it. Even though I'm only getting 10 dollars, if I reject it, I'll have the chance to propose a deal in the next round, and the money will be worth more to me then. I'll aim for a fairer split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly this time. I think 60/40 is a good start.  You'll get more than I did in the last round, and we can start with a more equitable division.""}
