"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'm willing to give you 40% of the total.""
}
```

This way, I'm giving Bob a decent share, but keeping a slightly larger portion for myself to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think it's a good compromise 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one...

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my expectations. Considering the reduced value of the money, I think 70 is a relatively good offer for me, and it's a decent compromise.

I'll accept the offer.
