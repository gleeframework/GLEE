"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I think this split reflects our positions in the game. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: Since the money is worth 5% less for me in each subsequent round, I want to try to get a better offer from Alice. 30% seems too low, considering we're starting with an equal claim to the $100. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.\n\n###\n\nPlease proceed to the next round. I'll make a proposal for division."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that is more favorable to me, considering the 5% decrease in value for each round.\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, Alice. This split is more reasonable, given the conditions.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease relay this offer to Alice. I'm looking forward to her response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The value is decreasing, Bob. Let's settle this now with a reasonable offer. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll reject this offer. Although the money is worth 9.75% less for me now, Alice's offer of 35% is still not satisfactory. Given that we're already in the third round, I'll try to get a better deal.\n\n###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nPlease proceed to the next round. I'll make another proposal for division.\n\n###\n\nAlso, please keep track of the decreasing value due to inflation for my next offer. The total amount may not add up to 100 due to this.\n\n###\n\nLet's move on to Round 4."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make another offer, taking into account the decreasing value of the money for me. Since the money is worth 9.75% less for me now, I'll adjust my offer accordingly.\n\n###\n\nLet's calculate the adjusted total value for me: 100 - (100 * 0.0975) = 90.25. I'll base my offer on this adjusted value.\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 42, ""alice_gain"": 58, ""message"": ""Considering the decreasing value, I think this split is more reasonable. Let's settle this, Alice.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease relay this offer to Alice. I'm hoping she'll accept this one.\n\n###\n\nAlso, please keep track of the decreasing value due to inflation for the next round, if needed. The total amount may not add up to 100 due to this.\n\n###\n\nLet's move on to Alice's response."
