"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can split the money quickly!""
}
```

I'm offering you $200,000, which is a fair share considering the initial amount of $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 7:3, it's a fair compromise! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking its toll!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to weigh the pros and cons.

I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that a 7:3 split is fair, especially considering the reduced value of the money. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me halfway and we can both walk away with a decent amount!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to take into account the increased inflation. I'm offering you $400,000, which is a more modest share, but still a fair one considering the reduced value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, let's try to make a deal! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value now!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. While it's a slightly better offer than before, I'm not sure if it's enough to make it worth accepting.

I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm still hoping for a better deal, taking into account the significant reduction in the money's value due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll try to squeeze out a bit more, but I'm not getting any younger!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to take into account the increased inflation and the fact that Bob has been pushing me to accept his previous offers. I'm offering you $450,000, which is a slightly more generous share, but still a fair one considering the reduced value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle and split it 50/50, it's a fair compromise! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really eating away at the money's value now!

Considering the drastic reduction in the money's value, I'm starting to think that a 50/50 split might be the best option. It's not ideal, but it's a fair compromise, and I don't want to risk waiting for a better offer that might not come.

I'll accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

Let's just split the remaining $1,000,000 and be done with it!"
