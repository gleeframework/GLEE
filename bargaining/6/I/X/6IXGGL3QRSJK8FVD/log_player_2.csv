Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be reasonable, but you need to meet me halfway. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, accepting is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** Bob is experiencing significant inflation. Every round makes his potential gain less valuable. 
* **Alice's Stance:**  Alice has labeled this her ""final offer,"" suggesting she might not budge further.
* **Future Rounds:** If Bob rejects this, he's gambling on getting a better deal in fewer rounds, with the inflation working against him. The risk of ending up with nothing is increasing rapidly.

While 45% isn't ideal, it's better than risking a worse outcome by continuing to play."
