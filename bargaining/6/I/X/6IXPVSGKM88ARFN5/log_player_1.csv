"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

This way, I'll get 80% of the initial amount, and Bob will get 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll have to reassess the offer.

Since my gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll consider the effective gain as 800,000 * 0.9 = 720,000.

Bob's offer is 500,000, which is worth 20% less than his initial 20% share, so it's 200,000 * 0.8 = 160,000.

Considering the reduced values, I'll decide to reject this offer, as I'd be getting less than my initial share.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll make a new offer. 

Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the current value of the money, and Bob will get 40%."
