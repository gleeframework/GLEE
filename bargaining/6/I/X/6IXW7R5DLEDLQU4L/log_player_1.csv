"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 7:3, a fair and generous offer!""}

I'm proposing that I receive 700,000 and Bob receives 300,000. I think this is a fair and generous offer, considering I'm making the first proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script. 70/30 my way this time.  You'll get a decent share, but it's my turn to propose. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with Bob's proposal, as I think it's too skewed in his favor. I was hoping for a more balanced split, and this offer doesn't meet my expectations. I'll reject it and make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 55/45. It's a fair compromise, don't you think?""}

I'm proposing a more balanced split, with me receiving 550,000 and Bob receiving 450,000. I think this is a reasonable compromise, considering the previous offers."
