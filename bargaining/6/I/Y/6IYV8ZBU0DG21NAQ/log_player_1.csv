"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $100, leaving Bob with 20%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more balanced split is fair.  Let's both get a good chunk of this money. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of 40$ is actually worth 36$ (90% of 40$).

I'm not thrilled with the 40% gain, but it's a better offer than the previous one. I'll consider it. 

I'll accept this offer. 

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
