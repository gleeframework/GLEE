"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the lead, but I'll still give you a fair share! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less after inflation, I'll need to adjust my expectations accordingly.

I'm not thrilled about the 40/60 split, but I'll consider it. I'll decide to reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, I'll aim for a slightly higher share to compensate for the decrease in value.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I still think I deserve a bigger share!""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting greedy, but I'll still give you a chance to accept! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really biting now!

Considering the significant decrease in value, I'm not thrilled about the 30/70 split. I'll try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth even less now, I'll aim for a higher share to compensate for the decrease in value. Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 35,
  ""bob_gain"": 65,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly bigger share, but I still think I deserve a fair deal!""

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking a big risk, but I think I can get a better deal! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is really taking a toll!

Considering the massive decrease in value, I'm not sure if I want to accept a 20/80 split. It's a pretty drastic difference, and I'm not sure if it's worth it. I'll think carefully before making a decision.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm going all in, but I'm willing to give you a small consolation prize! 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is really eating away at the value!

Considering the massive difference in the split, I'm not thrilled about accepting a 10/90 split. It's a pretty one-sided deal, and I'm not sure if it's worth it. I'll think carefully before making a decision.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

Your turn, Bob!"

```
{

  ""bob_gain"": 65,
  ""message"": ""I'm running out of time, but I'm still willing to give you a decent deal!""

Round 10

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm almost there, but I'll give you a tiny bit to make it worth your while! 
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money!

Considering the extremely one-sided split, I'm not thrilled about accepting a 5/95 split. It's a tiny consolation prize, and I'm not sure if it's worth it. I'll think carefully before making a decision.

However, I'm running out of time, and the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. I'll decide to accept this offer, hoping that it's better than going home with nothing.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I guess I'll take the 5 bucks!"
