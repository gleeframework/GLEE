Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The clock is ticking Alice, and inflation is eating away at your potential gains.  This offer is still generous considering. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage. While the offer might seem tempting as time goes on, accepting such a low amount sets a bad precedent and Bob is likely to continue lowballing. It's worth the risk to counter-propose, aiming for a more equitable split."
