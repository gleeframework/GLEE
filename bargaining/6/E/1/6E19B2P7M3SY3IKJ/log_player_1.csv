"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing that we split the $1,000,000 60-40 in my favor, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly better deal. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob, the effective values are:

My gain: $600,000 x 0.9 = $540,000
Bob's gain: $400,000 x 0.95 = $380,000

Bob's new offer is:

Alice gain: $550,000
Bob gain: $450,000

This is a better deal for me than the previous offer, and I'm willing to accept it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
