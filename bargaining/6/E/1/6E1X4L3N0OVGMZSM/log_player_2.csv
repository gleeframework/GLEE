"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair deal.  I'm willing to give you a thousand dollars, but I'll need the rest to make sure we both get a good return on this.

# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I understand you want a good return, but that offer isn't fair to me.  Let's split it closer to even. This is my counter-offer.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a larger share to make this worthwhile for me.  Let's split it 60/40. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, the effects of inflation are starting to become significant. Accepting 4000 in round 3 is a significantly worse deal than accepting even her original offer in round 1. It's worth risking another round to see if we can get a better split."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Alice, we need to find a compromise soon. Inflation is eating into our potential gains. This is my final offer.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think it's time to meet in the middle.  Let's split the money evenly, before inflation wipes out any potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is finally agreeing to a 50/50 split. While we could push for more in the next round, the inflation rate is working heavily against us. Accepting 5000 now is better than risking a worse deal later, or even ending up with nothing if we can't agree."
