"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. The message is a bit of a taunt, but I'm hoping Bob will see the value in accepting a decent sum rather than risking it all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair start, let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

I'll accept this offer.
