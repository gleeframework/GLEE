"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a fair offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

This way, we both get $50, and we can split the money fairly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider the new offer. Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'd rather get more money now to compensate for the loss in value. I'll reject the offer.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a higher share to account for the decreasing value of money. Here's my new proposal:

```
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

This way, I'll get a larger share to compensate for the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on my potential earnings! Given the reduced value of money, I'll consider Bob's offer. Since my gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'll think carefully... I'll accept this offer.
