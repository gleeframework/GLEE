I'm starting with a 90/10 split in my favor. I want to see if Bob is willing to accept a small share early on.  Let's see what happens!"

I'm lowering my share slightly, but I'm still keeping the majority.  I believe this is a fair compromise, and Bob should accept it to avoid losing more money to inflation."
