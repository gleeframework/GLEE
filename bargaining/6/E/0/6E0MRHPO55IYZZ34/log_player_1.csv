"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 40, you can do better next round""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial 100$, which is $40. This is a fair starting point, and I'm leaving room for Bob to negotiate or improve his offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 50, now it's your turn to think! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll consider the actual value of the money I'd gain. My gain of $50 is worth 90% of its original value, which is $45.

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I think it's a good opportunity to get something. I'll accept Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
