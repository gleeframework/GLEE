"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take the first round!""}

I'm proposing a 60:40 split, giving me 60 dollars and leaving Bob with 40 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, let's try for a better split! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll need to adjust my thinking. Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about giving up so much, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept Bob's offer for now.
