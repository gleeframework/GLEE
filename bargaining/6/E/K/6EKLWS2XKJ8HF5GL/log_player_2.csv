"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  It benefits us both to settle this quickly. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. The current offer doesn't quite meet my expectations, and I believe we can find a more mutually beneficial division. Let's see what the next round brings!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is more reasonable, considering the inflation factor. Let's settle this before the money loses more value!""}\n\nI'm making a counteroffer that takes into account the inflation factor, which affects both of us but more significantly impacts Alice. I believe this division is more balanced and encourages Alice to accept before the money's value decreases further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out. I'm willing to compromise slightly. 58/42 - take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll reject this offer as well. Considering the inflation, Alice's offer doesn't compensate for the loss of value over time. I believe I can still negotiate a better deal, so I'll proceed to the next round.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 57, ""alice_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Given the increasing inflation impact, I'm willing to slightly increase my share while still offering you a substantial amount. Let's conclude this before the value drops further.""}\n\nConsidering the accelerated decrease in value for both of us, especially for Alice, I'm adjusting my offer to reflect the urgency and the impact of inflation. This division still provides Alice with a considerable amount but acknowledges the growing loss of value over time."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm meeting you in the middle. 55/45. We're both losing out with every refusal. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nGiven the significant impact of inflation on both our potential gains, especially on Alice's, I believe accepting this offer is the most reasonable decision. The current division of 55/45, considering the decreased value, is more acceptable than risking further loss in subsequent rounds. It's time to finalize the agreement before the money loses any more value."
