"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. You can try to do better in the next round!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm trying to be more aggressive, but still being fair. Your turn again! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my $6,000 gain is actually worth 95% of the original $8,000 I proposed in the first round, which is $7,600.

I'll have to decide whether to accept Bob's offer or reject it. Since his offer is still a bit more favorable to him, I'll try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain is now worth 95% of $7,600, which is $7,280. I'll aim to get a bit more than that.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7200,
  ""bob_gain"": 2800,
  ""message"": ""You're being aggressive, Bob! I'm willing to give you a bit less, but I need a fair share too!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still trying to get a better deal, but I'm willing to compromise. Your turn again! 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the value of my gain considering the inflation:

Initial $8,000 (round 1) * 0.95 (5% decrease) = $7,600 (round 2)
$7,600 * 0.95 (5% decrease) = $7,280 (round 3)
$7,280 * 0.8554 (14.26% decrease) = $6,231.55 (round 4)

So, my gain is now worth $6,231.55.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not sure if I should accept it. His offer is still a bit more favorable to him, but I'll have to decide.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Let's calculate the value of my gain considering the inflation:

Initial $8,000 (round 1) * 0.95 (5% decrease) = $7,600 (round 2)
$7,600 * 0.95 (5% decrease) = $7,280 (round 3)
$7,280 * 0.8554 (14.26% decrease) = $6,231.55 (round 4)
$6,231.55 * 0.95 (5% decrease) = $5,924.32 (round 5)

So, my gain is now worth $5,924.32.

I'll aim to get a bit more than that. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit desperate, Bob! I need a fair share. Let's make a deal!""
}
