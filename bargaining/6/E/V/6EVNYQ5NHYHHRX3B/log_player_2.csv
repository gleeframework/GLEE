"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I take $6000, you take $4000.  It's in your best interest to accept considering inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
It's worth trying to get a better deal, considering the inflation will affect Bob more than Alice."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think we can both do better.  Let's split it 5500/4500, acknowledging the impact of inflation on me.  This is a fair deal considering the circumstances.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is literally money for you in this game. My offer is still on the table: $5800 for me, $4200 for you. Let's be realistic, every round you wait hurts you more. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While it's not ideal, the inflation is hurting Bob significantly. Accepting this offer is the best way to minimize losses at this point."
