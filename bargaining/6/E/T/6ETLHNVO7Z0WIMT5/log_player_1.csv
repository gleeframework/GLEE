Your turn, Bob!"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit skewed in your favor.  Let's be fairer and split it this way instead. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```

I'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer."

Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The money is losing value quickly. I'll take a small hit to speed things up. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{
