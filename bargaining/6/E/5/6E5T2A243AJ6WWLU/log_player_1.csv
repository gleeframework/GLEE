"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair starting point!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $100, which is $40, and keeping 60% for myself, which is $60."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair, but I'll be happy to consider other options. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I still value $40 as $40. However, Bob's gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, so $60 is now worth $57.20.

Considering the offer, I think I can do better than 40% of the remaining value. I'll reject this offer.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is still worth the same for me, and it's worth 5% less for Bob, I'll aim for a higher percentage for myself. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Will you accept a 55/45 split?""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time. Inflation is getting to me, and I'd rather see this game end. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the values:

My gain of $55 from the previous round is still worth $55 to me.

Bob's gain of $45 from the previous round is worth 85.74% of $45, which is $38.53.

Now, considering Bob's new offer, I'll calculate the value of my gain ($50) and Bob's gain ($50) in the current round:

My gain is worth $55.
Bob's gain is worth 85.74% of $50, which is $42.87.

Since I can get a higher value for myself with this offer, I'll accept it.
