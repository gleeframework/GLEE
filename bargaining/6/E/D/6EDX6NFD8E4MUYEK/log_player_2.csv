Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.

# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm being generous! 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is still heavily favoring herself in this deal, even with the inflation.  I need to push for a better split.
