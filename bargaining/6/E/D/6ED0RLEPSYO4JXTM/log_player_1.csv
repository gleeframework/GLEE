"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 4000, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering the inflation, my 4000 dollars in this round is worth 80% of the 5000 dollars I would have gotten in the first round. That's a significant decrease. I'm not sure if I'm willing to accept this offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a higher amount to account for the decrease in value. Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly higher amount, but I'm not going to give away all the value""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 4800, but I think I deserve a slightly higher share 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on the value of the money! My 4800 dollars in this round is worth only 48.8% of the 5000 dollars I would have gotten in the first round. That's a significant drop.

Considering the decrease in value, I think I should accept this offer. It's not ideal, but it's better than going into the next round with even less value.
