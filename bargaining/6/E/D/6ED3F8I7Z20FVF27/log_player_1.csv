"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 40, and I'll take 60. It's a good starting point.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting 60 dollars and Bob getting 40 dollars. I'm framing it as a fair starting point, but I'm really trying to get the better deal to maximize my gains over the next 12 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good offer. You can't expect to get 60% of the money! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less for me, I'm actually getting 70 dollars, which is equivalent to 70 / 0.9 = 77.78 dollars in the first round.

Considering the inflation effect, Bob's offer of 30 dollars is equivalent to 30 / 0.8 = 37.5 dollars in the first round. That's a significant reduction in value.

Given the reduced value of the money, I'm not as eager to accept a 70-30 split. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 10% less for me, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to compensate for the reduced value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I need to make up for the inflation. 80 for me, 20 for you. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

I'm proposing an 80-20 split, which is a more aggressive offer than before. I'm hoping Bob will accept this deal to avoid further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly bigger share this time, but I'm not going to give in too easily. You can still get a good deal if you're willing to negotiate. 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the equivalent value of the money in the first round:

My gain: 75 / 0.271 = 276.75 dollars in the first round
Bob's gain: 25 / 0.482 = 51.95 dollars in the first round

Considering the significant reduction in value, I'm not thrilled about this offer. I was hoping for a better deal, especially since the money is worth less for me.

However, I don't want to give up too much ground, and 75 dollars is still a decent amount. I'll accept this offer, but I'll be keeping a close eye on the next round.
