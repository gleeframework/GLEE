I'm proposing to take $9,000 and leave Bob with $1,000.  This is a pretty aggressive offer, but I'm hoping Bob will see it as a chance to get something rather than nothing if he rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
While I'd prefer more, getting $4,000 is better than nothing.  It's a significant amount, and Bob is clearly willing to negotiate."
