"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I'll have to accept a smaller share of the money to make it worth the same in real terms. I'll accept Bob's offer.
