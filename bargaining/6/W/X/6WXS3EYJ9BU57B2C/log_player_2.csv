Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think I deserve a bit more since I'm taking the risk of inflation.""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn, Alice!"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer, Bob. A 50/50 split is the fairest option. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nA 50/50 split is a fair offer, considering the inflation. I don't want to risk losing more value in the next round."
