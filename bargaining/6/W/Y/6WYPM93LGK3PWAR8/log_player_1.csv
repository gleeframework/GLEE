"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 40% share of the $100, which is a relatively fair split. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the lead, let's see if you like this split! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","That's a pretty aggressive split in Bob's favor. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not comfortable with a 70-30 split, so I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, Bob! 50-50 seems fair to me.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a more equal division of the $100. Now it's Bob's turn to respond again!"

# Bob's message: You rejected my offer, now it's your turn to get a smaller share! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob's trying to take advantage of me! Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not comfortable with an 80-20 split, and I think Bob's message is a bit salty. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 60% share, which is a bit more generous than my previous offer, but still not as generous as his previous offers. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'll take the majority of the cash!

# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob's really trying to squeeze me now! Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not going to let Bob walk all over me. A 90-10 split is completely unacceptable, and I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round. I'm not getting desperate, I'm just getting strategic!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

}
```

I'm offering Bob a 65% share, which is a bit more generous than my previous offers. I'm trying to find a compromise that works for both of us. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're running out of time, take it or leave it!

# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob's really putting the pressure on now! Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not going to get taken advantage of at this point. A 95-5 split is completely unacceptable, and I'm not going to accept such a lopsided deal. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round, even if it's my last chance."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're really running out of options now, this is my final offer! 
# Alice gain: 2 
# Bob gain: 98 
Do you accept this offer?","This is getting ridiculous! Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not going to accept a 98-2 split, that's completely unacceptable. I'm not going to let Bob take advantage of me at this point. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round, but I'm running out of options!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11

  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bigger share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of completely!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 75% share, which is a bit more generous than my previous offers. I'm trying to find a compromise that works for both of us, but I'm not sure if it's too little, too late. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my last chance, take it or we both get nothing! 
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","This is the final round and Bob is trying to take advantage of me one last time. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not going to accept a 99-1 split. I'd rather walk away with nothing than let Bob take 99% of the $100. It's not a fair deal, and I'm not going to give in at this point."
