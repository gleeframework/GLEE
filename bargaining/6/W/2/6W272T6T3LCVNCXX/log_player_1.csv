"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 20% of the total.""
}
```

This offer suggests that I, Alice, will take 80% of the original $100, and Bob will take 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 20, but I think I deserve more. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, I now need to consider the offer in terms of the reduced value.

Bob's offer is 20, but that's 20 of the original 100. Since the money is worth 10% less, I'll consider it as 18 in terms of value.

I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal, but I'll accept the offer since it's still a better option than going to the next round.
