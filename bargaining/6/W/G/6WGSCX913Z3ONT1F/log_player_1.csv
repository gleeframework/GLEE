"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, Bob. No need to negotiate further.""
}
```

This is a straightforward offer, splitting the money evenly between us. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can't be serious with a 50/50 split. I'm offering you a fair 7/3 ratio. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not impressed with Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not going to accept a 7/3 ratio. I think I can do better than that!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""You said 7/3 was fair? I'll give you a better deal than that. 60/40 in my favor, but still a decent split.""
}
```

This offer is a bit more in my favor, but still leaves Bob with a significant amount of money. Let's see if he'll accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You think 60/40 is a decent split? I'll give you a chance to reconsider with a 55/45 split. It's still a good deal for you. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is trying to sweeten the deal, but I'm not convinced yet.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think I can do better than a 55/45 split. I'm not going to settle for that."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting desperate, Bob. I'm taking a bigger share, but it's still a decent offer. Don't push your luck.""
}
```

This offer is a bit more aggressive, but I'm still leaving Bob with a significant amount of money. Let's see if he'll take it or try to negotiate further!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're really pushing your luck now. I'm not going to let you get away with a 7/3 split. I'll give you a 60/40 split, but I'm not budging any further. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to turn the tables on me!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I've already rejected a 60/40 split in round 3, and I'm not going to accept it again. I think I can do better than that. Bob's trying to get me to accept a deal I've already turned down before. Not this time!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""You're not budging, Bob? Fine. I'll take a bigger share. Don't say I didn't warn you.""
}
```

This offer is a bit more aggressive, with me taking a larger share of the money. I'm hoping Bob will realize he's not going to get a better deal and accept this one."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're really trying to take me for a ride now. I'm not going to let you walk away with 80% of the money. I'm sticking to my guns on a 7/3 split, no exceptions. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is sticking to his original offer, but with a slightly smaller share for himself.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I've already rejected a 7/3 split in round 2, and I'm not going to accept it again. I think I can do better than that. Bob's not budging, but I'm not going to budge either. It's time to get more aggressive!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""You're not serious about the 7/3 split, Bob. I'm taking 90% of the money. It's time to accept or walk away.""
}
```

This offer is a very aggressive one, with me taking a massive 90% of the money. I'm hoping Bob will realize he's not going to get a better deal and accept this one."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're really testing my patience now. I'm not going to let you take 90% of the money. I'm making a final offer: 80/20. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to make a final stand, but I'm not impressed.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I've already rejected a 7/3 split, a 60/40 split, and a 55/45 split, and I'm not going to accept an 80/20 split. I think I can do better than that. Bob's final offer is actually a pretty good deal for me, but I'm not going to accept it. I'll keep pushing for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 999000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""You've had plenty of chances, Bob. This is my final offer. Take the last dollar or walk away with nothing.""
}
```

This offer is extremely one-sided, with me taking almost the entire $1,000,000 and leaving Bob with just $1. I'm hoping Bob will realize he's not going to get a better deal and accept this one."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Fine, you want to play it this way? I'll take the 50/50 split you offered in round 1. I'd rather have half the money than nothing. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The final round!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think I was too aggressive in my previous offers, and Bob's final offer is actually a pretty good deal for both of us. I'd rather accept a 50/50 split than risk getting nothing. It's time to call it a day and split the money evenly!"
