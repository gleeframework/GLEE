I'm taking a very aggressive approach in the first round, aiming for almost all the money. It's risky, but the inflation will hurt Bob more if we go on for longer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is extremely unfair, even with the inflated value. It's clear he's using his position to try and take the majority.  I'll reject and try to negotiate a fairer split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000} 
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split. It's fair and acknowledges the inflation we've both experienced. Hopefully, this will be more appealing to Bob than his last offer."
