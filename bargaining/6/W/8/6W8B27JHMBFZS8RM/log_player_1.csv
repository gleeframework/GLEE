Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,

}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself. I'm hoping he'll accept this generous offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, Alice. We both get more this way. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks he's being generous, but I'm not convinced. I'd rather wait for a better offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less now, I'll aim for a higher share to compensate for the loss in value. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting the better deal, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself. Let's see if he'll accept this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, Alice. Let's avoid further rounds and get something before inflation eats away at our share. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value fast! I'd better take what I can get. Bob's offer is still not ideal, but it's better than risking further erosion of the money's value.
