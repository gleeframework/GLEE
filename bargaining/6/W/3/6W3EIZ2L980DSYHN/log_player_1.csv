"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer to divide the $1,000,000 and the message I'd like to pass to Bob:

I'm proposing to take 60% of the money, leaving 40% for Bob. I've included a message to Bob, suggesting that this split is fair, especially considering the inflation that will affect the value of the money in subsequent rounds.

Please relay this offer to Bob!"
