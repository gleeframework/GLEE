Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I think 58-42 is a more suitable offer. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the urgency, but considering the inflation impact, I think 57-43 is a more reasonable offer. 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, the effects of inflation are significant for Bob. While the offer isn't ideal, accepting ensures Bob receives something rather than risking further losses due to inflation in future rounds.
