"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable""}\n\nI'm offering Bob 40% of the money, which I believe is a fair and reasonable starting point for our negotiations. Since I'm starting the offer, I've given myself a slight advantage, but Bob still gets a significant share. The message ""Let's be reasonable"" aims to set a tone for the negotiation, suggesting that we should aim for a mutually agreeable solution rather than trying to maximize our individual gains at the expense of the other."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair, considering the money will be worth less for me in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, although he's right that the money will be worth less for him in the next round, a 60/40 split in his favor is still not acceptable to me, especially since the money's value remains the same for me. By rejecting this offer, I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal in the next round, taking into account the fact that Bob will be more motivated to reach an agreement as the value of the money continues to decrease for him."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money for Bob.

### {""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, let's meet in the middle""}

In this offer, I've reduced my share and increased Bob's share compared to my initial offer, while also considering the fact that the money's value remains the same for me. By framing it as ""meeting in the middle,"" I'm attempting to convey a sense of compromise and fairness, hoping that Bob will be more willing to accept this offer given the decreasing value of the money for him."
