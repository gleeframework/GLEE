"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 7:3 split, which seems reasonable for a starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time, Alice.  It's a fair and simple solution. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 90% of what it was in the first round.

Considering the proposal, I'll have to make a decision. I'm not sure if splitting it evenly is the best option for me, given the inflation. However, it's a fair offer, and I don't want to risk losing more by rejecting it.

I'll accept this offer.
