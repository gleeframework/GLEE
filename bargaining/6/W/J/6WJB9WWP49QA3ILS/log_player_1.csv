Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000, ""message"": ""I'm feeling generous, but I'm also very aware of the inflation! Let's split the money 90/10 in my favor.  It's a good deal for both of us.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was a bit too lopsided for my liking. Let's be fair: I take 6000, you take 4000.  Inflation is a factor, so we should settle this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
