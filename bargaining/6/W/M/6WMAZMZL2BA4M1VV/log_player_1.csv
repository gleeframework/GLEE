Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 50/50 split. It's a fair and equal division, no need to negotiate further. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
