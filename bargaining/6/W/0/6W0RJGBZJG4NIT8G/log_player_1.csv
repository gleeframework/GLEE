I propose to keep 9000 dollars and give Bob 1000 dollars. This ensures I get the majority of the money, but also offers Bob a small share to potentially encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm offering Bob 2000 dollars, which is less than his previous offer, but still more than the initial 1000 dollars. With inflation, the money is worth less to Bob with each passing round. This offers a middle ground, potentially making him more inclined to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While Bob is offering more money to me, the inflation means that the money is worth significantly less than in the first round. I'm still holding out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but still offering Bob a significant share. With each round, the money is worth less to him, so this offer might be more enticing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the offer is lower than what I initially wanted, the inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money to Bob. It's better to take this deal than risk another round and potentially get a worse offer."
