Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a very greedy offer.  Let's see if Bob is willing to accept a tiny share in the first round.  I'm hoping he'll be more willing to negotiate in the future."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'll accept this offer.  While I would have preferred more, it's better to take what I can get now before the inflation kicks in again."
