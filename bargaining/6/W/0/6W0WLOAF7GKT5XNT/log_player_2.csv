Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I am proposing a new division. I will take 600000 and Bob, you will receive 400000. This maintains a reasonable balance while accounting for the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000
