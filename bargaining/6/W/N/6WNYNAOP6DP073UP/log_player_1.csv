I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a relatively fair starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly!"

# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob, the offer is:

```

  ""message"": ""You're getting a better deal this round, but I'm not giving up yet!""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round."
