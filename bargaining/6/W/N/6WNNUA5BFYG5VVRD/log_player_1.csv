"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. This is a generous offer, considering the inflation disadvantage Bob will face in future rounds. I'm hoping for a quick resolution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is significantly worse than my initial proposal. I'm not willing to accept such a dramatic decrease in my share, especially with the inflation disadvantage I'm facing. I'll counter with a more equitable offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm offering a 70/30 split in my favor. This is still a fair offer given the inflation disadvantage Bob is facing. Hopefully, we can reach an agreement this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly worse than my initial proposal.  While the inflation is hurting him more, the 550,000 he is proposing to keep is still too much. I need to get a better deal than this."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to a 60/40 split in my favor. This is still a very reasonable offer, considering Bob's significant inflation disadvantage. I'm hoping we can find a middle ground before the inflation further diminishes our potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, Bob's offer of a 50/50 split is becoming increasingly attractive with the ongoing inflation. Considering the significant devaluation of the money for Bob, this is a reasonable compromise, and accepting this offer guarantees us both a decent share of the money."
