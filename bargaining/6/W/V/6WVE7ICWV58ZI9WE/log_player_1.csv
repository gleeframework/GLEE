"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'd like to propose a more balanced split.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's new offer.

I don't like the fact that Bob is proposing a 60-40 split again, which is the same as my original offer. I'm not sure if he's being sincere about finding a mutually beneficial agreement.

I'll reject this offer and try to make a new proposal that's more favorable to me.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more for myself.""
}
```

I've adjusted the split to 55-45 in my favor, hoping that Bob will accept this offer."
