"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it 60-40, I'm the one making the first offer after all""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want to be fair, but I'm making this offer considering the future rounds. Let's make a deal! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with Bob's offer, considering I was offering him 400,000 in the first round and now he's offering me less than what I initially proposed for myself. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 3:


{
  ""alice_gain"": 580000,
  ""bob_gain"": 420000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, my new offer is slightly more in my favor, but still reasonable. Let's settle this!""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time and the money is losing value fast. This is my final offer, let's close the deal and avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

Considering the significant loss of value due to inflation, I think it's wise to accept Bob's offer and cut my losses. Further rounds will only decrease the value even more, so it's time to settle."
