"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80/20, I'll get a good chunk and you'll still get a fair share.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $80 and Bob gets $20. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering the value of the money will decrease with each round. Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks a 55/45 split is more fair, considering the decreasing value of money. I'm not sure if I want to give him that much, but I also don't want to prolong the game.

I'll accept his offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
