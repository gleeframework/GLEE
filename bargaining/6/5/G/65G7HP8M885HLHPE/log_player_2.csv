Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: Bob, I'm feeling the inflation pinch. Your 60/40 was too harsh. How about 52/48?  It's getting risky for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 520000 
# Alice gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
