"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount of money, and I'm showing Bob that I'm willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the inflation factor.  Let's see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this new offer. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'd like to get a bit more to compensate. However, I don't want to push too hard, as I want to keep the game going.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and wait for the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In this round, the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, and I need to take that into account. I'll aim for a slightly better share this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to give you a bit more. Accept and let's move on.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The inflation is impacting us both. I think a 70/30 split is a fair compromise considering the circumstances.  Let's end this game. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money. A 70/30 split is quite lopsided, and I'm not sure if it's fair considering the initial offer was 60/40. I'll have to think carefully about this one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and see if I can do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now, and I need to be more strategic. I'll aim for a slightly better share, but not too greedy, since I'm not sure how much Bob will offer next.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and see if we can end this game. I'm willing to compromise.""
}
