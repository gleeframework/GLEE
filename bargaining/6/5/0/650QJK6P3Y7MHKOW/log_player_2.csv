"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This gives you a good chunk while ensuring I get the lion's share. Time is ticking and inflation hurts us both! 
# Bob gain: 50000 
# Alice gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. I understand you want a larger share, but my offer reflects the impact of inflation on my end. 70/30 is fair considering the circumstances.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you trying to find middle ground, but your offer was too low. This is my compromise â€“ it accounts for inflation while still reflecting the value I bring to the table. 
# Bob gain: 150000 
# Alice gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to pressure me with time and downplaying the impact of inflation on my potential earnings. While her offer is better than her first, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. I need to show her I'm serious about getting a fairer share, and that I'm willing to risk it for a better outcome in later rounds."

Round 4

{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is a serious offer. 60/40 acknowledges your position while reflecting the significant impact inflation has on my side of the deal. The longer this goes on, the less favorable it becomes for both of us."" 
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, inflation is eating away at your potential gains. This is my final offer, and it's still generous considering the circumstances. Let's close this deal and both walk away with something substantial. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to use scare tactics, highlighting the inflation effect to force my hand. However, her ""final offer"" is still unacceptable. Accepting a quarter of the pie when it's worth significantly less due to inflation is a terrible deal. I'm willing to gamble that she'll become more reasonable as we approach the final rounds."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, it's clear we both want this to be over. Let's be practical. 55/45 is my compromise - it bridges the gap between our previous offers and avoids the increasing losses due to inflation."" 
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sticking to my guns on this. We're running out of time, and your share is dwindling with every passing round. This is a fair offer, take it while you still can. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting desperate, but so am I.  While a 26.49% reduction in value is significant, accepting $350,000 is better than nothing. However, I'm betting Alice is bluffing about sticking to her guns.  We are getting close to the end and she will lose everything if I reject this offer. I will show her I am serious about getting a more even split, even this late in the game."
