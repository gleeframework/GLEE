Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a fairly generous offer.  I'm hoping Bob will accept it, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would have preferred my initial offer, the inflation factor makes this a much more favorable deal for me. It's better to accept now and secure 5000 (though it's worth less than it was originally) than to risk further rounds and potentially lose more."
