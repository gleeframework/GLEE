"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor. I figure it's a good starting point, and since I don't know how inflation will affect Bob, it's best to get a good chunk early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject this offer. While it's better than the previous one, it's still far too low, especially considering the inflation affecting Bob. I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I'm offering a slightly more even split now at 85/15.  Bob's offer was a step in the right direction, but I'm still hoping for a more equitable share.  Since we have a lot of rounds left, there's still room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still not happy with this offer.  While Bob's share has increased, it's still not a fair split considering the inflation affecting him. I'll continue negotiating in hopes of a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm going to offer a slight compromise this round at 80/20.  While I'm still aiming for a larger share, I want to show good faith and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable split before inflation continues to escalate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still not enough for me.  I'm hoping that he'll realize that we're running out of time, and we need to come to an agreement soon to avoid both of us getting nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}
```

I'm sticking with a similar offer as the last round, but I'm decreasing my share slightly to 75.  It's important to acknowledge the impact of inflation on Bob, but I still want to ensure a good portion for myself. We're running out of time, so I'm hoping this will be a more agreeable split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 65 
# Bob gain: 35 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to a more even split, it's still not enough for me. We're running out of time, but I'm not going to settle for a deal that feels unfair. I'll continue to try and negotiate a better outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to 70/30, but I'm hoping that the shrinking window of opportunity will encourage Bob to accept.  We're getting very close to the deadline, and I'm worried about both of us getting nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 86.58% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though I'm getting a much smaller share than I initially hoped for, I have to accept.  We're running out of time, and at this point, anything is better than nothing.  Hopefully, Bob's inflation has hit him hard enough that this is a fair deal for both of us."
