"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $400,000 and taking $600,000 for myself.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more balanced split is fair. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, although he claims it's a more balanced split, I believe I can get a better deal considering I started with a higher offer in the first round. With 10 rounds left, I'm willing to take the risk of inflation to try and negotiate a more favorable outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer to Bob. Since the money is now worth 10% less, I'll adjust the amounts accordingly.
