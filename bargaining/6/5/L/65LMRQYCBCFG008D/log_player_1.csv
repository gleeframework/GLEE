Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit imbalanced, Alice. Let's be a bit more realistic. This offer still gives you a good share. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is already generous considering the inflation. I won't go lower, let's close the deal and avoid losing more. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer seems tempting, it's essential to stand my ground. Accepting 55% now might seem like a lot, but due to inflation, it's worth significantly less than it was in Round 1. Bob is clearly trying to exploit the inflation to his advantage. I need to show him I'm serious about getting a fairer deal."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be practical.  The clock is ticking, and the value is dropping.  This offer is fair and prevents us both from losing out.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:**  While I want a larger share, I need to acknowledge the time pressure and diminishing value. Offering 60/40 shows a willingness to negotiate while still securing a reasonable portion.
* **Urgency:**  Emphasizing the time constraint and inflation reinforces the need for Bob to accept a deal sooner rather than later.
* **Avoiding a Stalemate:**  A firm but fair offer might be the nudge Bob needs to avoid a scenario where we both lose everything."
