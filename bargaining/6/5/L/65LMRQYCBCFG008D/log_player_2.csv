"Round 1

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 40, ""alice_gain"": 60, ""message"": ""Your offer was a bit imbalanced, Alice. Let's be a bit more realistic. This offer still gives you a good share.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you want a larger share, Bob, but time is running out and the money is losing value. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""Alice, this is already generous considering the inflation. I won't go lower, let's close the deal and avoid losing more.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be practical.  The clock is ticking, and the value is dropping.  This offer is fair and prevents us both from losing out. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, Alice is right about the shrinking value. Accepting 40 now is better than risking getting nothing later as inflation eats away at the potential gains."
