"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where each of us gets $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2.

I'm hoping to get a better deal, considering the money is worth less now due to inflation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 420000, ""bob_gain"": 580000}

I'm proposing a slightly more favorable split for myself, but still a relatively close split considering the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

I'm not thrilled with the offer, but I'm also not eager to risk going to the next round with the money being worth even less. Considering the significant drop in value, I'll accept Bob's offer.
