Bob's offer:

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a more even split again. I'm willing to go up to 6000, but I need to see some flexibility from you as well.  Let's end this before we lose more value.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting impatient too, Alice.  Let's move to a more equitable split. I'm offering 6500 for myself, which leaves 3500 for you. This is the last offer I'm making before the inflation really starts to hurt us both. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is getting greedier and clearly banking on me caving due to inflation. While 3500 is a significant amount of money, it's becoming clear that accepting an offer far below a 50/50 split is not in my best interest. I need to show Bob I'm serious about getting a fair deal, even if it means risking a few more rounds."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Let's be realistic and end this now. A 50/50 split is the fairest option. Take it or leave it, but we're wasting valuable time.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  It's time to lay down the law.  By now, Bob clearly understands I won't accept a heavily skewed deal.  Offering a 50/50 split is fair, and the ""take it or leave it"" stance emphasizes that I'm serious about not settling for less. The pressure is on Bob to make a decision before inflation eats away at the value of the deal for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time. I'm sticking with my last offer - 7000 for me, 3000 for you. It's the best we can do before the inflation makes this pointless. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  This is a tough one, as the inflation is starting to bite. However, Bob is clearly trying to exploit the situation. Accepting 3000 would mean he's successfully pressured me into a terrible deal. I need to hold my ground for one more round and hope he starts negotiating reasonably. The risk of getting nothing is preferable to accepting such a low offer."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""bob_gain"": 5200,
""message"": ""Bob, listen carefully. We're down to the wire.  I'm offering you $5,200, more than I'm taking! This is incredibly generous considering the circumstances.  Accept this now, or we both lose out.""
}
```

**Reasoning:** It's time to flip the script and put the pressure on Bob. By offering him slightly more than half, I'm highlighting the urgency of the situation while still aiming for a deal that benefits me. By framing my offer as incredibly generous, I'm hoping to appeal to his rational side and avoid the risk of walking away with nothing. This is a calculated risk, but with only a few rounds remaining, a bold move is needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm serious. We're down to the wire, and we're both losing money. My final offer is 7500 for me, 2500 for you.  It's time to stop being stubborn and take what we can. 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**  This is pure manipulation from Bob. He's trying to capitalize on the time pressure and my previous generosity. Accepting 2500 at this stage would be a huge loss, especially when a 50/50 split was on the table earlier.  I need to call his bluff and show I'm willing to walk away if he doesn't negotiate fairly."

Round 11
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""Bob, this is it. Last chance.  I'm taking a hit with $4,500, you get $5,500.  Agree now, or we both walk away with nothing. Don't be greedy, Bob.""
}
```

**Reasoning:** This is a high-stakes gamble, but time is running out.  Bob has consistently rejected offers close to a 50/50 split, indicating a strong desire for a larger share.  By offering him $5,500, I'm aiming for the highest amount he might accept under pressure.  The message is direct, emphasizing the finality of the situation and appealing to his rational side.  If he rejects this, there's little hope for a fair agreement."
