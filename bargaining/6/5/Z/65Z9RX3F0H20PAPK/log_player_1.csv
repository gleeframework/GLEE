"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40. Fair and simple.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $10,000, leaving Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's split it evenly 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, I'll have to adjust my thinking.

Since the money is worth 5% less for me, I'll have to consider that in my decision. The offer is to split it evenly, which means I'd get $5,000, but considering the inflation, it's equivalent to 5,000 / 0.95 = $5,263.16 in the original value.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
