"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The value decreases significantly with each round. My turn, I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. This is the same deal you offered me, but now adjusted for the current round's inflation.  Let's close the deal now and avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
