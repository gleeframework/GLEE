6000.0,4000.0,Let's be fair and avoid excessive rounds. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor to account for the decreasing value over time. A deal now benefits us both.,Alice,1,

4500.0,5500.0,"I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal than you proposed, but I need a larger share to compensate for the inflation impacting me more. Let's split it 55/45 in my favor, which is a fairer outcome given the circumstances.",Bob,2,

5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, let's be realistic. The value decreases significantly with each round. My turn, I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. This is the same deal you offered me, but now adjusted for the current round's inflation.  Let's close the deal now and avoid further losses.",Alice,3,
