"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal than you proposed, but I need a larger share to compensate for the inflation impacting me more. Let's split it 55/45 in my favor, which is a fairer outcome given the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
