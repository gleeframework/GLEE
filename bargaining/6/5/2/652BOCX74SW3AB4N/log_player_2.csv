"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I take the lion's share, but you get a decent chunk. Accept this, and we both walk away with something. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While it's tempting to take the $100,000, it's better to see if Alice will offer a more even split in the next round.  The inflation factor means each round is increasingly important."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
