# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is using the inflation difference to his advantage, trying to inch closer to a more favorable split. While the gap is closing, it's still important to hold out for a better offer as long as the potential gains outweigh the losses from inflation."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the increasing inflation disparity, I believe a 60/40 split in my favor is now a more accurate reflection of the value we'll actually receive 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a turning point. While Bob tries to frame the offer as fair due to inflation, he's now aiming for the split I initially proposed, which heavily favors him in the long run.  I need to show I'm willing to negotiate but won't accept such a disadvantageous deal."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""This is my final offer, Bob.  It factors in the inflation but remains a reasonable compromise.  Let's close this deal and avoid walking away with nothing.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

The pressure is on. This offer shows I'm willing to negotiate down slightly, acknowledging the inflation impact, but it sets a firm boundary. It's a final attempt to secure a deal that's still in my favor while emphasizing the risk of continued stalemate."
