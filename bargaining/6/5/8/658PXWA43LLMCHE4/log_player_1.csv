"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll give you $100,000 to get us off the ground. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. This is a relatively generous offer, considering the stakes are high and we have 11 more rounds to go. Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent chunk, but I'm not going for a lowball offer right off the bat. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation has already taken a bite out of my potential gain.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully. With the money being worth 10% less now, I'd be getting $300,000, which is equivalent to $270,000 in the original amount. That's a decent chunk, but I'm not sure if it's enough.

I'll reject this offer and try to do better in the next round.

Do you accept this offer?","Inflation has taken a bigger bite this time, and my potential gain is worth even less.
