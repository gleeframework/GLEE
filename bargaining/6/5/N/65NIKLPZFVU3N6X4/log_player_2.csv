"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split 60/40 Bob. This seems fair considering the inflation will hurt you more. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

While Alice's offer seems fair at first glance, it's important to consider the inflation.  Since the money will be worth less for me, I want to try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split in my favor is more fair considering the inflation will impact me more heavily. Let's try this.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'll give you a better deal than last time, but we need to settle this quickly before inflation eats away at the value. 55/45 split? 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```
While I'd still prefer a 60/40 split, inflation is starting to really hurt.  Taking 4500 is better than risking getting nothing at all."
