"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This offer gives me 60% of the initial $1,000,000, which is a relatively generous offer, considering I don't know how the inflation will affect Bob's perception of the value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain is now worth 60% of 80% of the initial $1,000,000, which is 480,000. Bob's gain is worth 50% of 90% of the initial $1,000,000, which is 450,000.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
