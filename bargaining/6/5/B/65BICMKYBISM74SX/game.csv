6000.0,4000.0,I propose dividing the $10000 with a 60/40 split in favor of Alice. This ensures both of us receive a fair share while considering the decreasing value of money over rounds.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
2000.0,8000.0,I'm willing to take a smaller share now to potentially gain more in future rounds.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Considering the inflation, I propose an equal division of the $10000. This maintains fairness and ensures that neither party loses out significantly due to the diminishing value of money.",Alice,3,

1000.0,9000.0,"I'm taking a risk by offering a small share to you, but I believe it's worth it to potentially gain a larger share in future rounds.",Bob,4,

3000.0,7000.0,"Given the inflation, I propose a 30/70 split. This balances our shares while ensuring that Bob takes a slightly larger portion, which might motivate him to agree in future rounds.",Alice,5,
