75.0,25.0,I propose dividing the $100 with a 75/25 split in favor of Alice. This offers a reasonable share while keeping some flexibility for future rounds.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
49.0,51.0,I propose a 51/49 split in my favor.  This is a fairer split considering we both have a chance to make offers in the next round. Let's end this fairly.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,accept
