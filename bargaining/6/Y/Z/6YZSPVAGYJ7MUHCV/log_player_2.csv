Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting desperate as the value of her potential winnings plummets. While her offer is getting closer to a more even split, I think I can push for a slightly better outcome in the next round.  The longer the game goes on, the more desperate Alice will become."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""message"": ""Alice, this is a very reasonable offer and very close to your last one. Let's close this deal while there's still real value left on the table.""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show willingness to compromise but keeping it  advantageous for me. The message emphasizes the urgency due to inflation, subtly pressuring Alice to accept."
