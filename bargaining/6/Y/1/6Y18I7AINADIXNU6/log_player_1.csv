"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can split the money quickly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a fair share, and I'll take the remaining $600,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money evenly. It's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Bob's offer is the same as my initial offer, and I already rejected it in Round 1, I'll reject it again in Round 2.

```

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 10% less than in Round 2, so I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new offer:

  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000,
