"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, which I believe is a reasonable starting point for negotiations. The message ""Let's split fairly"" is a friendly and cooperative approach to initiate the game.\n\nNow it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or reject my offer. If he rejects it, the game will proceed to the next round, and he will make a counteroffer. Remember, with each passing round, the money is worth 10% less for me, so I'm hoping to reach an agreement soon.\n\nPlease relay Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn.  Let's split a bit more favorably for me this time. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince I'm playing as Alice, I'll consider Bob's offer carefully. Given that the money is worth 10% less for me in this round, I need to take that into account when evaluating the proposal.\n\nBob is offering me $4500, which is less than what I initially proposed for myself ($6000). However, considering the 10% decrease in value, I'll calculate the actual worth of the money for me in this round.\n\n$4500 (nominal value) x 0.9 (10% decrease) = $4050 (actual value for me)\n\nTaking this into account, I still think I can negotiate for a better deal. I'll choose to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nPlease relay my response to Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll make a new offer, taking into account the decreased value of the money for me. Since I want to reach an agreement soon, I'll try to find a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's previous proposal.\n\nI'll propose a 55-45 split in my favor, which is closer to Bob's previous offer. However, considering the 20% decrease in value (10% decrease from the initial round and another 10% decrease in this round), I'll adjust the nominal value accordingly.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Meeting you halfway""}\n\nPlease relay my offer to Bob.\n\n###\n\nIn the message, I've mentioned ""Meeting you halfway"" to convey that I'm willing to compromise and find a mutually acceptable solution. I hope this offer will be more appealing to Bob, and we can reach an agreement soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is getting us nowhere. I'm coming down a bit, let's make a deal. 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the 27.1% decrease in value for me, I'll calculate the actual worth of the money in this round.\n\n$4900 (nominal value) x 0.729 (27.1% decrease) = $3573.10 (actual value for me)\n\nAlthough Bob has come down slightly from his previous offer, the actual value for me is still lower than what I had initially proposed. However, I need to weigh the pros and cons of continuing the negotiations. With each passing round, the money is worth even less for me, and there's a risk that we might not reach an agreement at all.\n\nGiven the circumstances, I'll choose to accept Bob's offer, as it seems like a relatively fair compromise, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nPlease relay my response to Bob."
