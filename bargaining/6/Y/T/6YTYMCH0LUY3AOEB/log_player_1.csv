"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}

I'm offering you 30 dollars, Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it for a moment...

{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}

I'll take the 60 dollars. It's a fair deal!"
