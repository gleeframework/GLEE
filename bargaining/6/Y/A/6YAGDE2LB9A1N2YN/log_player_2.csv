"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. With the 5% inflation, I'm willing to take a risk to potentially get a better deal. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I think 55-45 is a fairer split.""}\n\n###\nI've taken into account the 5% inflation for myself and the 20% inflation for Alice, and I believe this offer is more reasonable. Let's see how Alice responds!"
