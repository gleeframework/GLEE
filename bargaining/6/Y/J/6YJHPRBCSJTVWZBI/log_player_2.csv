Alice's offer:

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer at this stage is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** With only 7 rounds remaining, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly for both of us. Waiting any longer significantly risks ending up with nothing.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Even if we were to negotiate a slightly better deal in the next round or two, the losses due to inflation would likely outweigh any small gains.
* **Alice's Stance:**  Alice has presented this offer twice now, indicating it's likely her best offer.  Continuing to push for a significantly better deal might be counterproductive. 

It's better to secure a reasonable amount now than risk losing everything by being too greedy."
