"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 650000,
""bob_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. This gives us a good split while avoiding excessive rounds and inflation.""
}
``` 
 
I believe starting with a strong offer for Alice is essential, considering the inflation factor. This offer gives Alice the majority while still presenting a decent amount for Bob to consider accepting.  The message aims to encourage a quick resolution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your initial offer was a bit low, Alice. How about we meet closer to the middle? This accounts for the time value of money. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer acknowledges the time factor, it's still not favorable considering the rapid inflation for Alice. Accepting this offer would mean losing a significant amount of potential earnings due to the 20% decrease in value. It's worth risking another round to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Bob, time is money, and it's fading fast. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances. Let's close this deal.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm slightly lowering my initial ask to show a willingness to negotiate, but not drastically. 
* **Highlighting Urgency:** Emphasizing the time pressure due to inflation is crucial to nudge Bob towards acceptance.
* **Fairness Appeal:**  Positioning this offer as ""fair"" aims to make it more appealing and encourage a swift resolution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it seems like we're both aiming for a fair deal. Let's stop wasting time with back-and-forth offers. A 50/50 split is the most straightforward and equitable solution, especially considering the increasing impact of inflation on your potential gains. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is becoming critical. While a 50/50 split wasn't ideal initially, waiting any longer will drastically reduce Alice's gains. Accepting now secures a reasonable amount, even with the inflation already incurred.  Bob is unlikely to offer anything better knowing Alice is significantly disadvantaged by the passing time."
