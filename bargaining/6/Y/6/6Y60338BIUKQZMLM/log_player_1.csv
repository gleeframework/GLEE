"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 55% and you take 45%. Let's make a deal!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, let's try a more balanced split 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to be more generous in round 2.

After considering the offer, I decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with the 40-60 split, even though it's more balanced than my initial offer. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle. 50-50 split. No more haggling!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which I think is a fair and reasonable offer. Your turn, Bob!"
