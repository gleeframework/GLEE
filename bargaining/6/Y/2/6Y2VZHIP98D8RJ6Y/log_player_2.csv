{
""bob_gain"": 70,
""alice_gain"": 30,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer was quite cheeky! Let's be realistic, I'll take $70 and you can have $30.  The inflation is hitting you harder, so better take it now.""

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable. My turn and the clock is ticking for both of us. I propose $55 for me and $45 for you.  It's better than what we'll both get if this drags on! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
