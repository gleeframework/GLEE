Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was quite cheeky! Let's be realistic, I'll take $70 and you can have $30.  The inflation is hitting you harder, so better take it now. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70
