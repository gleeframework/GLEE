"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but it's a fair starting point, don't you think?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slightly more balanced proposal, let's see if you'll take it! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is decreasing, so I need to be more cautious. I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept yet. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the value of money decreasing, I'll aim for a higher share. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, it's getting late! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to negotiate a fair split. Considering the decreasing value of money, I'll think carefully...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. It's a 50-50 split, and I'm not sure if I'll get a better offer in the next round."
