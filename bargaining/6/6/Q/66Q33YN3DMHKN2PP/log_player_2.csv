Let's see what Alice offers next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}
``` 
I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. I figure we're both better off taking a deal than waiting around and risking the potential for inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though Alice's offer is slightly worse than her first offer, it's still better than risking further inflation and potentially getting nothing."
