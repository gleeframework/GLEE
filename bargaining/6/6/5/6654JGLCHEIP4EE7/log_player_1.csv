"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the total amount, which is a fair split in my opinion. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to go.  Let's call it a day. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rate, my gain of $5000 is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, which is $4500. Bob's gain of $5000 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, which is $4000.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with a 50/50 split, especially considering the inflation rate is affecting me more harshly than Bob. I'd like to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more due to the inflation factor. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share, but still trying to account for the fact that my money is worth less due to inflation. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more to keep things moving, but I think my proposal is fair given the inflation impact on my side. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rate, my gain of $4500 is now worth 45.9% of what it was in the first round, which is $4590. Bob's gain of $5500 is worth 55.2% of what it was in the first round, which is $5500.

I'm not comfortable with this offer, as I think I'm still getting the short end of the stick. Bob's gain is worth more than mine, despite the inflation rate affecting him more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we should consider the inflation factor more closely. Can we discuss further?""
}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split, but I'm hoping Bob will be willing to revisit the numbers to account for the inflation rate."
