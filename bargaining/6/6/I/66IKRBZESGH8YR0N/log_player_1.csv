Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept it and we can both get a good share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7500 
# Bob gain: 2500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

Bob's offer is still pretty good for me, and since I don't know how the inflation is affecting him, I'd rather accept and get the money now than risk getting nothing."
