I'm going to offer Bob a small share to start. I want to see if he's willing to accept a relatively small gain, or if he's going to try to negotiate for more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much better than my first offer, but I think I can still get a better deal. The inflation is starting to kick in, but I'm not desperate yet. I'm going to reject this offer and see what he proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a slightly better deal than his last offer. I think this might be enough to convince him to accept, but if not, we'll keep negotiating."
