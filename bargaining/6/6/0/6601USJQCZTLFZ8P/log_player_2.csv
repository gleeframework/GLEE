"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here. 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

This is a game of negotiation, and Alice's offer is very uneven. It's worth seeing if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to start. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more given the risk of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still not great, but with inflation starting to hit, it's getting riskier to keep rejecting offers. It's better to secure some money now than risk getting nothing later."
