"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose you take $1000, and I take $9000.  While this might seem uneven, consider that the value of the money decreases each round.  If you decline, you will be making an offer with the money worth less. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 8000,
""alice_gain"": 2000,
""message"": ""Alice, I understand the time pressure, but your initial offer was heavily skewed in your favor. Let's be realistic. This is a much fairer split considering the decreasing value.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but waiting any longer significantly diminishes the value of your share.  I'm proposing a more balanced split of $6500 for me and $3500 for you. This is a fair deal considering the time pressure. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  The value is dropping drastically with each round.  This is my final offer - let's be reasonable and end this.""}
