"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, Bob. No need to negotiate, let's get started!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn to decide!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the lead, let's start with a strong offer. You can try to do better in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting move by Bob!

Considering the inflation effect, I'll have to be strategic. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, I'll need to think carefully about whether to accept or reject.

For now, I'll decide to reject Bob's offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round, considering the inflation effect and the fact that Bob took the lead this time."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""You took the lead last round, now it's my turn. I'm offering a slightly better deal than your previous offer. Can you do better?""
}
```

I'm trying to make a counteroffer that's slightly more favorable to myself, considering the inflation effect. Now it's Bob's turn to decide!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You offered a slight improvement, but I think I can do better than that. Let's see if you can top this one. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on my gains!

Considering the significant decrease in the value of the money I gain, I'll have to be more cautious. Bob's offer is still quite lopsided, but I'm not sure if I can do better.

For now, I'll decide to reject Bob's offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round, but I'm running out of time and the inflation is making it harder to make a good offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""bob_gain"": 6000,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to find a balance between getting a good deal and not getting too greedy. Can you meet me in the middle?""
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise, considering the significant inflation effect. I'm not sure if Bob will accept, but I'm hoping to get a better deal than his previous offer."
