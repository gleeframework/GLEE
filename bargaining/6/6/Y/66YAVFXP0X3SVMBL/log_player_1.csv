"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, considering I'm starting with the first proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'd rather not accept this offer. My gain of 20$ is worth significantly less than 40$, and I'm not willing to accept such a low share. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation has reduced the value of the money, I'll make a more aggressive offer this time. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

I'm aiming for a 50/50 split, but I'm not sure if Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","With the continued inflation, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. My gain of 10$ is now worth a tiny fraction of what it was initially. I'm not willing to accept such a lopsided offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money. I'll try to be more aggressive with my offer this time. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 30,
  ""bob_gain"": 70
}
```

I'm taking a bigger share, hoping that Bob will be desperate enough to accept."
