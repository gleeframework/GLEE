Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both benefit before inflation eats away at the value. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is a tough decision, but here's why accepting is the most logical choice at this point:

* **Inflation Impact:**  The longer the game goes on, the less the money is worth to both of you, but especially to Bob. 
* **Bob's Declining Position:** Bob's offers have gone from heavily favoring him to a 50/50 split. This indicates he's feeling the pressure of the inflation and wants to settle. 
* **Future Uncertainty:**  There's no guarantee you'll get a better offer from Bob in later rounds. He might become even more desperate and offer less.

While 50/50 isn't your ideal outcome, accepting now ensures you get a reasonable share before inflation erodes the value further."
