Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate, and the inflation is heavily impacting her potential gains.  While her offer is closer to a 50/50 split, I believe I can push for a slightly better deal in the next round or two before she gets truly desperate."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Alice, time is running out! This is my final offer. Take it, and we both get something before inflation destroys the value.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  With only 6 rounds left, the pressure is on Alice. The longer she waits, the less her share is worth. 
* **Firmness:**  By stating this is my ""final offer,"" I'm signaling I'm unwilling to budge much more. This could push her to accept a deal rather than risk getting even less later. 
* **Slight Concession:** I've reduced my ask slightly from the previous round, showing some willingness to compromise."
