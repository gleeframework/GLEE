"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide it fairly""}\n\nI'm offering Bob 40% of the money, which is a relatively generous offer, considering the inflation rates. I'll wait for Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe this division is more equitable, reflecting a more balanced outcome for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nBob's offer is not acceptable to me. Although the money is worth less in this round due to inflation, I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the next round. I'll take my chances and make a counteroffer in Round 3."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll try to find a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's offer in Round 2, taking into account the decreasing value of the money due to inflation.\n{""alice_gain"": 525000, ""bob_gain"": 475000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle""}\n\nI'm hoping that this offer will be more acceptable to Bob, considering the time pressure and the decreasing value of the money. I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement before the 12 rounds are over."
