"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's divide it fairly 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While Alice's offer is generous, I want to see if I can get a better deal. There are still many rounds left, and I want to maximize my potential gains."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I believe this division is more equitable, reflecting a more balanced outcome for both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I would prefer to get a larger share,  the risk of losing everything due to the ever-increasing inflation is too high. Accepting this offer guarantees me a significant amount of money, and with the increasing inflation, trying to negotiate further is not a wise choice."
