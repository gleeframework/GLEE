# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000

This is a good time to accept the offer. Here's why:

* **Bob met your previous offer:** He's clearly willing to negotiate and has moved to your previous terms.
* **Inflation is hurting Bob more:**  While you are both losing value, Bob is losing it at a much faster rate. Delaying further significantly hurts him more than you. 
* **Time is running out:**  You're already on Round 4 of 12. The longer the game goes, the less valuable the money becomes for both of you.

Accepting now secures you a reasonable share before inflation eats away at the total value."
