"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving us both $500,000 each."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'll consider the effective value of the offer. In this case, the offer is equivalent to:

Alice gain: 400000 / 0.95 = 421052.63
Bob gain: 600000

Considering the effective values, I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 420000, ""bob_gain"": 580000}

I'm adjusting my proposal to account for the 5% decrease in value, and trying to make a more competitive offer to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another tough decision!

Since the money I gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I'll consider the effective value of the offer. In this case, the offer is equivalent to:

Alice gain: 300000 / 0.859 (1 - 0.1426) = 348571.43
Bob gain: 700000

Considering the effective values, I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 350000, ""bob_gain"": 650000}
