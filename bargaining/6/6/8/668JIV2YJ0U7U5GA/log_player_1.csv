Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair to split the money more evenly.  This offer reflects that, and gives you a chance to get a slightly bigger share before the inflation really kicks in! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
