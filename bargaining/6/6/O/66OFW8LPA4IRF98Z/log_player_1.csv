"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
```

I'm going for a very lopsided offer in the first round. My reasoning is:

* **High Stakes:** With only 12 rounds and the potential for inflation, I need to get as much as possible early.
* **Risk Aversion:** Bob might be risk-averse and accept a small amount rather than risk getting nothing in later rounds. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This will tell me if Bob is willing to negotiate or if he's going to play aggressively."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:**  The offer is worse for me than the previous round, but it's still too low. Even with inflation, I should aim for a significantly higher share.
* **Counter-Offer:**  I want to show Bob that I'm not going to accept his lopsided offers. Rejecting this will put me in a position to propose again and push for a more equitable split.
* **Negotiation:**  While the money is worth less with each round, it's still a large sum. I believe there's room for negotiation."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Fairness:** I'm offering a 60/40 split, which I believe is a reasonable starting point for a more balanced negotiation. 
* **Inflation Awareness:** While I'm willing to give up some of my initial gain, I need to secure a sizable share before inflation erodes the value of the money too much. 
* **Strategic Compromise:**  I'm showing Bob that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not willing to settle for a drastically unequal split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:** The inflation hit Bob harder than me, but his offer is still too low.  I'm holding out for a better deal.
* **Pattern Recognition:** Bob is offering a 40/60 split, which is exactly the opposite of my previous offer.  He's clearly trying to leverage the inflation to his advantage. I'm not going to fall for that.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** I need to push for a more equitable split. By rejecting this offer, I can make a counter-proposal in the next round and potentially get a better outcome."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Awareness:**  While the money is losing value, I'm still aiming for a significant share.
* **Strategic Compromise:**  I'm offering a 55/45 split, a slight concession from my last offer.  This shows flexibility while still maintaining a substantial advantage.
* **Counter-Offer Anticipation:** Bob is likely to counter with a higher offer for himself, making a 50/50 split potentially attainable in the next round. 
* **Time Pressure:** We're halfway through the rounds, so I need to get closer to a deal."
