Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal than before, but I think this is still fair given the inflation. Let's wrap this up. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation.  While his offer is slightly better, it's still heavily skewed in his favor. I need to hold out for a better deal, even though the pressure is increasing."
