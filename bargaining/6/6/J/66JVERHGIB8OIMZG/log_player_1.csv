"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take 70% and you can take 30%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair.  Let's work together to make this a win-win situation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gain, I'm now looking at a 20% reduction, so the effective amounts are:

* Alice gain: 560,000 (70% of 800,000)
* Bob gain: 600,000 (60% of 1,000,000)

Considering Bob's proposal, I'm not thrilled about the 60-40 split, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept this offer.
