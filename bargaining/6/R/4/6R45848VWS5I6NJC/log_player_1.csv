"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, it's a fair start""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $20, which is 20% of the original amount, and I'll get $80, which is 80% of the original amount. I'm framing it as a ""fair start"" to see if Bob will accept or reject the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's compromise, a 3:2 split 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustments, my gain of $40 is now worth 64% of the original amount, and Bob's gain of $60 is worth 63.6% of the original amount.

I'm not sure if this is the best I can get, but I'll consider it. I'll accept Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
