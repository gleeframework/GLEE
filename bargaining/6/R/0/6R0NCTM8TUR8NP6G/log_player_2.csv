Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: I'll take a bit more, considering inflation

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is in my favor, I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation to her advantage. While it's tempting to secure some money as it keeps devaluing for me, accepting $40 now is a raw deal. It's worth holding out a bit longer and pushing for a more equitable split, even with the inflation working against me."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""This offer is more than fair considering the circumstances. Let's be realistic and end this.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation keeps working in my favor, I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 38 
# Alice gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

The situation is getting critical, but Alice is getting greedier. While getting only $38 stings considering the initial value, accepting this offer sets a dangerous precedent. It shows Alice I am willing to accept increasingly worse deals. There's a chance she might propose something even worse next round, but there's also a chance she might realize she needs to start negotiating fairly before we both lose everything."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""This is getting ridiculous. A 50/50 split is the only fair option. Take it or leave it.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's time to play hardball.  Alice is clearly trying to take advantage, and the constantly decreasing value is putting me in a worse spot.  A firm 50/50 offer emphasizes that I'm not going to be bullied into an unfair deal, and it might be enough to get Alice to finally agree to a sensible resolution."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is severely impacting your gains, I'll take more 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough pill to swallow, but with only three rounds remaining and the value of my share rapidly approaching zero, I need to cut my losses. Accepting $35 now is better than risking getting nothing at all if Alice continues to push her advantage."
