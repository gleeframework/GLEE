Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'll start by offering a 90/10 split in my favor. It's a bold move, but I'm hoping Bob will be tempted to take it rather than risk getting a worse deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, accepting this offer is the best strategy.  I am losing 5% of the value of my potential gains with each round, while Bob is losing 10%.  Rejecting this offer risks getting a worse deal in the next round, as Bob's offer will only get better for him due to the inflation effect."
