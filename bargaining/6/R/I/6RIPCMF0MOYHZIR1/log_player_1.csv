**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting increasingly desperate, but his offer is still not good enough. The longer this goes on, the more he'll be willing to concede to avoid losing out on even more value due to the higher inflation working against him.  We're close to a tipping point where I can secure a favorable deal."
