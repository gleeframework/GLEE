"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, it's a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $100 equally, with each of us getting $50. This is a straightforward and simple offer, and I think it's a good starting point for our negotiation."

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's proposal, but I'll consider it. Since I'm not getting a fair share, I'll make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""I'm not happy with 40. I'll give you 45, and I think that's a fair compromise.""}

I'm offering Bob $45, which is a slight increase from his initial offer. I'm hoping he'll accept this compromise and we can move forward."

Round 3

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think 45 is still a fair amount considering the inflation.""}

I'm proposing that I get $55 and Bob gets $45. I'm trying to find a balance between being generous and being realistic about the value of the money."

# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the decreasing value of the money, but I'll consider Bob's offer. Since he's willing to give me a slightly bigger share, I'll think about it.

{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""I'll take 48, but I'm not thrilled about the decreasing value of the money. I hope we can find a better solution in the next round.""}

I'm accepting Bob's offer, but I'm still hoping to find a better solution in the future rounds."
