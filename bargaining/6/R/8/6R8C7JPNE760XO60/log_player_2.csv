"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","### Step 1: Understand the current situation and the rules of the game.
We are in Round 2 of the game. The total amount to be divided is $100. In each round, one player makes a proposal for division, and the other player decides whether to accept the offer or proceed to the next round to make their proposal. The value of money decreases by 0% for me (Bob) and by 10% for Alice with each passing round.

### Step 2: Analyze Alice's previous offer and the implications of rejecting it.
Alice offered to split the money evenly in Round 1, which I rejected. This means I am looking for a better deal than a 50-50 split.

### Step 3: Consider the effect of inflation on Alice's valuation of the money.
Since the money's value decreases by 10% for Alice with each round, she might be more inclined to accept a less favorable offer in later rounds. However, for me, the value of the money does not decrease, so I do not have the same pressure to accept an offer quickly.

### Step 4: Determine a reasonable offer that might be acceptable to Alice.
Given that Alice offered a 50-50 split initially and considering the effect of inflation on her valuation, I could offer her slightly less than half, anticipating that the decreasing value of money for her might make her more willing to accept a less favorable deal rather than risk getting even less in future rounds.

### Step 5: Formulate the offer and message to Alice.
I will offer Alice $45, keeping $55 for myself. The message will explain the reasoning behind the offer, emphasizing the decreasing value of money for her and the benefit of accepting the offer now rather than risking a worse deal in future rounds.

The final answer is: {""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the 10% decrease in value for you each round, I suggest we divide it 55-45. This way, you still get a significant portion, and we both avoid further devaluation risks.""}"
