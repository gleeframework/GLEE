"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. Take it while it's still worth something! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. The current offer doesn't seem fair to me, and I'm willing to take the risk of inflation to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that's more favorable to me, but still reasonable for Alice. Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Alice, I'll take that into account in my offer.

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I think this is a fairer split. Your turn, Alice!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my last offer, Bob.  We both lose if we go another round. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on my potential gain, Alice's offer is starting to look more attractive. Given that this is Alice's last offer and another round would further decrease the value of the money, I'll decide to accept this offer to avoid further losses.
