Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable, Alice. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. This accounts for the inflation that will affect you more than me. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
