"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal Bob. I think this is a fair split to start. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While the offer might seem fair at first, there's no reason to accept it on the first round. We can see how things play out by rejecting and seeing what Alice offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I'm starting with a proposal that gives us both a good starting point. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out and the value is decreasing rapidly. I'm willing to compromise, but this is my bottom line for this round. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is closer to my ideal split, I'm still holding out for a better deal. With the inflation rate, I know that each round is making my potential gains smaller. I'm going to push for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to budge a little, but this is my best offer considering the dwindling value.  Let's settle this before the money becomes even less valuable.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we need to reach an agreement soon.  This is my final offer for this round.  Let's be reasonable. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a more even split,  the value of the money is shrinking rapidly. Accepting this offer will guarantee me some profit, and continuing to reject could lead to both of us getting nothing. It's time to be pragmatic."
