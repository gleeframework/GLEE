"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can shake on it.""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount, and we can end the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm happy to take a slightly larger share this round, but I'm open to negotiating further. Let's keep this fair. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 5% less for me, so I'll have to be more cautious with my decisions.

I'll reject this offer. The money is worth less for me, and I'd like to try to get a better deal. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll try to get a better deal this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get a bit more. Can we meet in the middle?""
}
```

This way, I'll get a slightly better deal than Bob's previous offer, considering the decreasing value of money."
