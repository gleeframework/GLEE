"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, let's start with 80-20""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, 50/50 seems like the best way to split the money. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Bob, the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: 50
Bob gain: 40

I'll accept Bob's offer for the sake of moving forward, but I think I could have gotten a better deal if I had waited a bit longer!
