"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept and we can split the money evenly, or I'll make a better offer next round""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount, but it's a good starting point. My message is a gentle nudge to see if Bob will accept the offer and end the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share this round, but I'll make it up to you later 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is already starting to lose value. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm not willing to accept a significantly lower share, especially since the money is worth less with each passing round. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""You're not making it up to me, let's split it more fairly this round""
}
```

I'm increasing my share to 700,000, which is a more significant portion of the remaining amount. My message is a reminder that I'm not willing to accept a highly uneven split, and I'm hoping Bob will meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal this round, but I'm not giving up yet 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value rapidly! Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again because the share I'm getting is still too small, and the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. I'm hoping Bob will make a more substantial offer soon."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not getting any younger, let's split it closer to 50/50 this round""
}
```

I'm increasing my share to 600,000, which is a more even split. My message is a gentle reminder that time is running out, and I'm hoping Bob will meet me halfway to avoid losing even more value due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway this round, but I'm not giving up my advantage yet 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of Bob's share is decreasing rapidly, but he's finally meeting me halfway! Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer because it's a 50/50 split, which is the most even split we've had so far. I'm hoping that we can both end the game on a good note and split the remaining value of the money fairly."
