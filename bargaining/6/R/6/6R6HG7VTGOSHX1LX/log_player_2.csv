Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting closer, but I still want a bit more 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is stubbornly sticking close to her initial offer, clearly banking on my impatience due to inflation. However, accepting 43 dollars after 5 rounds is a terrible deal.  I need to show her I'm serious about getting a fair share, even with the inflation working against me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""This is my final offer. Take it, or we both lose out.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Time is running out, and I need to signal I'm willing to compromise, but not be walked all over. This offer is still better than anything she's proposed, and the ""final offer"" wording adds weight to the decision. She might get greedy and push her luck, but there's a real risk now that she'll walk away with nothing."
