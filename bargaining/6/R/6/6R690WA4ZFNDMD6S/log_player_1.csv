Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 60, you can have 40. It's a good starting point, and we can adjust in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 40

Do you accept this offer?","{
