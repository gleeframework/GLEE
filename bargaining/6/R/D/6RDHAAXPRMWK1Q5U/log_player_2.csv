Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle? 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is getting closer to a more even split, but it's still in her favor. Since the inflation is hitting her harder than me, I'm willing to gamble that she'll be more desperate for a deal in the next few rounds."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""The clock is ticking, Alice. This is a good deal for both of us.""}"
