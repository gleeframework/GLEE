"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 

I'm starting with a proposal that gives me the majority, but still leaves Bob with something. I want to see how he responds, but I also want to keep the possibility open for negotiation in the future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. Although I lose a significant amount of money due to inflation, I'm not willing to accept such an unfair deal. I will propose my own offer in the next round, hoping to get a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}
```

I'm going to propose a 45/55 split. This is a significant shift from my previous offer, but I'm hoping it will demonstrate my willingness to negotiate and still allows Bob to gain a substantial portion of the money.  I believe this offers a fair compromise given the inflation and Bob's previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept this offer.  While it's not ideal, the inflation is hitting me hard and I need to secure some money before it's too late. I'll take the $40 and hope I can make it last."
