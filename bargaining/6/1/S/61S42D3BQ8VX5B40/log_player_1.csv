"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point.""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets the remaining 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly bigger share this time, but I still think I deserve a bit more. 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'm willing to consider it. If I accept, I'll get $70, which is still a bit less than I wanted. On the other hand, it's a better offer than the first one, and I don't want to risk going to the next round.
