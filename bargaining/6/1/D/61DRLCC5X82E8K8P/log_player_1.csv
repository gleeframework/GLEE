"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start with, a fair and simple way to begin.""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving each of us $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take a slightly larger share this time! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not happy about Bob's increased demands, but I'll consider it. Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll think about it...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
