"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being fair, but you'll have a chance to get more later if you want to risk it. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible offer! While Alice is framing it as generous, I'm losing out on a significant chunk of the money. I'm willing to gamble that I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Alice. This is a fair split.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob.  We both need to get something out of this. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is getting ridiculous! Alice is just mirroring my previous offer, which wasn't even that generous to her in the first place.  The longer this goes on, the more we both lose to inflation. I'll make one more attempt to be reasonable before I start making riskier demands."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""This is my final offer, Alice. Take it or leave it, but we're both losing money the longer this goes on.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're both losing money fast. Let's just split it evenly and call it a day. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

It's not ideal, but at this point, accepting a 50/50 split is the smartest move.  Inflation is eating away at the value, and it's better to take a sure thing now than risk getting even less later."
