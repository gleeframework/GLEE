45.0,55.0,"I'm willing to give you a bit more, Alice.  Since the money is worth less to you, I figure 55/45 is a fair split.  Let's end this now.",Bob,2,

40.0,60.0,"Alice,  I understand the situation is changing quickly for you, but I'm still offering you a fair deal. We can call it even, you take $40, I'll take $60.  Let's avoid further delays.",Bob,4,
