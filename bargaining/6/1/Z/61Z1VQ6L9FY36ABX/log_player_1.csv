"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 999,999,
  ""bob_gain"": 1,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this over with, I'll give you a dollar to seal the deal""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a paltry $1, and I'll take the remaining $999,999. The message is a bit cheeky, but I'm trying to get the deal done quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, it's a fair deal! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","A 50/50 split is a reasonable offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer for now and see if I can do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to see if I can get a better deal. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting the better deal, take it or leave it""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share, but I'm still leaving him with a decent amount of money. The message is a bit confrontational, but I'm trying to assert my bargaining power."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but not too much! 
# Alice gain: 625000 
# Bob gain: 375000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is starting to take its toll, and Bob's offer is getting more generous. I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer. The 625,000 I'll get is still a significant amount, and I'm not sure if I can do better in the next round."
