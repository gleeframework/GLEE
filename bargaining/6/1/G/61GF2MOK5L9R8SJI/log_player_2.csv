"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, slightly in my favor since I'm making the first move. This ensures we both benefit from a deal early on. 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for a better offer. The difference is too much in Alice's favor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'll take a bit more since I'm making the second offer and the money is worth less now.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The longer this goes on, the less we both get. I propose a fair 50/50 split to avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nA 50/50 split is fair, and with inflation, it's better to accept this offer rather than risking further devaluation of the money."
