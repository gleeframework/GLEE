"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\nI'll start by offering a 60-40 split in my favor, which I think is a reasonable starting point for negotiations. I'm open to adjusting the split in future rounds if Bob is not satisfied with this proposal. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we should aim for a more even split. This way we both get a good starting point. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject Bob's offer because, considering the 10% decrease in value due to inflation, I believe I can negotiate for a better split in the next rounds. The current offer of a 40-60 split in Bob's favor does not seem appealing, especially since I started with a more generous offer in the first round. Let's proceed to the next round and see if we can reach a more mutually agreeable division."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll offer a 55-45 split in my favor, taking into account the decreased value of the money due to inflation. I believe this is a reasonable compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. Let's see how Bob responds!
