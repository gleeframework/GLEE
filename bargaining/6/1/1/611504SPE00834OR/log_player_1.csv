"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $4000, and I'll take $6000.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'll give you a decent chunk. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, the money I gain is now worth 95% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 90% of what it was in the first round.

Since Bob's offer is 8000, that's 90% of 8888.88 (which is 10,000 * 0.9), and my gain is 2000, which is 95% of 2105.26 (which is 6000 * 0.95).

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counter-proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Your offer is too skewed towards you. I'll make a new proposal.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not giving up too much. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a more balanced split, but still keeping some advantage for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slight edge, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking its toll!

Considering the new values, my gain of 4500 is 85.74% of 5263.16 (which is 6000 * 0.8857), and Bob's gain of 5500 is 61.9% of 8888.88 (which is 10,000 * 0.619).

I'll accept Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Okay, I'll take it. It's a fair deal considering the inflation.""
}
