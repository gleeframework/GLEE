"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. While I value fairness, the risk of inflation means we should both take a more balanced approach. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{
