"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a very lopsided offer in my favor.  Since the money is worth less to Bob with each passing round, I want to lock in as much as possible early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get more, the money is worth less with each round for Bob, so he's likely to become more and more aggressive in his offers. Accepting a 50/50 split is a reasonable outcome in this scenario."
