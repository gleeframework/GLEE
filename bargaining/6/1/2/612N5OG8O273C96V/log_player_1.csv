"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}

I'm offering Bob $300,000, which is a relatively low amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept it to avoid proceeding to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less, the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: 500000 / 0.8 = 625000
Bob gain: 500000 / 0.8 = 625000

I'll accept this offer.
