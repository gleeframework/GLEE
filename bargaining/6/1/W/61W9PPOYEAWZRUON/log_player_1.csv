"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""I'll take all the money, but I'll let you have a smile""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will reject this offer and we can proceed to the next round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous.  Take $10 and let's move on. 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

I'm not sure I want to accept an offer that leaves me with only $10. I'd like to try to get a bit more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more reasonable offer this time. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's split it 4:1""
}
```"
