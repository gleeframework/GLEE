"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  Since I'm the first to propose, I'm going to take the majority of the money.  I'll see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation means my 90 dollar gain is now worth only 72 dollars.  It's better to take Bob's offer and get 70 dollars than to risk getting nothing if we keep playing."
