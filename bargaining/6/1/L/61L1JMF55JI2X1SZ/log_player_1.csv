"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! Take 20, I'll take 80.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20 dollars and keeping 80 dollars for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better for both of us.  Let's split it more evenly.   
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 5% less, the actual amounts are:

* Alice's gain: 45 * 0.95 = 42.75
* Bob's gain: 55 * 0.95 = 52.25

I think this is a more reasonable split, so I'll accept the offer.
