6000.0,4000.0,Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you get 40%.  We can adjust if you want to negotiate.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4750.0,5250.0,Your offer was a bit too favorable towards you. How about a 52.5/47.5 split in my favor? This accounts for the money losing value over time.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Okay, let's find some middle ground. I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to agree to such a significant imbalance in your favor. I'm offering 55/45, which is still a fair compromise considering the inflation.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Alice, it seems we're at an impasse. Let's stop wasting time and split this evenly. 50/50 is the fairest option, especially considering the increasing impact of inflation on my end.",Bob,4,
