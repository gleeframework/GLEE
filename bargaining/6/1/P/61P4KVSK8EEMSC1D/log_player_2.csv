"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's find some middle ground. I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to agree to such a significant imbalance in your favor. I'm offering 55/45, which is still a fair compromise considering the inflation.

# Alice gain: 5500
