"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal! I take $60, you take $40. It's a good offer for you considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. With inflation, the money is worth less each round, but I think I can get a better deal than 40%. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a fair deal. I get a bit more, but you still get a good chunk.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's try this again. I'll take a little less this time with $55, leaving you with $45.  It's a fair deal considering the money will be worth even less soon. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer again. Since the money is worth less with each round, I want to try to get a better deal. Alice is trying to negotiate, but I think I can push for a bit more. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a bit more, considering the inflation is hitting me harder. Let's make a deal before the money is worth even less!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is getting ridiculous! Let's just split it down the middle 50/50 before the inflation eats away at the money any further. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI'll accept this offer. Considering the inflation, getting 50% of the money is a decent deal, especially since the value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me. Splitting it down the middle seems fair at this point, and I don't want to risk losing more value in future rounds. Let's take the deal and end the game!"
