"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 

This offer is designed to be highly advantageous to me (Alice). I'm aiming to secure almost the entire sum, leaving Bob with a token amount. It's a risky move, but it increases my chances of winning in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I initially aimed for a more favorable outcome, the inflation factor makes this offer very appealing.  Getting 500,000 is much better than risking getting nothing in the next round."
