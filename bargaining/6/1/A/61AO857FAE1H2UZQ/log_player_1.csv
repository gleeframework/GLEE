Bob is still not acknowledging the impact of inflation on my gains. While the risk is increasing, accepting such a low offer now would set a bad precedent for future rounds. I need to stand my ground a bit longer."

This is getting ridiculous. Bob is clearly trying to exploit the situation and pressure me into accepting a low offer by using fear tactics. I need to hold my ground. There's still a chance he'll come around in the remaining rounds."

This is incredibly frustrating. Bob is sticking to his strategy of lowballing while emphasizing the risk. However, accepting this offer would mean losing a significant portion of the potential gain. I have to gamble that he understands the severity of the situation in these final rounds."

It's painful, but I have to accept.  Bob has played hardball, and going any further means we both get nothing. It's a significant loss compared to my earlier offers, but it's better than walking away empty-handed."
