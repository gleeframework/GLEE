"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This way, I get the majority of the money, but still give Bob a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain is worth even less, so I'll try to get more this time. I'll reject Bob's offer.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll try to get more this time. Given that the money is worth 40% less than in the first round, I'll aim for a bigger share. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth even less now, and Bob's offer is quite generous compared to the previous round. I'll accept this offer to get something, rather than risking a worse deal in the next round.
