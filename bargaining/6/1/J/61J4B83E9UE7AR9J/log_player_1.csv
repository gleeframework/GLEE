"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the original $10,000, and I'll take the remaining 60%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, my original offer would have been worth 48,000, so I'm not as eager to settle for the same amount as the first round.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to do better.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll try to make a better offer this time. Considering the inflation, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the reduced value of money.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is getting less valuable by the round. Considering the reduced value, I'll think carefully about Bob's new offer.

If I accept this offer, I'll get $4000, which is worth 40% of the original $10,000. Considering the inflation, that's actually a pretty good deal.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
