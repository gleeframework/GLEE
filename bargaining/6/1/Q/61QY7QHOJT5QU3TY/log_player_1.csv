"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a decent amount""
}
```

This offer gives me 90% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob gets 10%. The message is a friendly one, trying to set a positive tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, I think an even split is the most reasonable starting point. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the actual amounts I would gain in this round are:

* My gain: 450,000 (90% of 500,000)
* Bob's gain: 450,000

Considering the offer, I think an even split is a bit too generous for me, considering I'm the one making the next proposal. I'd like to try to get a better deal. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth 10% less than in round 2, so the actual amounts I would gain are:

* My gain: 405,000 (90% of 450,000)
* Bob's gain: 405,000

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more""
}
```

This offer gives me a slightly higher share, but still leaves Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a slightly higher share for me is fair, given the inflation and the fact that we're both playing strategically now. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","In round 4, the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, so the actual amounts I would gain are:

* My gain: 324,000 (90% of 360,000, which is 27.1% of 1,200,000)

Considering the offer, I think Bob is trying to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth less. However, I'm not sure if I want to give him a larger share now. I'll reject this offer.
