I'm going for a very lopsided deal in the first round. I'm hoping Bob will be surprised and accept it, but I'm also prepared for the possibility of many rounds of negotiation.  Let's see what happens!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer. Even though I'm losing money due to inflation, I'm not going to give up 99% of the money! I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm offering a 50/50 split this time. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob, given that we've both already rejected a very uneven split.  Let's see if he's willing to settle for a fair deal."
