"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, 60-40. You can try to negotiate if you want more.""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a relatively generous starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve more since I'm the one making the proposal this time. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still quite lopsided in his favor. I think I can do better than a 70-30 split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the original amount. Let's try 42-58.""
}
```

I'm offering a 42-58 split, which is a bit more in my favor, but still a compromise. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still willing to compromise, but I think 42-58 is too far off from my original proposal. Let's try to meet in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about Bob's new offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. A 45-55 split is a reasonable compromise, and I think it's a fair meeting in the middle. I'm willing to end the game here."
