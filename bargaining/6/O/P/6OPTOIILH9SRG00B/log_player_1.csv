"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but still trying to keep some for myself 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure's on!

Considering the inflation, my gain of $6,000 is actually worth 90% of the original $8,000 I was offered in Round 1, which is a bit of a reduction. However, Bob's gain of $4,000 is worth 80% of the original $5,000 he would have kept in Round 1, which is a bigger reduction.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a bit stingy, I'll try to make a more generous offer to try to get him to accept and end the game quickly.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle. Let's split it fairly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, hoping he'll see it as a fair compromise and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much 
# Alice gain: 6500 
# Bob gain: 3500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is taking a toll!

Considering the inflation, my gain of $6,500 is worth 65% of the original $10,000, which is a significant reduction. However, Bob's gain of $3,500 is worth 35% of the original $10,000, which is also a substantial reduction.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, but I'll think carefully about it...

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
