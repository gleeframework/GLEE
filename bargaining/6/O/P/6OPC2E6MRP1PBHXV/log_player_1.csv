"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\n###\n\nI offered Bob $450,000, which is less than half, but still a significant amount. I also included a message ""Let's be fair"" to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept the offer.\n\nYour turn! What will Bob decide?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better.  Let's split it more evenly. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince I offered Bob $450,000 in the first round and he rejected it, I'm not willing to accept the same amount now, especially considering the 10% decrease in value due to inflation. I think I can do better than that.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nLet's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll try to find a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll adjust the amounts accordingly.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 520000, ""bob_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\nI'm offering Bob a bit more than I did initially, while still keeping a larger share for myself. The message ""Meet me in the middle"" is an attempt to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and compromise.\n\nYour turn! What will Bob decide?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 52/48, it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the significant decrease in value due to inflation (27.1% for me and 14.26% for Bob), I think it's time to reassess the situation. Bob's offer of a 52/48 split is not ideal, but it's a relatively fair compromise, and the difference between our gains is not as significant as it was in previous rounds.\n\nGiven the circumstances, I'm willing to accept Bob's offer and end the game.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}"
