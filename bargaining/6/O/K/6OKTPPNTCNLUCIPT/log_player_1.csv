"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This is a generous offer, considering I'm offering Bob a significant share of the money right off the bat. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money has decreased due to inflation, so my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round.

I'll have to decide whether to accept Bob's offer or reject it and make a counteroffer. Considering the decrease in value, I'll try to negotiate a better deal.

I'll reject Bob's offer.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 90% of its original value after the first round and another 10% decrease due to inflation, the total value of the money is now 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 or 81% of its original value.

Considering this, my new offer is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8200,
  ""bob_gain"": 1800
}
```

This offer takes into account the decreased value of the money and gives me a slightly higher share, but still leaves Bob with a decent amount. Let's see if Bob accepts this offer!"
