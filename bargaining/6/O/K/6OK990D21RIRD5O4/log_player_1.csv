"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm offering you 40 dollars, which is a generous offer considering the inflation factor. What do you say?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my offer is now worth even less. I'll have to be more careful.

I accept Bob's offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```
I'll take the 55 dollars and call it a day!"
