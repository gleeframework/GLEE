"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose that I take $900,000 and Bob takes $100,000. This is a fair starting point, as I am taking the majority, but still leaving Bob with a decent sum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I propose a 50/50 split. Since Bob rejected my previous offer, I believe a fair compromise is to split the money evenly."
