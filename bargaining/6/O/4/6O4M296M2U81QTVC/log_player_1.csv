"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was tempting, but let's be realistic. Time is money, and we both lose value with each passing round. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. It's a strong offer that allows us both to walk away with something substantial. Take it while it's still on the table! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
