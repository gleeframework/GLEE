"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split this evenly. It's the fairest solution, and with inflation, we both lose if we keep going. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 

While I could try to negotiate for more, accepting a 50/50 split now is a safe bet.  Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  Bob's offer is actually more valuable to him in this round than it was in the first round due to inflation. 
* **Future Uncertainty:** If I reject, there's no guarantee I can secure a better deal in a future round. Bob might get more aggressive with his offers as the inflation impacts him.

A sure $500,000 is better than the risk of ending up with less."
