Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a reasonable compromise considering the time pressure and the decreasing value. Let's settle this before it's too late. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the pressure is on, Alice's offers are getting worse for her due to the rapid inflation hitting her value. I'm betting she'll get more desperate and offer a larger share to avoid getting nothing."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time.  A 50/50 split is the fairest option. Take it before the value drops even further.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Offering a 50/50 split now accomplishes a few things:

* **Projects Fairness:** It makes Bob appear reasonable and willing to compromise. 
* **Highlights Urgency:**  The message emphasizes the rapidly dwindling value, putting pressure on Alice to accept.
* **Potential Turning Point:** This offer could be a psychological turning point, making Alice realize that Bob is serious about getting a fair deal and won't back down significantly."
