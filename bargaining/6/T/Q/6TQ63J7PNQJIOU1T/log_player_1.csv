"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take a slight majority""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%. I'm framing it as a ""fair"" split, but with a slight bias towards me. Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the smaller share, but I'm willing to consider it.

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll take Bob's offer of 70% and leave 30% for him. It's not my ideal split, but it's still a decent deal considering the inflation and the fact that I have to make a decision quickly."
