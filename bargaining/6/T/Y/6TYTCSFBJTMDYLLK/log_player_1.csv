"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
``` 
 
I'm proposing a 50/50 split. It's the fairest way to start, and we can see if either of us wants to negotiate from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

I'm increasing my share slightly to 55, reflecting the inflation.  I'm still willing to be fair, but I need to account for the decreased value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is still less than my initial proposal, the inflation is making it a much riskier proposition to keep rejecting.  Accepting this offer is better than risking getting nothing at all."
