"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and inviting Bob to make the next move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a higher percentage, but you have to accept now! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less, my gain of $40 is actually $38 in terms of real value.

I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I'm willing to accept it to get some money now rather than risking it all in future rounds. I'll take the deal.
