Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.

**Explanation:**

* **Inflation:** Even though Alice's offer is less than my previous offer, it's important to consider the inflation. 
* **My Loss:** My gain is worth 9.75% less than the first round, which is a significant loss.
* **Alice's Loss:** Alice's gain is worth 19% less, a much larger loss for her.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** If I reject this offer, the next round might offer a better deal, but it also risks further inflation and a potentially worse deal. 

It's a calculated risk, but accepting this offer seems like the best option to minimize my losses in this scenario."
