"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we each get $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'll still give you a decent share 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with Bob's offer. He's taking 80% of the total amount, leaving me with only 20%. I was hoping for a more balanced split. I'll reject this offer and wait for a better one."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3

{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""I'll compromise and give you a bigger share, but I still want a decent chunk""}

I'm proposing a 40/60 split, where I'll take $400,000 and Bob will take $600,000. I'm trying to find a middle ground and give Bob a slightly larger share, but still keep a significant portion for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'll give you a small consolation prize 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm extremely unhappy with Bob's offer. He's taking 90% of the total amount, leaving me with only 10%. The consolation prize of $100,000 is hardly worth considering. I was hoping for a more balanced split, and this offer is not even close. I'll reject this offer and wait for a better one."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 300000, ""bob_gain"": 700000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a bigger share, but I still want a significant chunk""}

I'm proposing a 30/70 split, where I'll take $300,000 and Bob will take $700,000. I'm trying to find a compromise and give Bob a larger share, but I still want to keep a substantial portion for myself."
