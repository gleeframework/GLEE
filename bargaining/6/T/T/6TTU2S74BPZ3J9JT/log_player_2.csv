"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money evenly. It's fair and simple. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I want to see if I can get a better deal, especially since I know about the inflation.  Let's see what Alice offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think it's fair to take into account the potential for inflation. I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I believe this will be more beneficial for both of us in the long run.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I've adjusted my offer based on the previous round's outcome. I'm proposing a split that takes inflation into account, with a slight increase in my portion. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a more even split, accepting this offer is the most strategic choice. I've already lost some value due to inflation, and rejecting this could lead to further losses. It's better to secure a decent share now than risk getting nothing later."
