"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's offer was 40$ for me and 60$ for her, I'll try to offer a bit more to me this time. However, I'll keep in mind that the money is worth 0% less for me, but 20% less for Alice, so I'll offer her a smaller amount.

{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Alice is now offering an equal split, I'll accept this offer. I think it's a fair deal considering the inflation has reduced the value of her share.
