"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this fair split and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can avoid the risk of inflation reducing the value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split this evenly. No need to play this game any longer. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less, the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: 5000 / 0.8 = 6250
Bob gain: 5000 / 0.8 = 6250

I'll accept this offer. The even split is reasonable, and I'd rather end the game now than risk losing more value with each passing round.
