"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects the time pressure we both face. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that takes into account the time pressure and inflation for both of us. Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Alice after each round, I need to adjust the offer accordingly. I'll aim for a more balanced split this time, considering the decreasing value of money for both of us.\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 420000, ""alice_gain"": 580000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation impact, let's adjust the split to make it more balanced as we both lose value over time.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your offer doesn't reflect the faster rate at which your share loses value. This is a fair compromise considering the time pressure. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI still think the offer doesn't fully consider the impact of inflation on my share. Given that my money loses value faster, I believe I should get a larger share to compensate for this loss.\n\n###\n\nLet's proceed to the next round and see if we can find a better compromise.\n\n###\n\nYour turn!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","As we're in the fourth round, I need to take into account the increasing impact of inflation on both our shares. Since my share loses value at a faster rate, I'll adjust the offer to reflect this.\n\n###\n\nConsidering the current loss of value, I'll propose a split that slightly favors me to compensate for the higher rate of inflation on my share. However, I'll also ensure that Alice's share is substantial, acknowledging the time pressure and her loss of value as well.\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 480000, ""alice_gain"": 520000, ""message"": ""Given the increasing impact of inflation, this split adjusts for the faster rate of loss on my share while ensuring you still receive a significant amount considering the time pressure.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time. This is my final offer - it accounts for the inflation but is still heavily weighted in your favor given the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nGiven the significant impact of inflation on my share, with it being worth 59.04% less than in the first round, and considering we're halfway through the rounds, I believe accepting this offer is the most prudent decision. The risk of proceeding and potentially ending up with nothing due to not reaching an agreement before the 12 rounds are over outweighs the potential benefits of trying to negotiate for a slightly better deal. Alice's offer seems to be a compromise, taking into account the time pressure and the differing rates of inflation for both of us. Proceeding further could lead to diminishing returns, making this offer the most reasonable choice at this stage."
