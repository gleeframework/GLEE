"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's share fairly""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I, Alice, am proposing to take $6000, which is 60% of the total amount, and Bob will receive $4000, which is 40% of the total amount. The message to Bob is ""Let's share fairly."" I am hoping that Bob will accept this offer, considering that the money's value decreases for me with each passing round, but remains the same for Bob. This division seems fair because it acknowledges the unequal impact of inflation on our gains.\n\n###\n\nYour turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'd like a fairer split. Let's go with 60/40 in my favor since I'm taking the risk of rejection. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI, Alice, reject Bob's offer because, despite the inflation affecting my gain, accepting 40% of the original amount ($4000) seems too low, especially considering I started by offering Bob 40% in the first round. The message from Bob mentions a ""fairer split,"" but with the impact of inflation, this division becomes even more skewed in his favor. I'll proceed to the next round, hoping for a better offer or the chance to propose a more balanced division again.\n\n###\n\nLet's move to Round 3!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet halfway""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I, Alice, propose taking $5800, while Bob receives $4200. Given the inflation that has reduced the value of my potential gain over the rounds, I'm trying to find a middle ground that would be acceptable to both of us. The message ""Considering inflation, let's meet halfway"" aims to convey the impact of the decreasing value on my end and the hope for a compromise that recognizes this factor.\n\n###\n\nYour turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: With inflation hitting Alice harder, I think this split is more fair. Let's end this game. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI, Alice, reject Bob's offer because, although the inflation has significantly reduced the value of my potential gain, accepting $3500 (which is 35% of the original amount) still seems too low, especially considering the progressive offers made in previous rounds. Bob's message suggests that the split is more fair due to the inflation affecting me harder, but I believe there's still room for negotiation to achieve a more balanced division. I'll proceed to the next round, hoping for a better offer or the chance to propose a more equitable division again.\n\n###\n\nLet's move to Round 5!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nI, Alice, realize that the game has reached a critical point with significant loss due to inflation. To expedite the process and potentially secure an agreement, I'll make a slightly more favorable offer to Bob while still aiming for a reasonable share for myself.\n\n###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5600, ""bob_gain"": 4400, ""message"": ""Final attempt at fairness considering inflation""}\n\n###\n\nThis offer proposes that I take $5600, and Bob receives $4400. The message ""Final attempt at fairness considering inflation"" conveys my intention to conclude the negotiations with a division that acknowledges the impact of inflation on my potential gain while also being more generous to Bob than my previous offers.\n\n###\n\nYour turn, Bob!"
