"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

I'm going for a very aggressive first offer.  I'm confident that Bob will not accept this, but it sets the stage for me to be the proposer in the next round. I'm hoping to get a better deal with less risk of him accepting this wildly uneven split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly better than my first offer, but I'm not ready to accept it yet. I'm still confident that I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm increasing my offer to be more reasonable. This split offers a fair share to Bob, but still leaves me with the majority.  I'm hopeful he'll see the value in this deal, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my target, but I'm still not willing to settle for less than half the money.  I think I can get a better deal if we keep negotiating."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm offering an even split this round.  The inflation is starting to take a serious toll, and I don't want to risk getting a worse deal later on.  This is a fair compromise and I believe it's the best way to maximize our potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse, but I'm still not willing to accept it. I'm holding out for a more even split, hoping that the inflation will eventually force him to accept my offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000}
```

I'm sticking with a slightly uneven split in my favor, acknowledging the inflation's impact, but still striving for a good outcome for myself.  This offers a reasonable split, and I believe it's the best way to secure a decent share while still maintaining a chance for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It seems like we've reached a stalemate. The inflation is seriously affecting the value of the money, and Bob's offer, while still not ideal, is the best I can reasonably expect at this point. Accepting it guarantees me a significant amount of money, and further negotiations are too risky with the shrinking value."
