Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money into two parts: you get $250,000 and I get $750,000. This way, we can both benefit from the initial division.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a more balanced split.  You get $400000 and I get $600000. This is a fair starting point that gives us both a good share. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
