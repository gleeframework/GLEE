"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 525000,
""bob_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""This offer gives us both a reasonable and relatively equal share, Bob. Let's settle this quickly before inflation erodes the value.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Understanding Time Sensitivity:**  Both Alice and Bob lose money due to inflation with each passing round. It's in Alice's best interest to secure a deal quickly.
* **Bob's Perspective:** Bob's money loses value faster (10% per round) than Alice's (5%). He's incentivized to accept a somewhat fair deal sooner rather than later.
* **Opening Offer Strategy:**  While aiming for a slightly favorable outcome, Alice's opening offer is designed to be tempting to Bob while still securing a significant portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was quite fair Alice, but now it's my turn. Let's wrap this up. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is simply a reversal of Alice's initial offer. While it might seem tempting to end the game quickly, accepting this deal would mean Alice loses out on potential gains compared to her initial proposal. 

Here's why:

* **Time is still on Alice's side (slightly):** Bob's money is devaluating at twice the rate of Alice's. By rejecting this offer, Alice increases the pressure on Bob for the next round. 
* **Setting a precedent:** Accepting this offer might signal to Bob that Alice is willing to accept unfavorable deals, potentially leading to worse offers in future rounds.

Alice should come back with a counter-offer that still holds some appeal for Bob (considering his faster devaluation) but moves closer to her desired outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. This back and forth is only hurting us both. A 50/50 split is the fairest and fastest way to end this.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Applying Pressure:** Bob is now very aware of the inflation working against him. Alice offering an even split emphasizes that further negotiation might not yield a significantly better outcome for him before the value drops further.
* **Appearing Reasonable:**  By proposing a 50/50 split, Alice demonstrates fairness and a desire to end the negotiation quickly. This makes it harder for Bob to justify dragging out the game for a potentially marginal gain. 
* **Simplicity and Finality:** A clean split removes any complexity and sends a clear message: it's time to agree and move on."
