"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, Bob.  I'm sure we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Please let me know when it's my turn!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think we can do better than that, let's try a 55-45 split!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time, Bob. It's a fair deal and avoids any more back-and-forth. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI think accepting the 50-50 split is a good idea, considering the inflation and the fact that further rounds will only decrease the value of the money. It's a fair deal, and I'm happy to end the game here!"
