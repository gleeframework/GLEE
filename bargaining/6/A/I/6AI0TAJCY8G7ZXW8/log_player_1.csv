"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $4,000 and keep $6,000 for myself.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game early!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet you in the middle, let's split it 50/50 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $5,000 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, so it's effectively $4,000.

I'll reject Bob's offer. I'd rather not split it 50/50, especially since my gain is worth less due to inflation. I'll wait for a better offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my goal is to get a higher share of the money to compensate for the decrease in value. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I need to account for the inflation. I'll give you $3,000 and keep $7,000 for myself.""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will see the value in getting a slightly larger share, considering the decreasing value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting a smaller share, I'm keeping more, but it's still a good deal for you 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $4,000 is worth 40% of what it was in the first round, so it's effectively $2,000.

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'll consider it. I'm getting a smaller share, but at least it's still a proposal. I'll accept this offer, hoping that Bob will keep his word and we can finally end the game.
