I'm starting with a very aggressive offer, hoping to secure almost all the money in the first round.  Let's see if Bob is willing to accept such a small share!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob is being very greedy! I'm going to reject this offer. While 100,000 is a lot of money, I can likely get a better deal in the future rounds, especially with the inflation decreasing my potential gains."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm going for a 50/50 split this time.  It's a fair offer that hopefully Bob will see as a good compromise. With inflation kicking in, it's not a great idea to be too greedy and risk getting nothing at all."
