Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm taking almost everything, leaving Bob with just $1.  Since I'm not sure how inflation affects him, I want to maximize my share in the first round.  This is a risky strategy, as Bob could reject and we'll both get less in the next round, but it's a gamble worth taking."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It's better to take the 500,000 now.  While I could potentially get more in the next round, I don't know how the inflation is affecting Bob and how that will influence his offers. It's too risky to keep going."
