**Reasoning:** Alice is getting desperate, and her offers are becoming increasingly worse for her due to inflation.  I'm willing to push my luck a little further and see if I can secure an even better deal in the next round."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Okay, Alice, let's stop wasting time. This is a perfectly even split. Take it or leave it.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** It's time to apply more pressure and go for a 50/50 split.  While I could try to squeeze more out of Alice, the risk of getting nothing is increasing significantly as we approach the halfway point. A 50/50 split ensures I get a reasonable amount and avoids the risk of walking away with nothing."
