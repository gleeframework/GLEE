"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

This way, I'll get 80% of the initial amount, and Bob will get 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced values, my gain of 400,000 is worth 320,000 in the original amount, and Bob's gain of 600,000 is worth 570,000 in the original amount.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
