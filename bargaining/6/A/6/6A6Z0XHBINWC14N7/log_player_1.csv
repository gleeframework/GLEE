"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This is a generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can avoid further negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth less. I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since Bob is offering a 50-50 split, I'll decide to...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Bob's offer was a 50-50 split, I'll try to do better. Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of money. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This offer gives me a slightly larger share, but still leaves Bob with a decent amount. Let's see if he'll accept!"
