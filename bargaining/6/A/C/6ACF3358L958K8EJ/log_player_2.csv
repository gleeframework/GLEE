Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's be reasonable. I understand you want a good deal, but the value for both of us is decreasing with each round. I propose a fair 50/50 split. Let's end this before inflation eats away at our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
