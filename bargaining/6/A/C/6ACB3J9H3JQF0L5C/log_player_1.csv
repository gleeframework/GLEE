"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems like a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting Bob's gain, I'll have to be cautious. My initial offer was 50-50, and now Bob is proposing a 40-60 split in his favor. I'll reject this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer was 40-60 in his favor, I'll try to adjust my offer to make it more favorable to me. Considering the inflation, I'll propose a slightly more uneven split.

# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking its toll! Bob's offer is now 35-65 in his favor, which is even more skewed than his previous offer. I'll have to think carefully about this one.

Since my offer was rejected in the previous round, I'll try to be more aggressive this time. I'll propose a slightly more extreme split, hoping Bob will accept it.
