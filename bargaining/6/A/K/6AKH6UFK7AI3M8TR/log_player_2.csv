Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share, but you get a small piece to show good faith. We can work out something better later. 
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","That's a pretty bold opening offer from Alice. I'm not sure I'm comfortable with giving her 99% of the money upfront. I'd like to reject this offer and see if I can negotiate a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Time to make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll take that into account when making my offer.
