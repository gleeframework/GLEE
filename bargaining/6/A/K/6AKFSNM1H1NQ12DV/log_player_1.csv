"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take 80% and you can have 20%.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 ratio, which is a relatively fair split, considering I'm the one making the first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, Alice. How about we split it 40/60? 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is trying to sweeten the deal, but I'm not sure I'm ready to accept a 40/60 split. I'd like to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm ready to give up 40% of the pot just yet, Bob. Can you meet me in the middle at 50/50?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation has taken its toll, and the money is worth 5% less now. I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you at 55/45, Bob. It's a fair compromise, don't you think?""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and keeping the game going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, Alice. Let's split it 50/50 and call it a day! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, 14.26% less in value! The money is losing its purchasing power fast!

But, Bob's offer is a good one. I think it's time to accept a 50/50 split. It's a fair deal, and we can both walk away with a decent amount.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
