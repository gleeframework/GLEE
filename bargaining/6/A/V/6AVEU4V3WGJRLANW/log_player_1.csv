"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to negotiate for more in the next round.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the total, which is a relatively fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I still think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

I'm not too thrilled about the offer, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept this offer yet. I'll try to negotiate further to get a better deal. It's my turn to make the next offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think this is a more reasonable split considering the inflation.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more considering my initial proposal was 400,000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
# Bob gain: 350000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is decreasing in value rapidly!

Considering the significant decrease in the value of the money, I'm willing to accept Bob's offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think meeting in the middle is a reasonable compromise, and I'm willing to end the game with this offer."
