"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money evenly. It's fair and simple. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's tempting to accept an even split, but with inflation looming, it's better to see if Alice will offer more in the next round.  I can always accept a 50/50 split later if I need to!"

Alice's offer is tempting, but it's still less than the 5000 I could get in a 50/50 split.  I'm going to see if I can get a better deal in the next round."

# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Even though Alice's offer is increasing, I'm still hopeful that I can get a better deal in the next round.  I'm not sure how the inflation is affecting Alice, but I'm willing to take a chance and see if we can reach a more equitable agreement."

Inflation is really starting to hurt, and the risk of getting nothing is too high.  While this isn't the ideal split, it's better than getting nothing at all."
