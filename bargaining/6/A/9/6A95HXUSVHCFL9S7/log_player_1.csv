Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fairer. Let's go for 55/45, since you'll get more in the next round if we keep rejecting. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
