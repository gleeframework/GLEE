Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money 60/40.  It's a fair deal that lets us both benefit.

# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see what I can do to get a bigger share!"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think we should split the money 60/40. It's a fair deal that lets us both benefit from this game.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I think this is a good starting point.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want a larger share, but your previous offer wasn't fair considering I moved first. Let's meet in the middle with a 55/45 split. This ensures a larger gain for both of us than dragging it out further. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
It's better to take what I can get than risk getting nothing at all."
