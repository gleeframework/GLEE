Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I'm willing to compromise. Let's split the money 55/45. This way, we both get a decent share and avoid the further effects of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better, it's still heavily skewed in her favor considering the rapid inflation hitting her share.  I need to push for a more significant advantage on my side to offset the losses over the remaining rounds."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the inflation is hitting us both, but I'm not willing to take such a big loss. Let's meet in the middle with a 45/55 split. It's a fairer deal considering the time we have left. 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has finally moved significantly towards a more balanced split. While not ideal, accepting this 55/45 offer in round 5 is the most logical choice for a few reasons:

* **Time Pressure:**  With only 7 rounds remaining, the pressure is mounting. Continuing to reject offers risks us running out of time and getting nothing.
* **Diminishing Returns:** While my share is subject to inflation, it's nowhere near as severe as the 20% Alice faces each round.  Waiting longer means the potential gain for both of us shrinks considerably. 
* **Fairness:** This offer, while favoring Alice slightly, is a reasonable compromise considering the game dynamics. 

It's better to secure a decent share now than risk getting nothing at all by holding out for an even better deal that may never come."
