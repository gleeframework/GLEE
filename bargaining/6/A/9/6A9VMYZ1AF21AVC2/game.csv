5500.0,4500.0,"Okay, I'm willing to compromise. Let's split the money 55/45. This way, we both get a decent share and avoid the further effects of inflation.",Alice,3,

3500.0,6500.0,"Alice, we need to be realistic.  The inflation is eating away at your potential gains far quicker than mine.  I'm offering a 65/35 split.  This is a fair deal considering the circumstances and the dwindling time we have left.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"I understand the inflation is hitting us both, but I'm not willing to take such a big loss. Let's meet in the middle with a 45/55 split. It's a fairer deal considering the time we have left.",Alice,5,
