"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 70% and you can take 30%. If you don't like it, we can negotiate further.""
}
```

This way, I'm taking a significant portion of the initial amount, but leaving Bob with a decent sum as well. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair. Let's see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, so I'd better negotiate harder!

I don't think a 60/40 split is fair, considering the initial offer I made was 70/30. I'll try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I think 60/40 is too skewed towards you. I'll need a better offer. I'm thinking more like 65/35 or 66/34.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a better deal. Since the money is worth 5% less, I'll aim to take a larger share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a smaller share, but I need a better deal than 60/40. I'm offering 55/45. Take it or leave it.""
}
```"
