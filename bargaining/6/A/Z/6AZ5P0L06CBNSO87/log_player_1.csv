"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering you $4,000, and I'll take $6,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","My gain of $6,000 in the first round is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $4,800. 

Bob's gain of $4,000 in the first round is now worth 90% of its original value, which is $3,600.

With the new offer, I'll get $5,000, and you'll get $5,000. Since $5,000 is now worth more than $4,800, I'll accept this offer.
