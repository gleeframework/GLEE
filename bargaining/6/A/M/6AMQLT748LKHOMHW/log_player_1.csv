I'm starting with a very generous offer for Bob.  It's unlikely he'll accept, but it sets the stage for future negotiations.  I want to see if he's willing to play fair or if he'll be greedy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much worse than my initial proposal, and I'm not willing to accept it. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

I'm offering a more balanced split this time, recognizing that Bob likely won't accept my extremely generous offer from the first round.  I'm trying to find a middle ground while still keeping a significant portion of the money for myself."
