# Alice gain: 5800

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm not. Take this before it gets worse 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation. While the offer is getting worse, accepting $4000 now is better than getting $0 later. However, I'm betting Alice will get more desperate in the next round and offer a bit more.  I need to apply more pressure."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Okay, let's stop wasting time. I'll accept your offer from round 1.""}

**Reasoning:**  While I'm holding out for a better deal, the inflation is eating into my potential gains. Accepting a 45/55 split now is better than risking getting nothing if we run out of rounds. This offer puts the pressure back on Alice to either accept a slightly less favorable deal or risk getting nothing at all."
