"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start, then we can negotiate further""
}
```

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 evenly, with each of us getting $5,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game here!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted to split it evenly, but I think I deserve a bit more. This is a good starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants to take a slightly larger share, but I'm not sure if I'm willing to give him that much. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You're asking for a 20% larger share than I initially proposed. I'm not sure I'm willing to give you that much more. Let's try to find a better balance.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 6000 for him and 4000 for me, I'll try to counter with a slightly smaller share for Bob, while keeping my own share the same. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""bob_gain"": 6000,
  ""message"": ""You wanted a bit more, but I'm not willing to give it to you. Let's try to find a middle ground.""
}
```

I'm essentially repeating Bob's offer from Round 2, to see if he'll accept it this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I should get a bit more. This is a fair middle ground. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is still trying to get a slightly larger share. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'm trying to be more cautious with my offers. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You're still trying to take a bit more than I'm willing to give. I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this offer. Let's try to find a better balance.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 5500 for him and 4500 for me, I'll try to counter with a slightly larger share for myself, while keeping Bob's share the same. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4600,
  ""bob_gain"": 5400,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to take a slightly larger share to make up for it. Let's see if this is more acceptable to you.""
}
```"
