"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this fair offer and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slightly more generous offer from me, but still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Thanks for the update on the inflation.

For Round 2, I'll reject Bob's offer. My gain of 3000 is worth 10% less than my initial proposal of 6000, which is a significant decrease. I'd like to try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my offer for Round 3 is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's make a deal!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between my previous offer and Bob's previous offer, while taking into account the decreasing value of money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not getting taken advantage of! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are adding up!

Considering the decreasing value of money, Bob's offer for Round 4 is still a bit too low for me. My gain of 4500 is worth 25% less than my initial proposal of 6000, which is a significant decrease.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 4.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The game continues!

Considering the inflation, my offer for Round 5 is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4800,
  ""bob_gain"": 5200,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and make a deal, Bob!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between my previous offers and Bob's previous offers, while taking into account the increasing effects of inflation."
