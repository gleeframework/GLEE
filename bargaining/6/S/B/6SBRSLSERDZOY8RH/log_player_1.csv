"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose that Alice takes $900,000 and Bob takes $100,000. This leaves a good amount for Bob, and it allows me to start with a strong offer to maximize my potential gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
``` 

I'm going to propose Alice takes $800,000 and Bob takes $200,000. While inflation is a factor, I'm trying to stay aggressive and  secure a larger portion of the money.  I think Bob will be more willing to accept a higher share for him this time, but I still need to secure a significant amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'm unhappy with this offer, I'm aware that inflation is heavily affecting the value of the money. Accepting this will still allow me to gain some profit, whereas rejecting and continuing could lead to both of us getting nothing."
