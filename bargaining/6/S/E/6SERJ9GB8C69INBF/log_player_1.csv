Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's a very generous offer on your part, but I think we can find something a bit more balanced. How about a 60/40 split in my favor?  Think it over carefully, as the pot shrinks with each round! 
# Alice gain: 4000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
