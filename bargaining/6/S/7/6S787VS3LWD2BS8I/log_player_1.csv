Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a fairly generous offer.  I want to secure a good chunk of the money, but I also want to avoid antagonizing Bob and potentially triggering a long negotiation. Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my previous proposal, and the inflation is hurting me.  I'm not going to accept this. Let's see if he's willing to budge."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with a more reasonable split. I've lowered my share slightly, acknowledging the inflation, but I'm still aiming for a majority.  Hopefully, this will be more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to a more even split, the inflation is hitting me hard, and I'm still losing a lot of money compared to my initial proposal.  I'm not going to accept this offer.  I'll keep fighting for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm going to propose an even split this time. Inflation is hitting us both pretty hard now, and I think a 50/50 split is the fairest option at this point. It's a compromise that acknowledges the current situation, and hopefully, Bob will agree to it."
