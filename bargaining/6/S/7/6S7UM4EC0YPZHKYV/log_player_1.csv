"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 70-30, seems fair to me""
}
```

I'm offering to take 70 dollars and leave Bob with 30 dollars. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you in the middle, let's see if you accept 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of 50 dollars is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so it's actually 45 dollars in terms of real value.

I'm willing to accept Bob's offer, since it's a 50-50 split, which is a fair compromise. I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
