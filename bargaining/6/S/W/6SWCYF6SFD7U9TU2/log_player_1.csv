Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want to share fairly, but inflation hurts you more than me.  Let's be fair to both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI rejected Bob's offer. The current offer gives me $4500, which is worth 10% less than in the first round, and Bob gets $5500, which is worth 5% less than in the first round. I will make a counteroffer in the next round.
