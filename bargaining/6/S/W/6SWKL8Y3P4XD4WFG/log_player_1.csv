"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm offering a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or reject this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think for a moment... Since Bob's offer is a 60-40 split, I'm getting a slightly larger share than I initially proposed, but Bob is getting less than he initially proposed. Considering the inflation factor, I think I'll accept this offer. 

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
