Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a better deal for you than last round considering the inflation. Let's close this deal and avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000

{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time here. This offer is a good compromise to account for the inflation we're both facing. Let's settle this now.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm feeling the time crunch too. This is a final offer - it's more than you would have gotten last round, even with the inflation.  Let's wrap this up. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

At this point, the inflation is severely impacting Bob's potential gains. While not ideal, Alice's offer is now better than what Bob offered in Round 4 even with the inflation.  Delaying further significantly risks Bob's position."
