I'm proposing to keep 90% of the money, and give Bob the remaining 10%.  Since this is the first round, it's a relatively generous offer. I figure it's a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 360000 
# Bob gain: 640000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I reject Bob's offer. While I am losing money with each passing round, I believe I can still get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the money, which is still a significant amount. I believe this is a fair offer considering the inflation and the fact that I'm taking a slight decrease from my initial offer."
