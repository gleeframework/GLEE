"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 650000,
""bob_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable and end this quickly. This offer benefits us both.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Initial Offer:**  Starting with a 65/35 split in Alice's favor is strong but not offensively greedy. It gives Bob a decent amount while still acknowledging Alice's advantage in the early rounds. 
* **Time Pressure:** The message emphasizes a quick resolution. This reminds Bob that delays hurt both players due to inflation, but especially Alice. The longer the game goes, the less appealing any offer becomes.
* **Future Leverage:**  While this offer seems generous, it sets a tone for future rounds. If Bob declines, Alice's next offer will likely be less favorable, highlighting the real cost of each refusal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but let's find a more balanced solution. How about this? 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is a significant swing in his favor. While inflation is a factor, accepting this deal would mean a massive loss for Alice compared to her initial offer.  It's clear Bob is trying to exploit the inflation mechanic to his advantage.  Alice needs to hold firm and demonstrate that she won't be bullied into a bad deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Bob, I'm aiming for a fair resolution. This offer still gives you a good share, and it accounts for the time pressure we're both under.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  Alice is lowering her initial demand, but not drastically. This shows a willingness to negotiate while making it clear she won't be lowballed. 
* **Inflation Factor:** A 55/45 split in this round is roughly equivalent in value to Alice's previous 65/35 offer due to inflation.  She's maintaining her position in real terms.
* **Time Pressure Reminder:**  The message again highlights the shared risk of inflation, subtly reminding Bob that dragging out the negotiation hurts him as well.
* **""Fairness"" Framing:** By emphasizing ""fairness,"" Alice subtly challenges Bob's previous offer, implying it was unreasonable and potentially jeopardizing a quick agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is a fair offer considering the time pressure and the fact that the value decreases significantly for you with each round. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Unacceptable Shift:** Bob is trying to flip the script and present a slightly worse offer than his last one as ""fair."" This is a clear attempt to exploit the situation and the increasing pressure on Alice. 
* **Knowing Her Value:** Alice's starting offer reflected her understanding of the game's dynamics. Accepting a deal where she gets less than half, even after considerable inflation, significantly undervalues her position.
* **Calculated Risk:** While time is working against Alice, she needs to show resolve. Accepting this offer sets a dangerous precedent and signals to Bob that she's willing to take a bad deal under pressure. There's a good chance Bob will make a more reasonable offer in the next round rather than risk the entire deal falling apart."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest option.  We're both losing out the longer this goes on.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Stand:** By round 5, the inflation has significantly eroded potential gains for both players.  A 50/50 split, while not ideal for Alice at this point, prevents further losses and sends a clear message.
* **Emphasis on Shared Loss:** The message directly highlights that both players are suffering from the stalled negotiations. This reinforces the urgency and discourages Bob from further brinkmanship.
* **Fairness as a Resolution Tactic:**  While Alice has been aiming for a slightly favorable deal, offering an even split now frames the decision as a matter of pure pragmatism. It removes the incentive for Bob to counter-offer with anything less, as that would be illogical given the declining value. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's a risk Bob will reject this and try to push for an even better deal in the next round.  However, Alice is betting that Bob will recognize the diminishing returns and opt for a sure thing rather than risking everything collapsing."
