"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need for further negotiations!""
}
```

I'm starting with a fair and simple offer, hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I deserve a slightly larger share for taking the risk of rejecting your offer. Let's go with a 60/40 split. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not a bad offer, but I'm not willing to give up that much. I'll try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a bit too skewed towards you. I'll need a better deal to consider it.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and the fact that Bob's offer was a bit too generous for him, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""You're taking a risk by rejecting my first offer, so I'm adjusting the odds slightly in my favor. This is my best offer.""
}
```"
