Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I'm willing to meet closer to the middle, but I need a slightly better deal to account for the loss in value. 
# Alice gain: 5080 
# Bob gain: 4920 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is exaggerating the impact of inflation.  While it's true his potential gains are decreasing, my potential gains remain the same. I'm willing to negotiate, but he needs to be more realistic.  I'll hold out for a slightly better offer."

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the substantial impact of inflation, I believe an equal split is now a fair compromise. Let's meet in the middle to account for the loss in value on my end. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer a slightly larger share, accepting an even split now guarantees a reasonable outcome.  The longer this drags on, the more pressure there is to accept a less favorable deal as we approach the 12-round limit.  It's better to secure a sure thing now than risk getting nothing."
