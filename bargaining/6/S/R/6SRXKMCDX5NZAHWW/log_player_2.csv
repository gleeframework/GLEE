"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that still gives Alice a slight advantage but is more favorable to me than the original offer. Since the money is worth 5% less to me with each passing round, I'll try to be strategic about the negotiations.\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 4900, ""alice_gain"": 5100, ""message"": ""Let's meet closer to the middle, considering the impact of inflation on my end.""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the inflation affects you, but I'm willing to meet closer to the middle. This is a fair offer. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer. Considering the inflation, Alice's new offer doesn't significantly improve my position compared to the original offer. With 10 rounds remaining, I'm willing to take the risk of further inflation to potentially negotiate a more favorable deal. The current offer still gives Alice a noticeable advantage, and I believe there's room for improvement. Let's proceed to the next round!"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make another offer, taking into account the inflation and Alice's previous offer. Since the money is worth 9.75% less to me now, I'll try to find a balance that is closer to the middle but still acknowledges Alice's advantage.\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 4920, ""alice_gain"": 5080, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to meet closer to the middle, but I need a slightly better deal to account for the loss in value.""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable. I'm adjusting my offer again to find a compromise. This is a fair deal considering the time pressure and inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4850 
# Alice gain: 5150 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer. Although Alice has made a slight adjustment, the offer still doesn't fully account for the increasing impact of inflation on my end. With 8 rounds remaining, I'm willing to continue negotiating to find a more favorable deal. The current offer still gives Alice a noticeable advantage, and I believe there's room for improvement. Let's proceed to the next round!"
