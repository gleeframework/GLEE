"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10} 
```

I'm starting with a relatively fair offer, keeping in mind that I have to account for inflation. I want to ensure a positive outcome for myself while also giving Bob a reasonable share, hopefully encouraging him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is still fair considering the inflation, and I don't want to risk getting nothing if we reach the 12th round."
