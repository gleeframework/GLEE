"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better.  Let's split it 60/40, with me taking 600000 this time. We can continue negotiating, but inflation will only hurt us both. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
