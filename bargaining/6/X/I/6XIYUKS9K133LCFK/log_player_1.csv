"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take the lower amount to set the tone for the game""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split, where I'll take $8,000 and Bob will take $2,000. I'm hoping this will set a reasonable tone for the game and give Bob an incentive to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, as I'm taking the risk of rejecting your offer. Let's see what you think. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Since I've already lost 10% of my potential gain due to inflation, I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal. However, I'm not sure if I want to reject the offer and risk losing another 10% of the remaining amount.

I'll accept this offer for now.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
