"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a proposal that favors me slightly. I'm hoping Bob will see that it's a reasonable offer and accept it, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though I'm losing more value with each round, I'm still getting a decent amount of money.  It's better to take the 70 now than risk getting nothing if we keep going."
