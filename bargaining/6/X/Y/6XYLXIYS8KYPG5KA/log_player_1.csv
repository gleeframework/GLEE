"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, but I'm leaving room for negotiation. Let's see what Bob has to say!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, given I'm taking on the risk of inflation in the next round. Let's see if you agree! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of 40 is now worth 36 in the new round (since 10% less than 40).

I'm not convinced that I should take on the risk of inflation in the next round, so I'll reject Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Given that the money is now worth 90% of its original value due to inflation, my offer for Round 3 is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob! Let's make a deal!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise that's fair, considering the inflation effect."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still think a 55/45 split is a fair reflection of the risks we're both taking. Let's end this now and avoid further inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of 45 is now worth 32.7 in the new round (since 27.1% less than 45).

I'm not sure if I'm willing to accept a 45-55 split, considering I was initially looking for a more favorable split. I'll reject Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now due to inflation. Considering the current value, my offer for Round 5 is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's call it a draw, Bob. I'll meet you exactly in the middle this time!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a more balanced split, considering the diminishing value of the money."
