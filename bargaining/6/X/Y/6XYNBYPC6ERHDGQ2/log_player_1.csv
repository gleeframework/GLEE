"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where I'll get $5,000 and Bob will get $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering I'll be taking the risk of proposing. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60/40, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's closer to a 50/50 split. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fairer split than 60/40.""}

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
