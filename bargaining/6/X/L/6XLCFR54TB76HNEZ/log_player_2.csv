Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm willing to give you another chance 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing a tough game, but she's starting to budge.  It's clear she understands I'm serious about not accepting a bad deal. While the time pressure is on, accepting now would still mean losing a significant amount to inflation. I need to hold out for a slightly better offer."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 480000,
""alice_gain"": 520000,
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the slight concession. I'm willing to meet you halfway to end this. This is my final offer.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Time is running out, and the inflation is eating into potential gains.  I need to signal I'm willing to compromise but still get a reasonable deal. By bumping up my share slightly and making it clear this is my last offer, I put the pressure on Alice to accept before we both lose out."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take a bit more, considering the inflation is really hurting your share 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough one, but the clock is ticking. Alice is clearly trying to squeeze me, knowing the inflation is hurting. While this offer isn't ideal, it's better to accept something rather than risk getting nothing in the end.  The difference in gains is getting smaller, and I need to cut my losses before the inflation eats up even more of my potential share."
