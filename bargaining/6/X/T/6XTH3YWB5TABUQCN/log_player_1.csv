Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

This offer is a little greedy on my part, Alice, but I want to see how Bob reacts. If he's reasonable, we can work out a more even split later in the game.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is extremely unfair!  I'll take my chances and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40} 
```

I'm offering a more even split this time, Bob.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement before the value of our money drops even further!"
