"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I get most, but you still get a decent share. Accept, and we're done. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While it's tempting to take the 100,000, it's better to see what Alice will offer in the next round. We have 12 rounds, and the money will be worth less with each passing round.  I can try to negotiate a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Let's split it evenly. We both get a fair share, and we can avoid the risk of losing money with inflation.""
