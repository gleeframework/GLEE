{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we each get $5,000."

# Bob's message: A slight advantage, but I'm willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

I'm not thrilled about the 20% advantage Bob is taking, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept the offer for now.
