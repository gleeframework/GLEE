"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and give Bob $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","My offer from the previous round was worth $6,000 to me, and now the money is worth 20% less, so that's $4,800. Bob's offer is worth $4,500 to me, which is 10% less than $5,000. I'll accept Bob's offer.
