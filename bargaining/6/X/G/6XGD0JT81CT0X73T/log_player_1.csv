Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going for a fairly aggressive offer in the first round. I'm aiming for a large portion of the money, but I'm also leaving Bob with something to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, considering the inflation (my offer is worth less) and Bob's counter-offer, it's in my best interest to accept this offer."
