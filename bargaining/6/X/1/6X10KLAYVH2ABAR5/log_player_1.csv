"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further""
}
```

This is a straightforward offer, splitting the $1,000,000 equally between us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 400k, it's a good starting point. Your turn to negotiate! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the $400,000 I'd gain is now worth 95% of its original value, which is $380,000.

I'd rather not accept an offer that leaves me with less than half of the original amount. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Too low, I want a higher share""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll aim for a higher share. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a slightly larger share, but I'm willing to compromise""
}
```

This offer takes into account the 5% devaluation of the money due to inflation, and I'm aiming for a slightly higher share to compensate for it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much. Your turn to think! 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the $480,000 I'd gain is now worth 85.74% of its original value, which is approximately $411,552.

I'd rather not accept an offer that leaves me with less than 50% of the original amount. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Still a bit too low, I want a higher share""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5

  ""bob_gain"": 475000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting closer to my target, meet me in the middle""
}
```

This offer takes into account the cumulative effect of inflation, and I'm aiming for a slightly higher share to compensate for it."
