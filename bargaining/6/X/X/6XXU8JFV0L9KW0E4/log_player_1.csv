"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly, I'll take 60%""}\n\n###\n\nI'll offer Bob 40% of the money, which is a relatively fair and generous offer, considering I'm the one making the first proposal. This way, Bob might be more inclined to accept, and we can both walk away with a good amount of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your turn to be impressed. I'm feeling generous, but the clock is ticking. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nBob's offer isn't bad, but considering I offered him 40% in the first round and he rejected it, I think I can try to get a better deal. The fact that the money is worth 20% less now also makes his offer less appealing. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""I'll meet you halfway from my first offer. Time is running out!""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the money is now worth 20% less than the original amount, and taking into account Bob's previous offer, I'll try to find a middle ground. I'll decrease my initial offer by 20,000, hoping that Bob will see this as a compromise and accept it before the money loses even more value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my last offer before the money shrinks even more. Don't get greedy! 
# Alice gain: 490000 
# Bob gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the money has lost almost half of its value and Bob's offer is relatively close to an equal split, I think it's time to accept. If I reject and the game continues, the money will lose even more value, and I might end up with less than what Bob is offering now. It's better to secure this amount rather than risking further loss due to inflation."
