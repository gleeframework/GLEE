```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'm willing to give you a small share. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'm not willing to accept a 30-70 split, especially since the money is worth less with each passing round. I'd like to negotiate further!"

  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. What do you say, Bob?""

# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the money is worth less and less with each round! I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'll have to think carefully...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 20-80 split, especially since I'm not even getting a ""token of appreciation"" that I can use to negotiate further. I'll try to do better next time."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 21.3% of its original value now, I'll have to be more aggressive in my proposal. Here's my new offer:

# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth less and less with each round, and Bob's offers are getting more and more unfavorable. I'm not willing to accept a 10-90 split, especially when the money is worth only 20.5% of its original value now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll have to think of a new strategy to get a better deal. Maybe I can try to negotiate a higher share or propose a different split. The game is getting intense!"

# Alice gain: 500 
# Bob gain: 9500 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth a mere 9.53% of its original value now, and Bob's offers are getting more and more insulting. I'm not willing to accept a 5-95 split, especially when I'm getting a paltry sum.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll have to think of a new strategy to get a better deal. Maybe I can try to propose a different type of split, like a ratio of the remaining value rather than a fixed amount. The game is getting intense, and I'm running out of time!"

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth a mere 5.79% of its original value now, I'll have to be extremely aggressive in my proposal. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not going to give up yet! I'll have to think of a new strategy, but I'm running out of time and options. I need to come up with something clever to salvage what's left of the deal."

Round 11
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth a mere 2.37% of its original value now, I'll have to be extremely aggressive and creative in my proposal. Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 1,
  ""bob_gain"": 9999,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to take the minimum, Bob. You can have the rest. I'm done.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 1-99 split, taking the smallest possible share of the remaining value. I'm not getting any younger, and I'm not going to give up without a fight, but I'm also not going to get desperate enough to accept a laughable offer. This is my last stand."

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the $1, but I'm not going to let Bob think he's won. I'll just smile sweetly and take my tiny share. Game over."
