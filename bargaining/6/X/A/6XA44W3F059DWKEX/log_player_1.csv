"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and let's split the cash!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping he'll accept quickly and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Accept this reasonable offer and let's end the game! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer for Round 2 is:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll wait for a better deal, the money is still worth a lot to me!""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than a 60/40 split. I'll wait for his next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob! I'm not getting any younger!""
}
```

I'm trying to negotiate a slightly better deal for myself, while still leaving Bob with a decent share. Let's see if he'll bite!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle, Alice. Fair is fair! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer for Round 4 is a 50/50 split, which is a more reasonable proposal. However, considering the inflation, the value of the money is decreasing, and I'd rather have a slightly larger share now. Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I want to split it down the middle, Bob. I'll wait for a better offer.""
}
```

I'm rejecting the 50/50 split, hoping that Bob will make another offer that gives me a slightly better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""Last chance, Bob! Take it or leave it, but I'm not going any higher!""
}
```

I'm trying to squeeze a bit more out of the deal, hoping that Bob will accept before the next round of inflation hits."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going any lower, Alice. Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer for Round 6 is a 60/40 split in his favor, which is a significant shift in his favor due to the effects of inflation. Considering the decreasing value of the money, I'd rather take a smaller share now than risk waiting for another round and potentially getting an even smaller share. Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Fine, Bob. You got a good deal. I'll accept your offer.""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer, and we can finally end the game."
