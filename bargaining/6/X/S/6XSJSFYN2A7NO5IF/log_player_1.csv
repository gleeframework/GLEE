"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, I'll take the majority""}

I'm proposing that I take 80% of the initial $10,000, which is $8,000, and Bob takes the remaining 20%, which is $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55:45 split is fair, given the inflation we're facing. Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with the 55:45 split, as it's still heavily biased towards Bob. I was hoping for a more balanced split considering the inflation. I'll reject this offer and wait for Bob's next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3

I'm proposing that I take 60% of the remaining $10,000, which is $6,000, and Bob takes the remaining 40%, which is $4,000."
