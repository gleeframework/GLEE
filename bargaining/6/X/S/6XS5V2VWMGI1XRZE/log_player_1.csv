"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

This is a fair starting point.  I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, hoping to build a bit of goodwill and secure his acceptance.  Let's see how this goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a fair offer considering the inflation. While I would have preferred to take more, it's better to get something than nothing."
