"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This way, I get the majority of the money, but Bob still gets a decent amount. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for Bob, he's offering me $4,500 (5000 * 0.9) and keeping $4,500 for himself.

I'll accept this offer, as it's a 50-50 split and I'll get a decent amount of money.
