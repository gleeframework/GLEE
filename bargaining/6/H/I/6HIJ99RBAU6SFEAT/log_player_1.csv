"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

I propose taking 999,000 for myself and giving Bob 1,000.  This leaves a lot of money on the table for Bob, which I hope will convince him to accept the offer in this first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 750000 
# Bob gain: 250000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer.  While it's a significant amount of money, I'm still confident I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000} 
```

I'm going to reduce my offer slightly to 900,000 for myself, but I'm still giving Bob a generous share of 100,000.  This should be attractive to him, given the inflation affecting the money he receives."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 625000 
# Bob gain: 375000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. Even with the inflation impacting Bob's gains, I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000} 
```

I'm further reducing my offer to 800,000 for myself.  This is still a generous amount for Bob, considering the inflation and the fact that the money is getting worth less for him with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 562500 
# Bob gain: 437500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to a 50/50 split, I still believe I can secure a larger share of the money.  The inflation is hitting Bob harder than me, and I'm confident I can leverage this to my advantage in the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer again to 700,000 for myself.  Bob is losing a significant amount of value with each passing round due to inflation, so I'm hoping this offer will be more attractive to him than his previous proposals."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even though Bob is offering an even split, I believe I can still do better. The inflation is significantly impacting his gains, and I'm confident I can convince him to accept a slightly lower offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000} 
```

I'm offering 650,000 for myself, and 350,000 for Bob.  This is a significant reduction for Bob, but it's still a better offer than the 50/50 split he offered in the previous round, and we're running out of time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 375000 
# Bob gain: 625000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. While the money Bob is gaining is worth much less due to inflation, I'm confident that with only a few rounds remaining, I can secure a better deal.  His offer is getting too close to a 50/50 split, and I'm willing to risk it to potentially get more."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000} 
```

With only two rounds remaining, I'm taking a risk and proposing a split of 600,000 for myself and 400,000 for Bob.  The inflation is heavily impacting his gains, and I'm hoping this will be enough to entice him to accept before we both end up with nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I accept this offer.  It's not the ideal outcome, but with only one round remaining, and the money worth significantly less for Bob, I'm taking what I can get.  It's better than ending up with nothing."
