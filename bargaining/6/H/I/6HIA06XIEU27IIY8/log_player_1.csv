Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, Alice, but the split isn't quite fair considering the inflation. How about we try a 55/45 split in your favor? 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Bob, my offer is still fair considering the inflation. We are both losing money by dragging this out.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the only fair option here.  We both lose with each passing round. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
``` 
 
While not the best outcome, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is better than risking further rounds. The inflation is eating into both your shares, and Bob is unlikely to offer anything better in future rounds.  A sure 50% is better than risking getting nothing."
