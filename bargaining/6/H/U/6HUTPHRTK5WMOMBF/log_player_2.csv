"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. It's a fair start. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While a 50/50 split seems fair on the surface, inflation hurts Bob more than Alice. By rejecting this offer, Bob signals that he's aware of the inflation dynamic and pushes for a better deal in later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I appreciate the even split offer, Alice, but the inflation hurts me more. How about a slightly better share for me this time?""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Taking Initiative:**  By making the first counter-offer, Bob sets a new starting point for the negotiation. 
* **Addressing the Inflation:** The message directly mentions the inflation disparity, making Alice aware that it's a key factor in Bob's decision-making.
* **Reasonable Demand:**  A 60/40 split in Bob's favor is a significant change from the 50/50 offer but not drastically unfair. It gives Alice room to negotiate while still reflecting the urgency of the inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand inflation affects us both, Bob. Let's compromise. I'll increase my share slightly, but I need a fair deal as well. 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is acknowledging the inflation but still pushing for a deal that benefits her in the long run. While 55/45 is better than her initial offer, it's still not favorable enough for Bob considering the rapid devaluation of the money.  Each round Bob delays accepting, he loses a significant chunk of potential value. It's time to push back a bit harder to show Alice he's serious about getting a deal that reflects the inflation disadvantage."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6500, ""alice_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""Alice, we need to find a solution quickly, the clock is ticking and the money is literally evaporating. I'm proposing a 65/35 split. This reflects the urgency of the situation for me.""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Increased Urgency:**  The message highlights the time pressure and the shrinking pot. 
* **Stronger Stance:**  The 65/35 split is a firm counter-offer, moving closer to Bob's desired outcome. 
* **Justification:**  Bob reiterates that his offer is a direct response to the inflation disadvantage he faces. 
 
This offer creates a more serious tone and emphasizes the need for a quick resolution in Bob's favor."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time. I'm willing to give you a larger share to avoid the risk of getting nothing. Let's agree on this and move forward. 
# Bob gain: 6000 
# Alice gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, Alice's offer is now the same as Bob's round 2 offer. Given the rapid inflation and the shrinking number of rounds remaining, accepting this offer is the best way to secure a reasonable amount. Waiting any longer significantly risks getting nothing at all."
