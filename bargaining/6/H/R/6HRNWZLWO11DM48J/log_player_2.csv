Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 4

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You should take this, the money is losing value fast for you 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, accepting is the most logical choice for Bob. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:** The value of the money is steadily decreasing for Bob due to inflation.  Waiting any longer will only result in a worse deal for him.
* **Alice's Position:** Alice knows time is on her side and is unlikely to offer anything significantly better. Accepting a 4200 split now is better than risking even less in future rounds. 
* **Uncertainty:** There's no guarantee Alice won't propose an even worse deal in the next round. Taking the current offer avoids that risk. 

While not ideal, accepting the current offer cuts Bob's losses and ends the game."
