# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but still a fair split 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'm not as keen on accepting a smaller share.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'd rather negotiate further to get a better deal."

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I need a bit more for myself""
}

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm keeping a bit more for myself. Let's see if he accepts this offer!"

# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, but still willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is eating away at the value of the money, and I need to be more careful with my decision.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I need a decent share for myself""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share than before, but I'm still trying to get a decent amount for myself. Let's see if he accepts this offer!"
