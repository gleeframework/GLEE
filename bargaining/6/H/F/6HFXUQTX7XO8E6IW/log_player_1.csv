"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm starting with a straightforward proposal, suggesting a 50/50 split. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take a small share, I'm the one making the first offer! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to take a bigger share, huh?

I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give up 60% of the money just yet. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round!"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer that's a bit more aggressive.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""You took a big share last time, now it's my turn!""
}
```

I'm taking a slightly larger share this time, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount. Let's see if he's willing to accept!"

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You took a big share last time, now it's my turn to take a big share! 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob's offer is quite aggressive this time!

Considering the inflation, Bob's share is actually worth significantly less than in the first round. I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give up 90% of the money, even if it's worth less due to inflation. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to find a middle ground.

I'm offering a 55/45 split, which is closer to my previous offer. Let's see if Bob is willing to compromise!"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're running out of time, Alice, don't be greedy! 
# Alice gain: 2 
# Bob gain: 98 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob's offer is getting more and more extreme!

Considering the inflation, Bob's share is worth an incredibly small amount, but I'm not sure if it's worth it to me.

However, I'm starting to get worried about running out of time... I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give up 98% of the money, even if it's worth very little due to inflation. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round!"

  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""Last chance, Bob, let's end this fairly!""
}
```

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're almost out of time, Alice, I'm not budging! 
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","This is getting ridiculous! Bob's offer is almost laughable at this point.

Considering the inflation, Bob's share is worth an incredibly small amount, but I'm not sure if it's worth it to me.

However, I'm running out of time, and I don't want to leave with nothing. I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer, even though it's not ideal. At least I'll get something out of it."
