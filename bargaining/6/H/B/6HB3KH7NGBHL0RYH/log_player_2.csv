Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems we both have similar ideas about what's fair but haven't quite found the middle ground. Time is ticking, and this money is literally evaporating. Let's make it a clean 50/50 split and call it a day. A fair deal for both of us, wouldn't you agree? 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
