"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to get the negotiations started!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start the game, hoping to set a fair and reasonable tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent amount, but I think I deserve more for taking the risk of making the first offer! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 5% less, so the effective amounts are:

* Alice gain: 4000
* Bob gain: 5700

Considering Bob's message and the numbers, I think I can do better. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the value of the money decreasing due to inflation, my offer for Round 3 is:

  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more for being flexible.""
}
```

I'm increasing my share by 200, trying to find a middle ground that Bob might accept."

Round 4

# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. Considering the offer from Bob, I think I can do better than 3000. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.
