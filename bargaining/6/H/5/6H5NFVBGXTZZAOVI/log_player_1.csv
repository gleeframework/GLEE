Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60/40 split in my favor, considering the risk of inflation. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges both our needs. 
# Alice gain: 40
