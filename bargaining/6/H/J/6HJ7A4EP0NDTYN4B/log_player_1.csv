"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly, I'm willing to compromise.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself, which is a 60-40 split. This is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, no need to be too greedy 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $5,000 is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, which is $4,500.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not sure if I should accept it. I'd be getting $4,500, which is less than my initial offer of $6,000. But on the other hand, it's a 50/50 split, and I don't want to risk going to the next round and facing even more inflation.

I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```"
