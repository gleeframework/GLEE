Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more since you're losing value with each round 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're losing value fast, I think it's time I take the bigger share 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While the value is decreasing, I'm not in a desperate position yet. Accepting $4000 is a significant loss compared to the initial rounds. It's better to negotiate further and see if Bob is willing to be fairer, even with the inflation working against me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's stop wasting time. The inflation is hurting me, but I'm willing to split it evenly. It's our best shot at a fair deal.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

It's time to get realistic.  

* **Inflation Impact:**  The inflation is steadily eroding my potential gains. While I started ambitiously, waiting longer significantly hurts me.
* **Bob's Stance:** Bob seems unwilling to budge from the 60/40 split in his favor. He's likely banking on me panicking as the inflation worsens.
* **50/50 Offer:** A 50/50 split, even with inflation, is better than accepting a worse deal later or risking getting nothing at all if the game goes on too long."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is really eating into your share, I'm willing to take more to end this 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

It's painful, but I have to be pragmatic.

* **Severe Inflation:** The inflation has reached a critical point. Rejecting this offer means risking even less in the next round.
* **Bob's Unlikely Shift:** Bob knows I'm desperate. He's unlikely to offer anything better than this, and may even go lower in future rounds.
* **Something is Better Than Nothing:** Accepting a low offer is better than letting the game continue and potentially ending up with nothing."
