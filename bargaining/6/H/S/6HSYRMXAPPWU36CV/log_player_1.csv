"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60, you take 40. No need to negotiate further.""
}
```

This is a relatively even split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it to end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fairer. It's closer to even, and I'm willing to give up a bit more to avoid further negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, I'll have to be more cautious. With the new offer, I'd be getting $45, which is 45% of the original $100. That's a decent offer, but I'm not sure if I want to settle for it.

I'll reject the offer and make a counteroffer. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure about the 55/45 split. I'll make a counteroffer: 50/50. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll aim to get a slightly higher share to compensate for the reduced value. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 52,
  ""bob_gain"": 48,
  ""message"": ""I'll take 52, you take 48. It's a slight lean towards me, but I'm willing to compromise.""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed."
