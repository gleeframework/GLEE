"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair! I propose we split the money 60/40, with me taking the larger share since I'm making the first offer. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer, hoping to get a better deal. Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Alice in each subsequent round, I'm willing to take the risk and see if I can negotiate a more favorable split.\n\nPlease let me know when it's my turn to make an offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think 55/45 is a more reasonable split.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable. Inflation is affecting both of us, so a 50/50 split seems like the fairest option.  We can avoid further losses this way. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll accept the offer since it's a 50/50 split, and considering the inflation, it's better to secure the deal now rather than risking further losses. Given that the money is worth 9.75% less for me and 36% less for Alice compared to the first round, I believe this is a reasonable compromise.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nLet's finalize the deal!"
