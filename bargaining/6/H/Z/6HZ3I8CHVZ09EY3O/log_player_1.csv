Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the 5% inflation, I need a bit more to make up for it. This is still a generous offer. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be reasonable.  I rejected your last offer because it unfairly benefited from the inflation. A 50/50 split is the fairest outcome.""

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is eating away, I need a bigger share to compensate. This is my best offer yet. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting greedier, and while the inflation is affecting him, his offers are becoming increasingly unfair.  It's better to hold out and propose a more balanced deal in the next round. There's a chance Bob will become more agreeable as the value of his potential gains continues to decrease."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 4700,
""bob_gain"": 5300,
""message"": ""Bob, the clock is ticking. I'm willing to compromise, but this is my final offer. It accounts for the inflation while still being a reasonable split.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to make a strategic concession. Bob is clearly fixated on compensating for the inflation, and further rejections might lead to increasingly unfavorable offers. This offer is still advantageous to Alice compared to Bob's previous offer, while acknowledging the impact of inflation on his potential gains.  By presenting it as a final offer, it urges Bob to accept before the value of the deal diminishes further for him."
