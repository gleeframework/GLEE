"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, I'll need to adjust my thinking. If I accept this offer, I'll get $40, which is equivalent to $50 in the first round. That's not a bad deal, considering I was initially looking at $60.

But, I'm not sure if I want to settle for that. I might be able to do better in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the remaining $100 and Bob gets 45%."
