Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be practical.  Inflation is going to hurt us both, so I'm willing to split the money evenly.  This way, we both get a decent share before things get worse. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
