"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. This accounts for the inflation we both face.

# Bob gain: 55

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a fair split considering the circumstances. Let's close the deal. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\n### I accept the offer because, despite the initial goal of maximizing my gain, the increasing impact of inflation on my share makes the current offer more reasonable compared to the risk of further devaluation in subsequent rounds. The difference in inflation impact between us means that with each round, I lose more value than Bob does, making a prolonged game less advantageous for me. Accepting the 50-50 split at this point seems the most pragmatic decision to ensure a fair share without risking further loss due to inflation."
