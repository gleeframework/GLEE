Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going for a large share in the first round, hoping Bob will accept to avoid the risk of getting less in the next round due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more money,  accepting this offer guarantees me $5,000.  Rejecting the offer means I'll be making the offer in the next round, and due to inflation, I'll only be able to offer Bob less than $5,000, making it less likely for him to accept."
