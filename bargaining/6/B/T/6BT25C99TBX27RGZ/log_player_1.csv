"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept and we can split the money quickly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, and I'll take $900,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer to avoid going into further rounds and risking inflation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle. Fair is fair, and we both get a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, I'm now looking at a gain of $720,000 (80% of $900,000).

I don't think splitting it down the middle is a bad idea, but I'd like to try to get a bit more. However, I'm not sure if I can do better than this offer.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now.
