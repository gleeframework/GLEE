"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $100, and leaving Bob with 40%. This seems like a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of 50$ is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, which is 0.95 * 50 = 47.5$.

I'm not sure if Bob's gain of 50$ is worth more or less than mine, but since the offer is 50/50, I'm willing to accept it.
