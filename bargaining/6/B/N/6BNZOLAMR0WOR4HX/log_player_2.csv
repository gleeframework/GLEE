"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair share, let's be friends! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer seems fair on the surface, the impact of inflation is significant.  Here's why I'm rejecting:

* **Time is Money:**  Each round that passes eats into the value of the money. Delaying benefits me more than Alice because her depreciation rate is higher.
* **Aiming Higher:** My goal is to maximize my gains. While I might not get a 55/45 split in my favor, I can aim for a more advantageous distribution by leveraging the inflation factor."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Let's be realistic, Alice. Time is literally money in this game, and it's depreciating faster for you. Take this offer while it's still good!""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Understandable:** This offer heavily favors me, but it's presented with the reasoning that Alice should prioritize a smaller but guaranteed gain now over a potentially larger gain later (which might never come). 
* **Leveraging Inflation:** I'm banking on Alice understanding that each round of rejection costs her more than it costs me. This pressure might incentivize her to accept a less favorable deal now."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You may think time is on your side, but I'm not desperate yet! 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to call my bluff, but her offer is actually worse than her first one considering the inflation. Here's why I'm holding firm:

* **Inflation Advantage:** While the shrinking pot hurts, it's hurting Alice more.  Every round that passes makes her more likely to accept a deal favorable to me.
* **Testing Her Resolve:**  I need to see if Alice is willing to budge significantly. If she keeps offering splits close to 50/50, I might have to adjust my strategy in later rounds. But for now, I'm maintaining pressure."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5800,
""alice_gain"": 4200,
""message"": ""Okay, Alice, let's be reasonable. I've adjusted my offer to reflect the time pressure, but this is as low as I'm willing to go.  Don't let pride cost you a decent share!""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  I'm showing a willingness to negotiate by slightly reducing my initial demand.  This makes me appear more reasonable and might make Alice more receptive.
* **Shifting the Blame:**  By framing it as ""pride"" potentially costing her, I'm putting the onus on her to accept a less favorable deal. 
* **Deadline Pressure:** We're getting closer to the halfway point.  While I'm willing to let a few more rounds pass, I need to start applying more pressure soon."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Pride has nothing to do with it, I'm just not intimidated. Yet. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

It's time to cut my losses and take the deal. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:** While not ideal, this offer is better than her previous one, even considering the inflation. Holding out for a much better deal is becoming increasingly risky. 
* **Alice is Playing Tough:** It's clear Alice is willing to let the rounds pass, even if it means the pot shrinks. Her resolve seems stronger than initially anticipated.
* **Mid-Game Strategy:** We're past the halfway point. While I'm confident I could outwait Alice, there's a risk she'll become desperate towards the end and offer me a pittance, hoping I'll panic and accept anything. It's better to secure a decent sum now."
