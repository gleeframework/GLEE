  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80/20, I'll take the bigger share, but it's a fair starting point""

# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

  ""message"": ""I'll give you 60% now, but I think I deserve more""

  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take the lion's share, it's the only way I can afford to keep up with inflation""

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer because, at this point, I'm not sure if I can do better. The 91/9 split is still quite favorable to me, and I'm willing to take it to avoid further negotiation."
