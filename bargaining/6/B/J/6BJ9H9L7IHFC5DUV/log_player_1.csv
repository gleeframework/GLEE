"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering Bob $40, and I'll take the remaining $60. This seems like a fair split, but I'm willing to negotiate if Bob wants to make a counteroffer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation, the effective value of my gain is now 48 (60 - 20% of 60 = 0.8 * 60 = 48). 

Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, which is a good compromise. I'll accept this offer.
