"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. Let's start with a fair split, but I'll need most of the money to get things going. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer was quite generous, but I believe my contributions deserve a more significant share. Let's be reasonable and split the money 60/40.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire for a bigger share, but I'm not comfortable with your last offer. Let's compromise â€“ 70/30 is a fair split, considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer a larger share, Alice's offer is now reasonable considering the inflation. 

* **My perspective:** Accepting 300,000$ now is better than risking further devaluation of the money in subsequent rounds.  
* **Alice's perspective:** Her offer acknowledges my desire for a larger share while still securing a significant portion for herself. 

Waiting longer could lead to a worse outcome for both of us due to the rapidly decreasing value of the money."
