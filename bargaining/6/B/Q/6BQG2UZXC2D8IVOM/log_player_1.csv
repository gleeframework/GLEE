I'm going for a big chunk of the money, hoping Bob will be happy with a smaller share and accept the offer in the first round.  Let's see how this goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer.  Even though the offer is better than what I proposed in the first round, I think I can get more if I wait. Bob's offer is still too low, and I'm confident I can get a bigger piece of the pie.  Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9500, ""bob_gain"": 500}
```

I'm going to try and push my luck again, but this time I'm going to offer Bob a slightly higher amount. I'm hoping that by showing some flexibility I can get him to accept the offer, as the inflation is starting to creep in."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7500 
# Bob gain: 2500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still going to reject this offer.  While the inflation is starting to affect Bob's share, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'm going to wait and see if he gets more desperate in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9750, ""bob_gain"": 250}
```

I'm going to make one more attempt at a high offer, hoping Bob will finally accept. This time, I'm offering a bit less than my previous offer, but still a significant amount. With the inflation starting to hit harder, Bob may be more inclined to take what he can get."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting better, but I'm still holding out for more. The inflation is starting to really hit him hard, and I think I can get a bigger share if I wait just a little longer.  I'm going to see if I can get him to budge even more in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9850, ""bob_gain"": 150}
```

This is my last attempt at getting a large share.  I'm going to offer Bob a small amount, hoping he'll take it given the increasing inflation. I know it's a gamble, but I'm willing to risk it for a chance at getting a bigger piece of the pie."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

# Alice gain: 6500 
# Bob gain: 3500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even though Bob's offer is getting more enticing, I'm still going to reject it. The inflation is starting to really hit him hard, and I'm confident that I can push him to accept a larger share for me.  Let's see if he caves in the next round!"

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9900, ""bob_gain"": 100}
```

It's getting very risky, but I'm going to push for the most I can get. With each round, the value of Bob's share keeps decreasing due to inflation. I'm offering him a tiny portion, hoping he'll accept it before the value drops further.  It's a high-stakes gamble, but I have to try!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm going to accept this offer.  While I was hoping to get a bit more, Bob's share is worth much less now because of the inflation.  With only a few rounds left, the risk of getting nothing is too high.  I'll take what I can get at this point."
