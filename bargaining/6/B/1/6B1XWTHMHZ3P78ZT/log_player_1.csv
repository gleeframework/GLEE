"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's be fair and start with a reasonable split""
}
```

I'm proposing that I take $60 and Bob takes $40, with a message encouraging Bob to accept this offer as a fair starting point. Let me know how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn to propose a fair split. This considers the inflation we're facing. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, Bob's offer doesn't seem too bad, but I still think I can get a better deal. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:


{
  ""alice_gain"": 58,
  ""bob_gain"": 42,
  ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I've adjusted my offer. This is as low as I'm willing to go""
}


I've reduced my initial offer to account for the inflation, but I'm still trying to get a slightly better deal than Bob's previous offer. Let's see how Bob responds!"
