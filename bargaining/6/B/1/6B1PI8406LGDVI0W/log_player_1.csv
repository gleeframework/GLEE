"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable for a starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted a fair split, but I think I can do better than that. Let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation has already taken a bite out of my potential earnings!

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about taking only $2,000, especially since the money is worth 5% less than before. However, it's still a better option than walking away empty-handed.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now.
