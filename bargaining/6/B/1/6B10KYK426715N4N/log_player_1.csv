"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is 40% of the original amount. This way, we both get a decent chunk of money and can proceed to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $500,000 is now worth $450,000 (90% of $500,000).

I'll think about it... Meeting me halfway is a reasonable proposal, but I'd like to try to get a bit more. However, I don't want to risk getting nothing if Bob rejects my next offer. I'll accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
