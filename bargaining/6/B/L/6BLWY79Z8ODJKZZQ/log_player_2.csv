"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable and split fairly close to 50/50, but slightly in your favor, Bob, to account for the decreasing value over time. I propose you get $475,000 and I get $525,000. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

""bob_gain"": 520000,
""alice_gain"": 480000,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer was tempting, but let's be practical. Time is money, and with inflation eating into my share, I need a bit more to make it worthwhile. How about a 52/48 split in my favor?""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's stop wasting time.  I'm proposing a straight 50/50 split to get this done.  Every round that passes hurts you more than it hurts me. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
