"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to split the money more evenly, but I think a 55/45 split in my favor is fair, considering the inflation will hit you harder. Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500
