Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  Consider that the value of the money decreases faster for me than for you with each round.

# Alice gain: 6000

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to split the money more evenly, but I think a 55/45 split in my favor is fair, considering the inflation will hit you harder. Let's get this done!""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want to finalize this. Your offer was tempting, but the inflation rate demands I secure a larger share.  I propose 57/43. This ensures I'm not significantly disadvantaged in the long run, while still offering you a sizable portion. Let's be practical and wrap this up. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
