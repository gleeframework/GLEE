"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I take $60, you take $40. A fair deal for both of us considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's offer seems fair at first, I want to see if I can get a better deal. Since the inflation affects her more, I'm hoping to leverage that in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm hoping for a slightly better split for myself.  I propose you take $35, and I take $65.  Let's see if we can make this work.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, that offer wasn't fair considering the inflation working against me. I'm willing to compromise. I'll take $55, you get $45.  Let's close this deal before the money shrinks further. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer more, Alice's offer is better than the previous one, considering the inflation hitting her harder. It's a good compromise, and accepting avoids the risk of getting nothing."
