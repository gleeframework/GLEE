"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire for a bigger share, Bob, but let's not forget about inflation.  We're both losing value with each round.  This offer is a compromise, closer to your proposal but still fair considering the decreasing value of the money. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
