Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob.  Let's split it 60/40, with me taking the larger share since I'm the one making the offer.  We can both still get a decent amount, and this avoids further rounds where the money continues to lose value for you.

# Alice gain: 60
