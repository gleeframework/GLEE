"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer in JSON format:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it 60-40!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and I'll take $6,000. I think this is a reasonable offer, considering I'm the one making the first proposal. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the fairness of your offer but I believe a 60-40 split in my favor is more reasonable, given the potential for inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not happy with Bob's counteroffer, especially since the money is now worth 20% less. I think I can do better than that! Let's proceed to the next round and see if we can come up with a more mutually beneficial proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer in JSON format:


{
  ""alice_gain"": 5800,
  ""bob_gain"": 4200,
  ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve the bigger share.""
}


I've reduced my initial offer to account for the 20% decrease in value due to inflation, but I still believe I should get the larger share. Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this revised proposal!"
