Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're running out of time, Alice. Inflation is eating away at your share. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

This is a tough situation.  Here's why I'm rejecting:

* **Time Pressure:** Bob is right, time is working against me. However, accepting a deal out of desperation will lead to a very unfavorable outcome. 
* **Expected Value:** If I reject and propose in the next round, even with another 10% inflation hit, I can offer Bob something in the range of $350,000 and still get more than his current offer. 

It's a risky gamble, but I need to try and anchor Bob's expectations a bit higher."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 650000,
""bob_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""This is generous, Bob. Don't let this opportunity slip away.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Sensitivity:**  I need to acknowledge that time is a factor, and offer something that seems like I'm making a concession.
* **Anchoring:** My previous offer was too aggressive given the time pressure. This offer is still better than what Bob offered in Round 4, even after inflation, but positions it as a more appealing deal. 
* **Urgency:** The message aims to create a sense of urgency, suggesting this is a good deal that Bob should take before it's too late."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're losing a significant amount due to inflation. It's time to accept a reasonable offer. 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is brutal. Bob is clearly taking advantage of the situation. I have two options, neither of which is good:

1. **Accept:** I get $250,000 (heavily impacted by inflation, but still something).
2. **Reject:**  Even if I offer Bob $400,000 in the next round (leaving me with even less), there's no guarantee he'll accept, and the value will further decrease.

This is a classic example of the dangers of a shrinking pie in negotiations. Bob has correctly identified that I'm more motivated by the rapidly approaching deadline than he is.  

```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  While deeply unfair, accepting secures a small amount. Rejecting at this point is incredibly risky, with a high chance of walking away with nothing if Bob continues to play hardball."
