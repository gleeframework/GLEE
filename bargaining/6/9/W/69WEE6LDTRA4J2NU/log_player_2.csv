"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects the urgency for both of us to secure a good portion of the money before inflation eats away at it.

# Alice gain: 650000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm aiming for a mutually beneficial agreement. This offer ensures a good deal for both of us considering the inflation rates we're facing. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the fact that my money loses value faster than hers.  While 450,000 is a decent chunk, it's clear from her previous offer she's willing to go higher. I need to push for a more favorable split before inflation eats away too much of my potential gains."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 680000,
""alice_gain"": 320000,
""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time, and inflation is hurting both of us. I'm offering a deal where we both get a reasonable share considering the circumstances.  Take this offer before it's too late."" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** We're getting closer to the deadline, increasing the pressure on Alice to accept a deal.
* **Aggressive but Justified:** This offer is a strong move up from my previous, but the justification is tied to the rapidly shrinking pie. This emphasizes the cost of her stalling tactics.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** While this is my ideal split, I've left some space for a counter-offer in case Alice is completely unwilling to accept anything below a certain threshold."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final concession. This offer acknowledges the impact of inflation on both sides while ensuring we both walk away with a significant amount. It's time to decide - a deal or we both lose out. 
# Bob gain: 520000 
# Alice gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We are now past the halfway point and dangerously close to getting nothing.
* **Alice's Tone:**  Her message implies this is her last offer, increasing the risk of walking away with nothing if I reject.
* **Acceptable, Though Not Ideal:**  While I'd prefer a larger share, 520,000 is still a significant sum. Accepting now guarantees a decent payout, whereas continuing risks getting nothing at all. 

It's a tough decision, but the risk of ending up with nothing at this stage outweighs the potential for a slightly better deal in later rounds."
