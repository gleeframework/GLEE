# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with Bob's offer. I was hoping for a more balanced split, and giving me only $4,000 while keeping $6,000 for himself is not acceptable. I'd like to make a new proposal and try to get a better deal."
