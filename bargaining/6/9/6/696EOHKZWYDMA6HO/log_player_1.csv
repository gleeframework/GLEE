"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we each get $500,000. This is a reasonable starting point, and it's a good way to test the waters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but still a good deal 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 400,000 offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth 5% less, I'll have to think carefully about whether it's a good deal.

For now, I'll reject the offer. I'd like to make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer:

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but still a fair compromise""}

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, hoping that he'll be willing to compromise and meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I think it's a good compromise 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering the new offer, I'm not thrilled about the 300,000 share, but I'm running out of options. I'll have to think carefully about whether it's better to accept this offer or risk going to the next round.

For now, I'll reject the offer. I'd like to make another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

{""alice_gain"": 375000, ""bob_gain"": 625000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not willing to give up too much""}

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a decent share and holding onto as much value as possible."
