"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. This is a relatively equal split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but it's still a fair deal! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'm not too thrilled about giving Bob the majority, but I don't want to risk going to the next round. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the $3,000 and hope it's enough to get me through the next 10 rounds."
