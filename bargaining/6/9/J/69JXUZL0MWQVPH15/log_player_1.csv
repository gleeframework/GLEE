"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, giving us both $500,000 each."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my $500,000 is now worth 95% of its original value, so I'd be getting $475,000 if I accept this offer. Bob's offer is still a 60-40 split, but it's a bit more favorable to me than my initial offer.

I'll accept this offer.
