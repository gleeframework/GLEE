"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm going for a fair split, but I'll take the bigger share since I'm the one making the first offer.  Let's see what you think. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""I'm aiming for a more substantial share this round, Alice.  Let's avoid letting this money shrink any further.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bigger share to make this worthwhile for me.  Let's get this done before the money is worth even less! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving towards a more even split, the rate of inflation is working against me more than her. It's worth risking another round to aim for a larger share, even if it's slightly less than the current offer after another round of inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Time is running out Alice, and the money's value is dropping fast. This offer is a good compromise to finalize the deal this round.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This offer is a fair 50/50 split.  We've both been stubborn, but this is the best way to prevent further losses.  Let's agree and be done with it. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is finally offering a truly fair split. While I was hoping for a larger share, accepting a 50/50 split at this point is the most logical choice.  The inflation is eating away at the total value, and it's better to secure half the money now than risk getting a worse deal later or even ending up with nothing."
