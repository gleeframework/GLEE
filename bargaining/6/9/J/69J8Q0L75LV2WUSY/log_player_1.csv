"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering Bob 450,000 dollars, which is slightly less than half of the total amount, in the hopes that he'll accept it and we can end the game quickly. Since the money is worth less with each passing round, I want to try to reach an agreement as soon as possible. By framing it as a ""fair"" split, I'm trying to appeal to Bob's sense of reason and fairness, in the hopes that he'll be more likely to accept the offer.\n\nPlease let me know what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a slightly better split for me this time.  Let's settle this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 460000 
# Bob gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting this offer because, despite the effects of inflation, I believe I can get a better deal. Bob's offer gives him significantly more than half of the total amount, and I'm not willing to accept that. Since the money is worth less with each passing round, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's more favorable to me.\n\nLet's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 520000, ""bob_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle""}\n\n###\n\nI'm making a counteroffer that's closer to the middle ground. Since Bob's previous offer gave him 540,000, I'm offering him 480,000, which is still a relatively good deal for him. By framing it as ""meeting in the middle"", I'm trying to convey a sense of compromise and cooperation, in the hopes that Bob will be more likely to accept this offer.\n\nPlease let me know what Bob's response is!"
