"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, which is a relatively even division of the $100. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly. This way, we both get something and avoid the risk of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not sure if it's the best option for me. I'd rather try to negotiate further to get a better deal. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure 50-50 is the best I can get. I'll make a counteroffer.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth 20% less than in the second round, so the effective value is now 80% of the original amount. I'll take that into account when making my offer.

Here's my counteroffer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll compromise and give you 40. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed."
