Round 5

**Reasoning:**

While the effects of inflation are becoming very significant, accepting this offer would still mean a significant loss compared to what I could have gotten in the first round.  Alice is clearly aiming to get the lion's share and isn't acknowledging the impact of inflation fairly.  I'm willing to gamble that she'll become more reasonable in the next few rounds as the money continues to lose value."
