70.0,30.0,"Let's make a deal! I take $70, you take $30. This seems fair to me considering the money loses value for both of us over time.",Alice,1,

45.0,55.0,"Alice, your offer was a bit too lopsided. Let's be reasonable - I understand time is a factor, but so is fairness. How about we split it a bit more evenly?",Bob,2,

65.0,35.0,"Bob, I appreciate the offer, but it's still not quite there for me. Remember, the clock is ticking, and the value decreases with each round. I'll take $65, you get $35.  It's a strong offer considering the circumstances.",Alice,3,
