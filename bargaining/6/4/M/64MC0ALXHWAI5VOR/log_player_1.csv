"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40, which is a generous 40% of the original $100. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share this round, but I'm willing to compromise! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $20 is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $16. Bob's gain of $80 is worth 95% of its original value, which is $76.

Considering the offer, I'm not thrilled about giving up 76% of the remaining money. I'd like to make a counteroffer.

  ""message"": ""I'm not giving up that much, Bob! I'll make a counteroffer""
