"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split, considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\n### Assistant: Now it's my turn again. I'll send my next offer to Bob.\n{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Come on, let's find a middle ground!""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### Assistant: {""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Come on, let's find a middle ground!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm sticking with my previous offer. I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n### Assistant: {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI decided to accept Bob's offer. The inflation is making my potential gain worth significantly less with each passing round. Since Bob's offer remains the same and doesn't account for the inflation from my perspective, I'm essentially losing value with each rejection. Accepting now minimizes further loss due to inflation."
