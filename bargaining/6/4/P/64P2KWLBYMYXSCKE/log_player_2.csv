"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the money with a ratio of 3:1 in favor of you. I believe this is fair given the decreasing value of money.

# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 80,
""alice_gain"": 20,
""message"": ""I'll take 80 now, but I think I can do better in future rounds.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer, I propose a more equal split of 64:36. This maintains a balance while accounting for the diminishing value of money. 
# Bob gain: 36 
# Alice gain: 64 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
