"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to offer Bob a small share, hoping he'll be tempted to take it rather than risk getting nothing in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much better for him than mine was, and while it's a decent amount for me, I believe I can still get a better deal. The inflation rate is higher for Bob, so he's under more pressure to accept a deal. I'm going to try and leverage that in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to increase my offer slightly from the previous round.  This should make it more attractive to Bob, but still leave me with a significant share. The inflation pressure is increasing for Bob, and he's likely to be more willing to accept a deal closer to my preferred outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to 50/50, the inflation is hitting him harder than me. I'm going to hold out for a slightly better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}
```

I'm going to raise my offer slightly again, hoping to incentivize Bob to accept.  The pressure of inflation is increasing significantly for him, and I'm betting that he'll be more inclined to accept a deal that favors me a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob is finally offering a 50/50 split. While the inflation has taken a significant bite out of the value of the money, it's better to accept this offer than to risk getting nothing at all. The risk of further inflation, especially for Bob, makes this a safe bet."
