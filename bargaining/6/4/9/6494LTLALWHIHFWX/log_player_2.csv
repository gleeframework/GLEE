Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we can find a compromise that works for both of us.  This offer gives you a slightly larger share, but also takes into account the inflation we're facing. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```
## Reasoning

While the offer isn't ideal, it's important to consider the impact of inflation. 

* **Alice is losing value faster:** With each round, Alice loses 20% of the value, compared to my 10%. This makes her more likely to accept a less favorable deal as time goes on.
* **Future offers uncertain:**  There's no guarantee I can secure a better offer from Alice in subsequent rounds. 
* **Current offer reasonable:** 4800 is a significant amount, even with the 19% inflation. Rejecting this offer risks walking away with even less if a favorable deal doesn't materialize.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer in round 3 mitigates risk and secures a reasonable sum considering the circumstances."
