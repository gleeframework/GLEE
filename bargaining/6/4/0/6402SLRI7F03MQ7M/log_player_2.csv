Alice is playing a tough game, but I need to hold my ground a little longer. Accepting $40 now, while it seems like a lot less than earlier, is still better than nothing in round 12."

# Bob gain: 38 
# Alice gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This is a tough one. Alice is really turning the screws, but I'm hoping she'll start to panic as we get closer to the deadline too. I'm banking on her making a mistake in the next few rounds."

# Alice's message: You're running out of time, and inflation is killing your share. This is a generous offer, take it. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a difficult decision, but the pressure is on.  Alice is clearly willing to play hardball, and the longer this goes on, the less I'll get. While $35 is a much smaller share, it's better than risking getting nothing at all if we reach round 12."
