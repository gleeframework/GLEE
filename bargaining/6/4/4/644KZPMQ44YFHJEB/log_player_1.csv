Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fairer, considering we both have to deal with inflation. It's a compromise, but I think it's a good starting point for us to find a solution. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500
