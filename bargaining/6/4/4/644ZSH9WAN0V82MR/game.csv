6000.0,4000.0,Let's start fair. I propose we split it 60/40 in my favor. What do you say?,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,Your split wasn't in our best interest long term.  I'm proposing a more favorable split for me this round. Let's get this money while it's worth something!,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5000.0,5000.0,Let's be reasonable. We both lose money with every round. I propose an even split this time. We can both walk away with something.,Alice,3,
