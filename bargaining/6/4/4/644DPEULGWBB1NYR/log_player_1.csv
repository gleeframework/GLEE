"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000 dollars, which is 40% of the total. This way, I get 60% of the money, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll re-evaluate Bob's offer.

Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll calculate the effective values:

My gain: 450,000 * 0.8 = 360,000
Bob's gain: 550,000 * 0.95 = 522,500

I'll accept Bob's offer, as it seems reasonable considering the reduced values.
