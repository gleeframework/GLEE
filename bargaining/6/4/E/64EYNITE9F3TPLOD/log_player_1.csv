Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This offer is designed to be extremely favorable to me (Alice), but gives Bob a tiny incentive to accept rather than risk getting nothing at all in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer to get more, it's better to accept this 50/50 split.  With the inflation factor, I'm not sure I can get a better deal in future rounds, and there's a risk of getting nothing if I keep rejecting offers."
