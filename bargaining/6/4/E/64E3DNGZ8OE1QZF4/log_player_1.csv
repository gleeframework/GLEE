"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I can do better than that. How about this? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure's on!

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a bit too lopsided, Bob. I'm not sure I'm willing to give you the majority of the pot just yet.""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept Bob's offer, but I'm not rejecting it outright either. I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation. Your turn, Bob!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The game continues!

Considering the inflation, my offer is now worth 10% less than in the previous round. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. This split is a bit more in my favor, but I'm still willing to meet you halfway.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to give up that much. I think I can do better than this. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The game continues!

It looks like Bob's offer is very similar to his previous offer, but with a slight adjustment. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Déjà vu, Bob! This offer is almost identical to the one you made in round 2. I'm not convinced you're willing to meet me halfway.""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept Bob's offer, as it seems like he's not making a genuine effort to compromise. Your turn, Bob!"
