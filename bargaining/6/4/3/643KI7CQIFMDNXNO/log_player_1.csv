"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair and reasonable start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial 100$ and Bob gets 40%. I think this is a good starting point, and it gives us both a decent amount to work with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 55-45 is a better starting point.  It's a bit closer to an even split and gives us both a good starting point.  Let's see if we can agree! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about the 55-45 split, as I was hoping for a slightly better deal. I think I can do better than this. I'll reject the offer and wait for Bob to come back with a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway! Let's try for a 50-50 split. It's a fair and equal division, and we can both walk away happy.""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which I think is a reasonable and fair compromise. I'm willing to meet Bob halfway and try to find a mutually beneficial agreement."
