600000.0,400000.0,"I propose a 60/40 split in my favor, Bob. It's a strong opening offer, but consider the money loses value with each round!",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"I think a 55/45 split is a fairer start.  We both get more this way, and we can avoid the risk of inflation eating away at our potential gains.",Bob,2,

550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, I appreciate the negotiation, but I'm aiming for a larger share. Let's meet in the middle â€“ 55/45 in my favor. This is a fair offer considering the initial proposal and the looming inflation.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
475000.0,525000.0,"Let's split the difference again.  A 52.5/47.5 split keeps the deal fair, and minimizes the risk of us both getting significantly less as the rounds go on.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
510000.0,490000.0,"Bob, it's clear we both want a larger piece of the pie.  I'm willing to come down slightly to 51/49, reflecting a compromise while acknowledging the time pressure.  Let's settle this before inflation eats away at our potential gains further.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Alice, let's just split this evenly and be done with it. The inflation is getting out of hand, and we're both losing money every round.  50/50 is fair, and it minimizes our losses.  Let's get this done!",Bob,6,
