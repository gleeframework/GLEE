"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose to take 900,000 dollars and give Bob 100,000 dollars. This way, I get the majority, and Bob still gets something.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even with the inflation, I'm getting 500,000, which is a decent amount.  It's better than risking getting nothing if we keep going. Let's accept the offer and split the money."
