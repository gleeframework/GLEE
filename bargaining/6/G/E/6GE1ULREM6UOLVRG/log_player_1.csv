"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""I propose we divide the funds in a 3:1 ratio. This ensures a fair distribution considering the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. While your offer was fair, it's important to account for the inflation you mentioned. I believe this split provides a better balance for both of us considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
