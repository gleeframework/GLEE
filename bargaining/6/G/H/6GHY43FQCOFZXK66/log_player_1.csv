Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script, I propose we split the money 3:2 in my favor.  This is a fair and balanced approach, and it avoids the potential for further inflation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
