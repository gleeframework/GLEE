"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In the first round, I'd like to make a generous offer to Bob. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial amount, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation reducing the value of my gain, I need to be more cautious. Bob's offer seems quite generous, but I'm not sure if I should accept it. Considering the reduced value of my gain, I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In the third round, I'll try to make a more balanced offer, taking into account the reduced value of the money due to inflation. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000
}
```

This way, I'll get a slightly larger share, but not so large that Bob would reject it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation reducing the value of my gain even further, I need to be more aggressive in my decision-making. Considering the significant difference in the proposed gains, I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```"
