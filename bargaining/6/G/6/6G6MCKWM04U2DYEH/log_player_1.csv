"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take 60% and you can have 40%""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll evaluate Bob's offer. Since the money is worth less, I'd like to get a slightly larger share to compensate for the decrease in value. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth even less now. I'll make a new offer to try to get a better share:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to keep up with the inflation. This is my revised offer.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not willing to give away too much more 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money! Considering the reduced value, I'll have to be careful with my decision. Since Bob's offer is still a bit too low, I'll reject it:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really eating away at the value of the money! I'll try to make a new offer that takes into account the significant decrease in value. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 490000,
  ""bob_gain"": 510000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. Let's try to find a middle ground that works for both of us.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
