Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very aggressive offer.  I figure if Bob is being rational, he'll take even a single dollar.  We'll see how greedy he is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I would prefer to keep more, it's likely that Bob will keep rejecting offers until we get to a 50/50 split. Accepting now guarantees I get half the money, and with the inflation risk, it's not worth risking a worse outcome later."
