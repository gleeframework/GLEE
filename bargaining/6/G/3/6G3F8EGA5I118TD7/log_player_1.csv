"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'm willing to give you a small amount to get us started.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle, Alice. This way we both get a fair share.  
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I need to adjust my calculation accordingly.

For Round 1, I had proposed $8,000 for myself and $2,000 for Bob. Due to 5% inflation, the value of the money is now 95% of the original amount. So, my original $8,000 is now worth $7,600 (0.95 x $8,000).

Bob's offer for Round 2 is to split the money down the middle, with each of us getting $5,000. However, due to 20% inflation, the value of the money is now 80% of the original amount. So, Bob's original $2,000 is now worth $1,600 (0.8 x $2,000).

Considering the adjusted values, I'll decide whether to accept or reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, I'll make a new proposal for Round 3. Considering the 5% inflation, the money is now worth 95% of its original value.

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more this round, Bob. But I'm not giving up too much yet.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to give you a bit more this time, but we need to start getting closer to a 50/50 split.  Let's both be reasonable and compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the adjusted values due to inflation.

For Round 1, I had proposed $8,000 for myself and $2,000 for Bob. After 3 rounds of 5% inflation, the money is now worth 0.95^3 = 0.857375 (85.74%) of its original value. So, my original $8,000 is now worth $6,861.00 (0.857375 x $8,000).

For Bob's offer in Round 4, he's proposing $4,000 for me and $6,000 for himself. However, due to 20% inflation over 3 rounds, the value of the money is now 80% of the original amount, compounded over 3 periods. This is equivalent to (0.8)^3 = 0.512 (51.2%) of the original value. So, Bob's original $2,000 is now worth $1,024.00 (0.512 x $2,000).

Considering the adjusted values, I'll decide whether to accept or reject the offer.
