"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and call it a day!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we each get $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not being generous enough, let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think I'm being generous enough? I'm actually being quite generous, considering I'm giving away half of the money initially! I'm not willing to accept a 40/60 split, especially since I don't know how much the inflation will affect Bob's gain. I'll try to make a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 420000, ""bob_gain"": 580000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give away the farm!""}

I'm increasing my offer by $20,000, making it a 42/58 split. I'm still trying to get a better deal, but I'm willing to compromise a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to get desperate, but I still want a better deal! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about the 30/70 split, but I'm also getting a bit desperate since the money is worth less and less with each passing round. I think I can do better than this, so I'll reject the offer and try to make a better one in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 360000, ""bob_gain"": 640000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of!""}

I'm increasing my offer by $60,000, making it a 36/64 split. I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a better deal and protecting my own interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting desperate, but I still want a better deal! Last chance! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm not thrilled about the 20/80 split, but at this point, I'm really getting desperate. The money is worth so much less than it was initially, and I'm not sure how much more I can negotiate. I'll take the 20% and hope that it's enough to get me out of this situation."
