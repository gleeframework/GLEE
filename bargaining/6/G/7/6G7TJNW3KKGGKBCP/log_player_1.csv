I'm going to offer Bob $1,000 and keep $9,000 for myself.  I figure this is a good starting point, as it gives Bob something to work with and leaves me with a good majority of the money.  I'm curious to see if he'll accept this, or if he'll try to negotiate for more in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best option. Bob is now taking a larger share, and the next round will reduce the value of his offer for him.  Accepting now secures a significant amount of money for me."
