Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was heavily skewed in your favor. I propose a more equitable split, recognizing that continued negotiation hurts us both due to inflation, but impacts me significantly more. This offer demonstrates my willingness to be fair, but I'm also prepared to hold out for a reasonable outcome. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000
