"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $100, leaving Bob with 20%. The message is a friendly one, suggesting a fair starting point for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but still fair, don't you think? 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 10% less for me, I need to be more cautious. Considering Bob's offer, I think I can do better than 30%. I'll reject this offer and make a counter-proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure 30% is enough, Bob. I'll make a counteroffer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, Bob. This way, we both get a decent share.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 40% of the current value of the money, leaving Bob with 60%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's compromise and meet in the middle, just like you said, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob is trying to turn my own words against me! With the money worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I need to be careful. However, I think 50% is a reasonable compromise, and it's a fair split. I'll accept this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
