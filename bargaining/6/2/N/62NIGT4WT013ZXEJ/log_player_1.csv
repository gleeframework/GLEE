"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide it fairly, I'll take 60%""}\n\nI made an offer where I get 60% of the money ($600,000) and Bob gets 40% ($400,000). I also included a message suggesting that this is a fair division. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm aiming for a more equitable split. This offer accounts for the time value of money with the inflation working against us. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI decided to reject Bob's offer. Although the offer seems reasonable, I think I can get a better deal, especially considering the inflation rate affecting me is higher than Bob's. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a more reasonable split.""}\n\nI made an offer where I get 55% of the money ($550,000) and Bob gets 45% ($450,000). I also included a message explaining that I've taken inflation into account and believe this is a more reasonable division. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be realistic. This is my final offer before my share becomes significantly impacted by inflation.  It's a win-win if we settle now. 
# Alice gain: 490000 
# Bob gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on my potential gain, I think it's wise to accept Bob's offer at this point. The difference between our proposed splits is relatively small, and further rounds would only decrease the value of the money for both of us, but more so for me. It seems like a reasonable compromise to accept this offer and settle the game here."
