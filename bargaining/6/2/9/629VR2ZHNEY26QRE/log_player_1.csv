Let's see if we can get a better deal."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm offering a slightly higher split for myself, hoping to entice Bob to accept. I believe it's still a fair offer considering the inflation factor."

Bob's offer is getting increasingly unfair. I won't accept such a lopsided division, even if it means risking getting nothing. There are still rounds left, and I believe we can reach a more balanced agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}

I'm willing to compromise further, but I'm sticking to a split that's closer to 50/50. The inflation is getting serious, but I'm hopeful we can reach a deal before the value of the money diminishes too much."

{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is unacceptable. I'm not willing to be taken advantage of like this, even with the inflation factor. The money is shrinking, but so is Bob's chance of getting a significant share if we keep going. I'm confident we can find a more equitable solution in the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60}
```

I'm proposing a split that's closer to Bob's last offer, but with a slight increase for myself. This is a significant compromise given the diminishing value of the money, but I believe it's still a fair offer given the circumstances."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not going to accept such a low offer. It's clear Bob is trying to exploit the inflation, but I'm not willing to be taken advantage of. There are still a few rounds left, and I believe we can find a more equitable solution."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 35, ""bob_gain"": 65}
```

Time is running out. I'm making a final compromise, offering a larger share to Bob in hopes of reaching an agreement. While the value of the money is greatly reduced, I'm still hoping to secure some portion of it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99

This is a ridiculously low offer. Even with the massive inflation, I won't accept this. It's clear Bob is being stubborn, and I'm not willing to lose everything just to satisfy his greed."
