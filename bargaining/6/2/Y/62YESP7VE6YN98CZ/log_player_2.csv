"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my initial offer. I believe this is a fair distribution, but I'm open to negotiation. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible deal for Bob! While Alice is losing value faster, there's plenty of time to negotiate a much better split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Alice. This offer accounts for the time pressure we both face.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but this is my final offer. If we don't reach an agreement now, the value of the money will decrease significantly for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is still not a great deal for Bob, and Alice seems very eager to close the deal.  It's likely she'll offer a much better split in the next round as the devaluation will start to hurt her significantly."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""The clock is ticking, Alice. Let's end this now with a deal that reflects the diminishing value of our prize.""}"
