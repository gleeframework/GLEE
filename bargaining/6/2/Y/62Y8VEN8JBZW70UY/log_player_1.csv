"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'll take 60% and you can have 40%. Let's be fair and end this game quickly before inflation eats away our money!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn to propose a fair split. This accounts for the slight inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI don't think this is a fair split, considering the inflation. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5700, ""bob_gain"": 4300, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet in the middle""}\n\nI've taken into account the inflation from the past two rounds. This offer is more reasonable, considering the decreasing value of money. Let's end this game before we both lose more value!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the fairest option, especially with inflation increasing. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant decrease in value due to inflation, a 50/50 split seems like the best option at this point. Further rounds would only lead to more loss for both of us. It's wise to accept this offer and end the game here."
