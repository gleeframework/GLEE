"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fairer.  Let's see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $450,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, which is $405,000. I'm not sure if Bob's offer is any better than mine, but I'll consider it.

I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, my gain is worth 81% of its original value (90% of 90%), so my offer is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 486000,
  ""bob_gain"": 514000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle at 49/51. It's a fair compromise!""
}
```"
