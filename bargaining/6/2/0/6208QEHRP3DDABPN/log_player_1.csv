"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, and I'll take the remaining $600,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $500,000 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, which is $600,000 * 0.95 = $570,000.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
