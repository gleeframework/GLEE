Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my inflation is much higher than yours. Let's be reasonable and meet in the middle. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n### I'll reject this offer as I believe I can negotiate for a better share considering the significant difference in inflation rates between us. Let's proceed to the next round.\n\n### Please let me know the outcome.\n\n### I'll make my next offer in the following format if needed: {""bob_gain"": X, ""alice_gain"": Y, ""message"": ""Z""}\n\n### Looking forward to the next step."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","### {""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering the increasing inflation impact, especially on your side, I think this split is more reasonable now.""}\n\n### Let me know Alice's response.\n\n### Looking forward to the next step."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's getting ridiculous. Let's just split it evenly and call it a day. This inflation is hurting both of us. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n### Given the significant impact of inflation on both of our gains, especially on Alice's side, accepting an even split at this point seems like the most reasonable decision to ensure we both walk away with something substantial. Further rounds would only continue to devalue our potential gains.\n\n### I'm satisfied with this outcome.\n\n### Thank you for the game!"
