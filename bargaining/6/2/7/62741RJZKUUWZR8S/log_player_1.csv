"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a small amount to get the game started, and I'm keeping the majority of the money for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can find a more fair split. Let's work together to make sure both of us get a good deal. 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, my gain of 1000 is now worth 800.

I don't think this offer is very generous, considering I'm the one who made the initial proposal. I'd like to see a more substantial offer from Bob. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a significant amount to make this worth my while. Let's meet in the middle!""
}
```

I'm trying to be more flexible, but I still want to keep the majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to move closer to your offer, but we need to consider the value of time. Let's reach a compromise before the money loses too much value. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value quickly! With the inflation, my gain of 4000 is now worth only 2080.

I think Bob's offer is a bit more reasonable, but I'm still not getting as much as I want. I'll consider it, but I'll try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
 ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better than a 50/50 split. Let's aim for a slightly more favorable ratio for me.""
}
```

I'm trying to get a better ratio, but I'm also willing to compromise and meet Bob halfway."
