Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you want to split evenly, but the value of the money decreases for me each round.  How about a 60/40 split in my favor? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is a difficult negotiation with the value decreasing for me each round.  55/45 is still too low for me.  How about we settle close to the middle at 56/44? 
# Alice gain: 4400 
# Bob gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is trying to frame this as a difficult negotiation, he's still heavily favored even with the inflation.  He's aiming for just above a 50/50 split when the actual value of his cut is significantly less. I'll hold out for a better offer as the inflation will continue to work in my favor."
