"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leaving $4,000 for Bob. I'm framing it as a fair split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than the initial offer. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 10% less, I need to be careful not to give up too much.

However, meeting in the middle seems like a reasonable compromise, and it's a relatively equal split. I'll accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
