"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

This means I'm offering to take $6,000 and leave $4,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 10% inflation, my potential gain is now worth 90% of $6,000, which is $5,400.

Bob's offer is to split the money equally, which means I would get $5,000 and Bob would get $5,000.

I think this is a fair offer, and I'm willing to accept it.
