"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40. You can't do better than this!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $10,000, which is $6,000, and leaving $4,000 for Bob. I'm hoping Bob will accept this generous offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","In the second round, the money is worth less due to inflation, so I need to adjust my calculations.

If I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $5,000, which is worth 95% of the original $6,000 I offered in the first round (since 5% less due to inflation). This is a good deal for me.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
