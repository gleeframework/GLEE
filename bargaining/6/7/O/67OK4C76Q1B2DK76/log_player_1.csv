"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make the first proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly. In this case, I'd be getting 45% of the initial $1,000,000, which is a slightly better deal than my initial offer.

I'll accept this offer.
