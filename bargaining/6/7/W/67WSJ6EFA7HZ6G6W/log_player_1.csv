"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable for a starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 5000 each is a fair starting point. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the $5000 I would gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so I'd actually be getting $4500 in terms of purchasing power.

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept Bob's offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
