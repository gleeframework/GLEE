"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives me 90% of the money, leaving 10% for Bob.  It's a generous offer in the first round, but I want to see how he reacts.  If he rejects, I know he's being greedy, and I can adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much worse than my first offer, even with the inflation taken into account.  I need to be firm and show him that I'm not going to accept unfair deals.  It's his turn to propose again, and I'll see if he's willing to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to stick to my initial strategy.  I'm confident I can get a better deal than Bob's last offer. By offering him 20%, I'm showing I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still aiming for a significant share.  If he rejects this offer, I'll have to consider a more aggressive approach."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a difficult decision.  My share is much lower than what I was aiming for, and the inflation is really hitting hard. But, it's an even split, and if I reject, I risk getting nothing at all in the next round.  It's time to be realistic and secure something rather than risk losing everything."
