"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. Take this offer before inflation eats away at your potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 15 
# Alice gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Alice, my turn. Inflation is a pain, so let's settle this quickly. I'll take the bigger hit this round, but we need to be more equitable.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The clock is ticking, Bob. This is a fair offer considering the inflation working against you. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm serious about a fair deal. This is my final offer before the inflation makes it pointless for me to continue.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Take this offer now, or you'll be left with crumbs! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, the impact of inflation is severe. While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer ensures I receive something rather than risking a worse outcome in the next round where the value of my potential gain diminishes even further."
