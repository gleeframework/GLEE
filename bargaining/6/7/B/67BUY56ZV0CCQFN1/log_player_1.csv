"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation has already taken a bite out of my potential earnings!

After calculating the new values due to inflation, I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 20% less, my gain of $400,000 would be worth $320,000 in real terms, and Bob's gain of $600,000 would be worth $480,000.

I'll reject this offer because I'd prefer to get a better deal.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Now it's my turn to make a new offer. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a higher share to account for the reduced value of money.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the remaining $1,000,000, and Bob gets 45%."
