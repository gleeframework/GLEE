# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer.  It's not a fair split.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to accept a deal that gives me so much less than Alice."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'm confident we can find a win-win solution as the game progresses.""

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

While Alice's offer is closer to a 50/50 split, it's still not fair considering the inflation rates. I'm going to reject this offer and see if we can reach a more equitable agreement in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 450000,

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting a bit desperate, Bob. I need a better deal to make this worth my while. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

While Alice's message indicates she's becoming more desperate, her offer is still too far off from fair. The inflation is hitting her harder, but I'm not going to take advantage of that. I'm going to hold out for a more equitable agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""message"": ""Alice, we are both losing money with each round. Let's compromise and split the difference from my last offer. This is a win-win, and we can both walk away with something.""

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer, Bob. Take it or leave it. I'm not getting any younger, and I need to make a profit. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice's final offer is simply unacceptable. Despite the inflation hitting her harder, it's still far from fair. I'm going to hold out for a better deal.  There's still time left, and we can both get a better outcome if we negotiate further."

Round 8

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 83.22% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my last stand, Bob. Take it or leave it. I'm not getting any younger, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to walk away with almost everything if I have to. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice's offer is getting increasingly desperate, but I'm not going to give in to pressure tactics. I'm still confident we can find a more equitable solution.  I'm going to hold out for a fairer deal. We both have more to lose by not reaching an agreement."

Round 11
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 65.13% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 89.26% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final, final offer, Bob. Take it or leave it. I'm not going to negotiate any further. I need to make a profit, and I'm willing to walk away with almost everything. 
# Bob gain: 50000 
# Alice gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice's offer is becoming increasingly unreasonable and shows a lack of willingness to compromise.  Even though inflation is hitting her harder, I am not willing to accept such a meager share.  We are both losing money with each passing round, and we are both better off finding a solution that allows us to walk away with something.  I'm going to reject this offer and see if we can reach a more reasonable agreement in the final round."
