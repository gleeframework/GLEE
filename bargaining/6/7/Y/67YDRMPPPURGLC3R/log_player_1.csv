Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split is more fair, considering the money is losing value faster for you than for me. Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
