"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 400k""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair, given the inflation factor.  Let's make a deal! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob's offer is identical to mine from the first round! Given that the money is worth 20% less, I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal for myself.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's the same offer I made, and I'd like to get a better deal considering the reduced value of the money""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll aim for a slightly higher share. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going all the way to 50/50""
}
```"
