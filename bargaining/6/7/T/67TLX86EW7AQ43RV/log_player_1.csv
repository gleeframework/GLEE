"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you get 40%. Let's move on to the next round!""
}
```

This way, I get a significant portion of the money, but it's still a reasonable offer, and I'm leaving room for Bob to make a counteroffer."
