Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60/40 split in my favor, acknowledging your initial offer but taking into account the inflation affecting us both. This allows for a more equitable distribution considering the changing value of the money. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
