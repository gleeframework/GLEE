Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we are both losing money with each round. My previous offer was fair considering the inflation. Let's settle this - I'm taking a small step towards a compromise. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want this over. I'm sticking close to my Round 3 offer, factoring in the significant inflation we're BOTH experiencing.  Let's be realistic and end this. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, the game dynamics are turning against Bob.  While Alice is losing value more quickly, Bob is also feeling the impact of inflation.  

Here's why accepting is (barely) the best option at Round 5:

* **Shrinking Pie:** The longer the game continues, the less money is actually on the table due to the accelerating inflation. 
* **Alice's Stubbornness:** Alice has shown a willingness to stick close to her initial offer.  There's a real risk she won't budge much further.
* **Slight Improvement:** While not ideal, Alice's Round 5 offer is slightly better than her Round 3 offer for Bob.

**Important Note:** There's a strong case for rejecting one more time to see if Alice panics with the inflation accelerating. However, it's a risky gamble, as Alice might call Bob's bluff."
