"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take $6,000 and you get $4,000. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but still a fair split. Your turn to decide! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the value of the money has decreased, so I need to think carefully about the proposal.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 30-70 split, especially considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation. I'll wait for Bob's next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise. I'll take $4,200 and you get $5,800. This way, we can both get a decent share.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to a 42-58 split, taking into account the reduced value of the money due to inflation. Your turn, Bob!"
