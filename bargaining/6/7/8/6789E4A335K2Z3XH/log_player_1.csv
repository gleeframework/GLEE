"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 40% and take the rest.""
}
```

Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly higher share, but I think 60-40 is a more reasonable split. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 5% inflation, my gain of $4000 is now worth $3800.

I'm not willing to accept a 40% share, but I'll consider a slightly higher offer. However, I think 60-40 is still a bit too skewed towards Bob.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll consider a higher share, but 55-45 might be more reasonable.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the 5% inflation, my gain of $3800 is now worth $3610.

Here's my revised proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55-45 is a fairer split.""
}
