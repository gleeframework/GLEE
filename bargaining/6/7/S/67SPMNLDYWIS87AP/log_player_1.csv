"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose to keep 900,000 dollars and give Bob 100,000 dollars. This seems like a fair starting point, considering the potential for inflation. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. While I understand Bob is now taking the lead,  I am confident I can negotiate a better deal. My gain is worth significantly less than in the first round due to inflation, and Bob's offer doesn't reflect that. I believe I can get a better deal if we keep playing."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I propose to keep 600,000 dollars and give Bob 400,000 dollars. This offer acknowledges the inflation affecting my gains, but also shows a willingness to compromise. I believe this is a fair deal considering the circumstances."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. While inflation has significantly impacted my potential gains, I am still unwilling to accept such a low share. I believe I can still negotiate a better deal with Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I propose a 50/50 split. Given the significant impact of inflation on my share, I believe this is the most equitable solution at this point. It allows us both to gain something, albeit less than we would have initially desired, and avoids the risk of ending up with nothing."
