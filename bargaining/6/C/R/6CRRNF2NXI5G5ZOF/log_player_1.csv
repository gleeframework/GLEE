"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can split the remaining $100,000 in a future round if you want!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small amount, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. I'm offering a 55/45 split. It's a good deal for both of us, and we can avoid the risk of inflation eroding our gains further. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I'll have to be more cautious with my decision. The offer is indeed more generous than mine in the first round, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject the offer for now and try to negotiate further. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth 40% of its original value due to inflation. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 320000,
  ""bob_gain"": 680000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but still trying to get a better deal for myself."
