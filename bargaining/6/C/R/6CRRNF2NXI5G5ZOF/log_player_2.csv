"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Accept this generous offer and we can split the remaining $100000 in a future round if you want! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While the offer seems tempting, it's better to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  The inflation factor means even a small percentage point shift in our favor could be significant in the future."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Let's be fair. I'm offering a 55/45 split. It's a good deal for both of us, and we can avoid the risk of inflation eroding our gains further.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Take it or leave it! 
# Bob gain: 680000 
# Alice gain: 320000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer a more even split, the inflation factor is starting to bite. This offer guarantees a significant gain, and there's no guarantee Alice will offer a better deal in the next round. It's time to take the win."
