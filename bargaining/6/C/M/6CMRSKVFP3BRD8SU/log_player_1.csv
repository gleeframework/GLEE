"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the money, and Bob gets 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less now, I'll get 50% of 80% of the original amount, which is 40 dollars. Not bad, but I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. I'll reject it for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","With inflation, the money is worth 20% less than in round 2, so I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money, I'll calculate the actual amount I'd get from Bob's offer: 40% of 60.48% of the original amount (since 100 * 0.788 = 78.8, and 78.8 * 0.512 = 40.416). That's about 40.42 dollars.

I'll accept this offer, as it's a decent deal considering the reduced value of the money.
