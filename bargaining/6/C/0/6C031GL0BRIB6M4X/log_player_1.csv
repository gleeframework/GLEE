"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20, seems fair?""
}
```

I'm proposing a split that gives me 80% of the money, which is $8,000, and Bob gets 20%, which is $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 60-40 is a better split 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 20% less, so the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 6000 / 0.8 = 7500
* Bob gain: 4000 / 0.8 = 5000

I'm not too thrilled about this split, but I'll consider it. I'll reject this offer for now.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is now worth 40% of its original value. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""bob_gain"": 6000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bigger share, but I think 40-60 is a fair split""
}
```

I'm proposing a split that gives me 40% of the money, which is $4,000, and Bob gets 60%, which is $6,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, let's try 50-50 this time 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts considering the 48.8% inflation:

* Alice gain: 5000 / 0.5168 = 9693.19 (approximately)
* Bob gain: 5000 / 0.5168 = 9693.19 (approximately)

I think this is a reasonable split, and I'm willing to accept it.
