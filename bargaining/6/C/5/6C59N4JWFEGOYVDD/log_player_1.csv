"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 999,999,
  ""bob_gain"": 1,
  ""message"": ""You get 1 dollar, I get almost everything. Accept?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob just 1 dollar, while I get the remaining 999,999 dollars. The message is a bit cheeky, but I'm hoping Bob will accept the offer and we can end the game early!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a fair share, let's end this quickly 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not sure if Bob's offer is really ""fair"". I think he's trying to take advantage of the fact that the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, while his gain is worth 20% less. I'll reject this offer and try to do better in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 800,000 for me, and it's worth 20% less than the initial value, I'll try to take that into account and make a counteroffer. I'll offer Bob a smaller amount, but one that's worth more in real terms.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900,000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100,000,
  ""message"": ""You're trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I'm not falling for it!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 100,000 dollars, which is worth 20% less than the 125,000 he would have gotten in the first round. I'm keeping 900,000 dollars for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not taking advantage of me, but I'm still trying to get a fair deal 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to adjust his offer to account for the increasing inflation, but I'm not sure if he's taking into account the fact that my gain is still worth the same as in the first round.

I'll do some quick math to compare the real value of Bob's offer. Let's say the initial value of the money is $1. If the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, that's $999,999. But since Bob's gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, his gain is worth 51.2% of the initial value, which is 0.512 * $1 = $0.512. So, his offer is equivalent to $0.512 in real terms.

Now, let's compare this to my gain of $999,999. I think I can do better than that!

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I think I've got a good sense of the inflation rate now. I'll try to make a more informed offer. Since Bob's gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'll offer him a smaller amount that's worth more in real terms.

Let's calculate the real value of Bob's gain in the first round, which was 800,000. Since it's worth 51.2% of the initial value, that's 0.512 * $1 = $0.512 in real terms. So, I'll offer Bob 600,000, which is worth 0.6 * $1 = $0.6 in real terms.

I'll keep the remaining amount for myself.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 400,000,
  ""bob_gain"": 600,000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting closer, but I'm not going to give you everything!""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not backing down, let's meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not sure if he's taking into account the fact that my gain is still worth the same as in the first round.

Let's do some quick math to compare the real value of Bob's offer. Since Bob's gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round, his gain is worth 32.77% of the initial value, which is 0.3277 * $1 = $0.3277 in real terms.

I'll compare this to my gain of $999,999. I think I can do better than that!

However, I also notice that Bob's offer is closer to the middle ground than before, and I don't want to reject it outright. I'll think about it for a moment...

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer, taking into account the increasing inflation rate. Since Bob's gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round, I'll offer him an even smaller amount that's worth more in real terms.

Let's calculate the real value of Bob's gain in the first round, which was 800,000. Since it's worth 32.77% of the initial value, that's 0.3277 * $1 = $0.3277 in real terms. I'll offer Bob 200,000, which is worth 0.2 * $1 = $0.2 in real terms.

I'll keep the remaining amount for myself.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800,000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200,000,
  ""message"": ""You're running out of time, Bob!""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Last chance, let's split it 50/50 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to make a final push for a 50/50 split. I'll have to consider whether this is a good deal or not.

Let's calculate the real value of Bob's gain in the first round, which was 800,000. Since it's worth 20.97% of the initial value (100% - 79.03%), that's 0.2097 * $1 = $0.2097 in real terms. With this in mind, I'll compare the real value of Bob's offer.

If we split the money 50/50, I would get $500,000, which is worth $0.5 in real terms. This is a good deal for me, considering the inflation rate.

  ""decision"": ""accept""

I'll accept Bob's offer and we can end the game!"
