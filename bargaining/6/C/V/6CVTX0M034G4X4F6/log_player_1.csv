I'm going for a very aggressive first offer. I want to secure as much of the money as possible before the inflation kicks in."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a classic negotiation scenario! Bob is using the power of the impending inflation to try and get a much better deal. I reject his offer because I am confident I can get a better deal in the future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm still aiming for a large share, but I'm lowering my demand a bit to account for the inflation. Bob is clearly playing hardball, so I need to find a balance between securing a good deal and risking running out of time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is pushing hard, but I'm still not willing to settle for such a small share. The inflation is definitely biting, but I'm confident I can secure a better deal in the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

The inflation is taking a toll, and I need to start being more realistic. I'm proposing a 50/50 split to see if Bob is willing to compromise. This is a fair offer, and hopefully, it will prevent us from getting nothing in the end."
