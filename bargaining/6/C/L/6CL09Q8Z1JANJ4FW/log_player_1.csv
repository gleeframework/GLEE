"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we should split it 50/50, considering we don't know how inflation will affect each of us. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
