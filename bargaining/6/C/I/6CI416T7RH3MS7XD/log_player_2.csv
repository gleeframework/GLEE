Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we've both been playing this game for a while now.  I'm willing to give you a better deal than the last round, but this is my final offer.  If we can't agree, we'll both lose more money. Let's find a compromise. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in Round 5 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Declining leads to greater losses:** If I reject this offer, the money depreciates further for Alice in the next round. This makes it highly likely she'll offer even less favorable terms, possibly pushing the split closer to an even 50/50, which is a worse outcome than the current offer. 
* **Alice's Final Offer:** She has stated this is her final offer, adding weight to the possibility of a worse deal in subsequent rounds.
* **Time Value:**  While I'm not getting the most favorable split, getting something now outweighs the risk of getting even less later.

It's a tough decision, but accepting minimizes potential losses and secures a reasonable amount now."
