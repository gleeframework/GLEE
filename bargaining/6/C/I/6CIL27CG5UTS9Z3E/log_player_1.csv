{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $10,000, which is $6,000, and Bob gets the remaining 40%, which is $4,000."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better. This split is fairer for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

I'm not thrilled about accepting this offer, but it's not a bad deal either. I'll decide to...
