"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, we can negotiate from here""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm leaving the door open for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit less, but I think this is a fair starting point 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $4000 is now worth 90% of its original value, so it's equivalent to $3600 in the first round's value.

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a bit too skewed towards you, I'd like to negotiate further""
}
```

I'm rejecting the offer and hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 81% of its original value (90% of 90% = 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more""
}
```

I'm increasing my proposed gain to $4200, which is worth approximately $3888 in the first round's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think 5500 is the most I'm willing to give 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $4500 is now worth 72.9% of its original value (100% - 27.1% = 72.9%).

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to get closer to 50/50, this is still a bit too skewed towards you""
}
```

I'm rejecting the offer and hoping to get a more balanced deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 63.6% of its original value (100% - 27.1% - 10% - 10% - 10% = 63.6%).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4800,
  ""bob_gain"": 5200,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more than 48%""
}
```

I'm increasing my proposed gain to $4800, which is worth approximately $3888 in the first round's value, but I'm getting closer to the 50/50 split."
