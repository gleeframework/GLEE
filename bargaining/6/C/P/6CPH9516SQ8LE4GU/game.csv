900000.0,100000.0,Let's start with a fair deal. I'll take 90% and leave you 10%. We can work out a better deal later if you want.,Alice,1,

300000.0,700000.0,"Let's be realistic, Alice. I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor. Take it while it's still a good deal for you, considering the inflation.",Bob,2,

600000.0,400000.0,"I'm willing to compromise, but 70/30 is still too much in your favor. Let's split it 60/40, and I'll take the smaller share. We both get something, and we avoid further inflation.",Alice,3,

250000.0,750000.0,"Alice, the clock is ticking and inflation is eating away at your potential gains.  I'm sticking with a 75/25 split. This is your last chance for a decent payout.",Bob,4,

500000.0,500000.0,I'm tired of this back-and-forth. Let's be fair and split it 50/50. This is a reasonable compromise considering the inflation. It's better than us both getting nothing!,Alice,5,
