"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share this time, but hopefully we can find a more even split later. 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see what Alice offers in the next round!  While I'm not a fan of being offered just $10, I'm hoping that Alice will realize it's in her best interest to work towards a more even split.  The inflation will hurt her more than me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit less this time to show I'm open to a more even split.  Let's see if we can find a solution we both like.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still think a 60/40 split is fair given the inflation.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd still prefer a more even split, I'm starting to feel the pressure of the inflation. Accepting this offer gives me a decent amount, and I'm not sure I can get much better in the next round with Alice being more affected by inflation. It's time to cut my losses and take what I can get."
