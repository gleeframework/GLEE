"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. You can try to negotiate from here!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is 10% of the original amount, and keeping the rest for myself. This way, we can both get a decent amount right from the start. Now it's Bob's turn!"
