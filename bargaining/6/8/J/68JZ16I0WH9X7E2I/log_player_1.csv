"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to be greedy in the first round. I'll offer Bob a measly $1. I'm hoping he'll be tempted to accept, but if not, I'll have a chance to adjust my offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer more, the risk of getting nothing if we keep going is too high. A 50/50 split is a good outcome in this situation."
