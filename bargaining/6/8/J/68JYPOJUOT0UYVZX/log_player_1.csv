"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more equitable, considering the value of the money will decrease in future rounds. Let's be fair to both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{
