Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a 60/40 split in my favor. I think this is a fair starting point, as I am the one making the initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred a larger share, the 50/50 split is a fair compromise, especially considering the risk of further inflation."
