"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, but I think we should start with a fair offer. Take 10% and we'll see how it goes. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
This offer is very bad for Bob. It is better to reject the offer and see what Alice proposes next, knowing that the money will be worth less for Alice in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 9000,
""alice_gain"": 1000,
""message"": ""Let's be realistic, I'll take 90% and you can have the remaining 10%.  We both know this money is worth less with every passing round, so it's best to secure a good share while we can.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I understand we both want a larger share. Let's compromise. I'll take 55% and you can have 45%.  We're getting closer to the end, so let's make this happen! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even with inflation, getting 45% is a good deal.  There's a risk of getting a worse offer in the next round.  It's time to lock in a solid gain."
