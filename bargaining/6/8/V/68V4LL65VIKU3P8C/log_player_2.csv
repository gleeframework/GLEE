Alice's offer:

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Alice, my turn. Let's be reasonable. 50/50 split doesn't work considering the inflation, so I propose a 55/45 split in my favor.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the inflation, but 55/45 is still too much in your favor. Let's compromise at 60/40. This way we both get a decent share. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000
