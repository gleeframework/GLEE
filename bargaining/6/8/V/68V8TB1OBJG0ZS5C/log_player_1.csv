"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

This is a generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can avoid further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, I need to adjust my thinking accordingly. In this round, the money is worth 95% of its original value.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to do better in the next round. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, the money is now worth 90.25% of its original value (95% * 95%).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 490000,
  ""bob_gain"": 510000
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive in this round, hoping to get a better deal."
