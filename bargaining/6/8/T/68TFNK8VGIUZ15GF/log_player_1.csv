"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\n###\n\nI am offering Bob 450,000 dollars, which is a bit less than half, but still a significant amount. I am hoping that Bob will accept this offer, considering that the value of the money will decrease in the next round. I am also trying to make it clear that I am willing to be fair, but I am not willing to give up too much. Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your turn to be generous. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI am not willing to accept this offer, as I believe I can get a better deal in the next round. Although the value of the money is decreasing, I think I can still negotiate for a larger share. Additionally, Bob's message saying it's his final offer seems like a bluff, and I'm not buying it. I'll take my chances and make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""I'm not buying the 'final offer' bluff""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I am increasing my proposed share to 580,000 dollars, while decreasing Bob's share to 420,000 dollars. I am trying to take advantage of the fact that the value of the money is decreasing more rapidly for Bob, which may make him more willing to accept a smaller share. My message is a clear reference to Bob's previous ""final offer"" statement, which I believe was a bluff. I'm calling his bluff and making a more aggressive offer. Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The clock is ticking, let's settle this. This is my actual final offer. 
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant decrease in value due to inflation, I think it's time to accept Bob's offer. Although I was hoping to get a better deal, the current offer is still reasonable, and the risk of further decreasing the value of the money is too high. Bob's message seems more sincere this time, and I believe he is willing to walk away if I reject this offer. I'll take the 520,000 dollars, which is still a significant amount, and end the game here."
