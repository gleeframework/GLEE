"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be fair and avoid excessive rounds. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor to account for the inflation disadvantage I have.  This way we both leave with a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 6000,
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your fairness in the first round. However, I believe a 60/40 split in my favor is a more equitable way to account for the inflation disadvantage you have. It's a compromise, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable solution in the next round.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but a 60/40 split in your favor is too drastic considering the inflation. I'm proposing a compromise of 55/45, which acknowledges the time-value of the deal while still being fair to both of us. Let's settle this now and avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500
