"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Bob, let's be fair and avoid excessive rounds. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor to account for the inflation disadvantage I have.  This way we both leave with a good amount.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your fairness in the first round. However, I believe a 60/40 split in my favor is a more equitable way to account for the inflation disadvantage you have. It's a compromise, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable solution in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but a 60/40 split in your favor is too drastic considering the inflation. I'm proposing a compromise of 55/45, which acknowledges the time-value of the deal while still being fair to both of us. Let's settle this now and avoid further losses.""}"
