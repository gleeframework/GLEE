"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a proposal. Since the inflation is 20% per round, I'll aim to get a larger share now to compensate for the loss of value later. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gains, I need to be more cautious. I'll consider the reduced value of the money I'll receive. Since Alice's offer is closer to the initial 50-50 split, I'll accept it this time.
