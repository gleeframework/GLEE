"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

This way, I get the majority of the money, but still leave Bob with a decent amount."

# Alice gain: 360000 
# Bob gain: 640000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money, Bob's offer is quite generous, but I'll try to negotiate further.
