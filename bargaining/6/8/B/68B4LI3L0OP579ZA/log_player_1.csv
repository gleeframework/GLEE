I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor, leaving Bob with the smaller share. This seems fair given the potential for inflation in future rounds.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, accepting Bob's offer is the best strategy in this situation. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The value of my potential gains is decreasing with each round.  Accepting now means I get at least something.
* **Risk:**  Rejecting Bob's offer means I have to make a counter-offer. There's a chance he might reject that too, and the value of the money keeps decreasing.  
* **Potential Gain:** Although a 60/40 split isn't ideal, it's still a significant gain considering the inflation factor.

It's a calculated risk, but accepting this offer seems like the best way to secure at least some of the potential value."
