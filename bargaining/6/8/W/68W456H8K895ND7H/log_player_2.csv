"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. 60/40 split seems fair considering the inflation working against you. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll take my chances with the next round. The 60/40 split doesn't seem fair to me, considering the inflation rate is higher for me. I'm hoping to get a better offer or make a counteroffer that benefits me more. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think 55/45 is a more reasonable split. It's my turn to make an offer, and I'm hoping we can settle on this.""}\n\nLet me know if this is acceptable to Alice or if we need to proceed to the next round!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is literally money in this game, and it's disappearing faster for you. I'll come down slightly to 58/42. Take it before it shrinks further! 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer. Considering the inflation, Alice's offer doesn't improve my situation significantly enough. The difference in inflation rates between us means I'm losing more value with each round, but I'm hoping that Alice will be motivated to settle soon due to her own loss in value. I'll hold out for a better offer or try to negotiate further, even though the pressure of inflation is mounting. Let's see what the next round brings!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 520000, ""alice_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""I understand we're both losing value, but I believe 52/48 is a more balanced split considering the inflation difference. Let's settle before it's too late!""}\n\nLet me know if Alice finds this acceptable or if we're proceeding to the next round!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm dropping my offer to 55/45. You're losing serious money with every refusal.  Take the deal now! 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll accept this offer. Given the significant loss in value due to inflation, especially on my end, I think accepting the 55/45 split is the best decision at this point. Continuing further risks losing even more value, and this offer seems relatively fair considering the circumstances. It's time to settle and make the most of what's left.### {""decision"": ""accept""}"
