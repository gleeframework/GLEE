"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

``` 
I'll start by offering Bob a small amount, hoping he'll be willing to accept it in the early stages.  Let's see if he takes the bait!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll accept this offer.  While I'm getting a smaller share than I initially wanted, it's better than risking getting nothing at all in the later rounds due to inflation."
