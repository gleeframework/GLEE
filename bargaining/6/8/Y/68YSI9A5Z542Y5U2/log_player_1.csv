"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\n\n###\n\nI'll offer Bob 40% of the money and keep 60% for myself. The message ""Let's be fair"" is a simple and straightforward way to convey that I'm willing to share the money, but I also want to make sure I get a significant portion. Since the money loses value for me with each passing round, I want to try to reach an agreement quickly. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, and avoid the risk of inflation! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nSince the money is worth 5% less for me in this round, Bob's offer of an even split is not as attractive as it would have been in the first round. I'm willing to take the risk of further inflation to try to get a better deal. Additionally, I want to see if Bob is willing to compromise further. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle of our previous offers""}\n\nI'll offer Bob a bit more than my initial offer, but still less than the even split he proposed. The message suggests that I'm willing to compromise and find a middle ground between our previous offers. Since the money is losing value for me, I want to try to reach an agreement soon, but I'm not ready to give up too much yet. Let's see how Bob responds!"
