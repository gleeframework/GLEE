"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

I'm offering 70 dollars for myself and 30 dollars for Bob. This way, I get a slight majority, but Bob still gets a decent share. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 50 * 0.9 = 45
* Bob gain: 50 * 0.9 = 45

I'll accept this offer.
