"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, see if we can do better later""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm curious to see if we can negotiate a better deal later on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 4000, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the offer from Bob, I'll decide to reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think I can do better than 4000. I'll wait for the next round to make a new proposal or counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the effects of inflation, my potential gain is worth 10% less than in the previous round. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going all the way to 60/40""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a slightly better deal and keeping some value for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 3500, but I think I'm getting closer to a fair deal 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effects of inflation, my potential gain is worth significantly less than in the first round. Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think 3500 is still too low, given the original amount of $10,000. I'll wait for the next round to see if Bob is willing to increase his offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the effects of inflation, my potential gain is worth 36.9% less than in the first round. Here's my new offer:

  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm not getting too little""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a better deal and keeping some value for myself, while also considering the decreasing value of money due to inflation."
