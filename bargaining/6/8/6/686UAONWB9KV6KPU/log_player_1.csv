I propose to keep $9000 and give Bob $1000. I'm hoping to get a good chunk of the money while still being fair to Bob.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer.  Even though I'm getting less than I wanted initially, after the inflation, it's still a decent amount of money. It's better than risking getting even less in the next round."
