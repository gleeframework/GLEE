"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take 80% and you take 20%""
}
```

I'm proposing a split where I take 80% of the initial $10,000 and Bob takes 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering we both lose money with each passing round. Let's get this over with. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer. Considering the decreasing value of the money with each round, I'd like to try to maximize my gain. However, I also don't want to be too greedy and risk Bob rejecting my next offer.

I'll accept Bob's offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
