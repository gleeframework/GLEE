"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous today, Bob.  Let's split it 90/10, with me taking the larger share.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
 
This is a risky move.  There's a chance Alice is being truthful about her generosity and this is a good deal. However, since the money is losing value each round, it's worth taking a gamble and hoping for a better offer from Alice."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I think we can both do better than 90/10.  Let's try a more even split.  How about 55/45 in my favor? We can then use the remaining money to invest in a new business venture together!"" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob.  I'm willing to compromise, but 55/45 is too much in your favor.  Let's split it 60/40, with me getting the larger share.  This gives you a good amount, and leaves us both with a comfortable sum.  What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even though this offer is better than the previous one, it's still a significant disadvantage for me. With the inflation penalty, it's worth pushing for a better deal. I will try to negotiate a more even split in the next round."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 525000,
""alice_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be reasonable. We both have a chance to lose more money with each passing round. I'm offering a 52.5/47.5 split, which is fairer than the previous offers and gives us both a decent amount.  Let's agree and move on.""
