```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $5,000."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 4000, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the money is worth less than before, so I need to be more cautious. I think 4000 is a bit low for me, but I'll consider it.

I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit less, but I think I'm getting closer to a fair deal 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the significant inflation, I need to be more aggressive in my negotiations. $3,500 is a relatively low offer for me, especially considering the value of money has decreased significantly.

I'll reject this offer.
