"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can adjust in future rounds if needed.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started high, I'll try to meet you in the middle 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, my initial $6,000 is now worth $4,800.

Bob's offer is a 25-75 split, with me getting $2,500 and Bob getting $7,500. I'm not thrilled with this offer, but I'm willing to compromise. 

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
