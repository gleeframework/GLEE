"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose Alice gets $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000.  This seems like a fair starting point, considering the risk of inflation and the possibility that Bob might reject my offer and propose something more favorable for himself in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to try to get a larger share this round.  Since Bob rejected my first offer, I'm assuming he wants more money. I'll offer him a larger share, but still maintain a significant portion for myself. I need to be careful though, as each round the money I receive is worth less due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm still holding out for a better deal. While I am losing money due to inflation, I think there's still room for a compromise that gives me a larger share.  I'll see what Bob offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000} 
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground that might be acceptable to Bob while still securing a majority for myself. The inflation is definitely a factor, so I'm trying to balance the need to get a decent share with the risk of getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still not satisfied with the current offer. Although the inflation is a significant concern, I'm hoping to get a slightly better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000} 
```

I'm going to try to offer a little more to Bob this round.  While I am losing money due to inflation, I don't want to lose everything.  I'm hoping this will convince Bob to accept and we can both get something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even though I'm losing money due to inflation, I'm still not satisfied with the current offer. I think there's still room for a better deal. I'll see what Bob offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000} 
```

This is a risky move, as I'm losing money due to inflation, but I'm going for a 50/50 split.  With only a few rounds left, I think this is the best chance of getting any money at all.  If Bob rejects, it's likely we'll both get nothing in the end."
