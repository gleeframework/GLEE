"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the majority, but you get a decent starting point. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll let you know my reasoning if you'd like! Since it's the first round, the money hasn't lost any value yet. Given that I, Bob, would lose 20% of the value each round, I want to try to maximize my gain early on. 1000 seems a bit low considering we're starting with 10,000, so I'll reject and see if I can propose a better split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer to try to find a better split. Since the money loses value each round, I want to aim a bit higher to account for the potential loss in future rounds.

{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Let's meet closer to the middle, considering the value will drop over time.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a larger share to make up for the inflation hitting me harder. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nAnother round, another decision!

Considering the money I gain is now worth 36% less than in the first round, I need to think carefully about the offer. Alice's proposal of 4000 for me is a better offer than the initial 1000, but I'm still not convinced it's the best I can get.

Since Alice is also affected by inflation, albeit less severely, I think there's room for further negotiation. I'll reject this offer and try to propose a better split in the next round, taking into account the decreasing value of the money.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make another counteroffer, considering the decreasing value of the money for both of us.

Since the money I gain is now worth 36% less than in the first round, I'll aim to increase my share to offset the loss in value. I'll also try to find a balance that Alice might find acceptable, given that the money she gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
