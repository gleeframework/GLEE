"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor,  keeping in mind the potential for inflation. It's a generous starting point, but I want to secure a significant portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly less favorable than my initial proposal, especially considering the inflation. I'll reject and see if I can secure a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to 70/30 in my favor. I'm willing to concede some ground to secure a deal, but I still want a sizable portion of the money. I believe this offer is fair considering the inflation and the fact that I'm now the one making the proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the inflation has significantly impacted the value of the money, Bob's offer is the closest to my desired outcome at this point.  I'll accept this offer to avoid further potential losses from inflation and secure a decent share of the money."
