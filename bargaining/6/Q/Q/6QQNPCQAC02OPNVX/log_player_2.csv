"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable. My offer is a fair counter-proposal to yours. Let's avoid further inflation and make a deal! 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the situation. While her offer is closer to a reasonable split, accepting now would still give her the lion's share. I need to push for a better deal in the next round."
