Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take a smaller share than before, but still more than you offered 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is feeling the pressure of inflation and is coming down in her demands. However, she's still asking for a significantly larger share.  It's worth holding out a little longer to see if we can get a more even split, especially since the value of the money keeps decreasing for her, not for us."

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""This is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the fairest option, especially considering the rapid inflation working against you.""}
