Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This is a very aggressive opening offer, as Alice is taking almost everything.  However, Bob has all the power in this round, so if he rejects this, he will be able to make a counter offer and Alice will face a 5% reduction in the value of the money on offer in the next round.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Alice has very little choice here. Even though it's a terrible offer, the next round will only make it worse for her, and she will lose even more. It's better to take something than nothing at all."
