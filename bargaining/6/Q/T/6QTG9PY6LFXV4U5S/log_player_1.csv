Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm proposing a 90/10 split, keeping $900,000 for myself and giving Bob $100,000.  I'm aiming for a large share since I have the first move, but I'm also being somewhat generous to avoid a long negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, taking a 45% cut is better than risking further inflation. My share would decrease even more in the next round, and there's no guarantee Bob will be willing to negotiate further."
