"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need for negotiation""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Given that Bob's offer was 55-45, I'll try to negotiate a slightly better deal for myself. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 48,
  ""bob_gain"": 52,
  ""message"": ""You offered 55, I'll meet you halfway""
}
```

I'm proposing a 48-52 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than Bob's previous offer."
