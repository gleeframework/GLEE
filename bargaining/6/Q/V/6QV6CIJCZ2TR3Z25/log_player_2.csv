Round 2

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a compromise.  It's clear we both want a larger share, but let's be practical.  Inflation is working against you. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the offer is getting closer to a reasonable split, accepting 40% now means I'm losing almost 60% of its original value due to inflation. I need to push Alice further, even if it means risking a worse offer later. There's still time, but I need to convey the urgency."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, this is it - a 50/50 split.  It's the fairest offer and the clock is ticking.  Let's end this now before inflation eats any more of our potential profit.""}"
