**Reasoning:**  We're getting close to a 50/50 split, and Alice is clearly showing a willingness to negotiate. Holding out a bit longer might result in a slightly better outcome for Bob."

Round 7

# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**  Alice is anchoring on that 56%, but we're running out of rounds.  It's time to apply a little more pressure and signal that Bob is willing to risk it all for a better deal.  There's a good chance she'll concede a bit more in the next round to avoid getting $0."
