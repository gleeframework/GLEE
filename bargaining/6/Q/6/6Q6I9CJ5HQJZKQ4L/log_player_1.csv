"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and straightforward offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I'll have to adjust my decision accordingly.

Since the money is worth 20% less for me, I'll have to think carefully about the offer. However, I don't know how the inflation affects Bob's perception of the value.

I'll reject the offer for now and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected the previous offer, it's my turn to make a new proposal. Considering the inflation, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give away all the value""
}
```

I'm trying to give Bob a slightly better deal than his previous offer, but still keeping a bit more for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit less, but I think I deserve a bigger share now 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering the significant reduction in value due to inflation, I'll have to be cautious about accepting an offer that gives me less than before. However, I also don't want to risk waiting for another offer that might be even worse.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now, hoping that it's the best I can get.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
