I propose a 900,000$ for me and 100,000$ for Bob.  I figure this is a fair starting point, as I'm taking a bit more of the initial pie but leaving Bob with something as well.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This is a far worse offer than the one I made. I would be getting only 100,000$ for 900,000$ Bob would get.  I am going to take my chances and see if I can do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 810000, ""bob_gain"": 190000} 
```

I'm going to try and push for a better deal. Considering the inflation, I'm offering 810,000$ for myself and 190,000$ for Bob.  This should be a good deal for both of us, as it still leaves a decent share for him while giving me a larger portion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 190000 
# Bob gain: 810000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a terrible deal. Even though the money I get will be worth less because of inflation, it's still a far lower share than what I'm trying to secure for myself. I'm going to try and negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 729000, ""bob_gain"": 271000}
```

I'm going to take a risk and offer a slightly smaller share for myself. This deal still leaves a decent amount for Bob, but at this point, I'm hoping he sees the value in settling before the inflation eats away at what I can get even more.  I'm offering 729,000$ for me and 271,000$ for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 271000 
# Bob gain: 729000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While this offer still gives me less than I initially hoped for, the inflation is making each round increasingly difficult for me. Accepting this offer guarantees me some money, even though it's significantly less than I originally proposed. It's better than risking further losses with another round."
