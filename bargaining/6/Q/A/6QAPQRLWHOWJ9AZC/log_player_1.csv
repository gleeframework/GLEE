"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll give you a good deal, but don't expect me to go easy on you!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. The message is a bit of a warning, but I'm trying to be friendly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting with a fair offer, Alice. Let's see if we can both get something we're happy with. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth less now!

I'm not thrilled with the offer, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not bad, but I was hoping for a bit more. I'll wait for a better offer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now! Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3000,
  ""bob_gain"": 7000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting off that easy, Bob! I'll give you a decent chunk, but don't think you're getting the better end of the deal.""
}
```"
