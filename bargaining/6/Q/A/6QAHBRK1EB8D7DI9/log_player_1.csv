"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can move on to the next round.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000, which is a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slightly more balanced offer. Let's see if you'll take it. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'll consider the offer carefully.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, my gain of $600,000 is still a significant amount. However, I'm not sure if it's the best deal I can get.

I'll reject the offer and make a counter-proposal in the next round.
