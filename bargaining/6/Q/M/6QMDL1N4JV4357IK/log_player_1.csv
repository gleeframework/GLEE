I'm going for a pretty aggressive offer in the first round, hoping to secure a large share while the inflation effect is minimal.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much worse for me than my offer in round 1, and it seems like he's trying to take advantage of the inflation. I'll reject this offer and hope for a more equitable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000} 
```

I'm going to lower my offer slightly to account for the inflation, but I'm still aiming for a significant share of the money.  It's important to remember that each round, my share will be worth less.  I'll need to find a balance between securing a decent amount and avoiding further rejections."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still not fair, and the inflation is really starting to bite into my share. I'm going to reject again and see if we can reach a more equitable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000} 
```

The inflation is really starting to hurt, and I need to compromise. I'm offering an even split now, hoping Bob sees the sense in it. If we keep rejecting each other, we'll both lose a lot more."
