"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is a fairly generous offer, giving Bob a significant portion of the money to start with. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking its toll.

I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 20% less now, I'll aim to get a bit more. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the inflation in mind, I'll aim to get a bit more this time. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"
