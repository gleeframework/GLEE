Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer.  I'm losing value faster than you, but I'm still willing to share fairly.  It's in our best interest to end this now. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in Round 3 is the most logical decision for Bob at this point. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Bob is losing value much faster than Alice with each passing round. Waiting any longer will only result in a smaller share for him, even if he could secure a slightly better split in a later round.
* **Alice's Finality:** Alice has stated this is her final offer. There's a real risk she won't budge further, forcing Bob to accept an even worse deal in a later round or walk away with nothing.
* **Reasonable Share:**  400,000 is a significant amount of money, even with the inflation. Accepting ensures Bob gets a reasonable share, rather than risking it all for a potentially slightly larger, but riskier, gain later."
