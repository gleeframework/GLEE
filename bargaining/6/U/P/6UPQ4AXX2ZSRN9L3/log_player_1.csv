"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob gets 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of my potential gain due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully. Since Bob's offer is 50-50, I'll decide to reject it.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In the next round, the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the previous round, due to inflation. Since I rejected the 50-50 offer, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the significant reduction in value of my potential gain due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about Bob's new offer. Since the money I gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my strategy. Bob's offer is still 40-60, which is still a bit better for me than my previous offer. I'll decide to accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
