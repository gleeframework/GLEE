{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but how about a 60/40 split in my favor?  The value of the money is decreasing, so I need a bit more to make it worthwhile.""}

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I'll offer you 45.  It's still less than a 60/40 split, but I think it's fair considering the inflation. Let's end this. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
