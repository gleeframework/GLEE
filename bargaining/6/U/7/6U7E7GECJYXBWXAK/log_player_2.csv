Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I'm willing to compromise a bit. Let's go with 55/45, but this time in my favor.  I think it's a fair trade considering your higher inflation rate. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}
I'll reject this offer. Although the inflation rate is taking its toll, I believe I can still get a better deal. Alice's offer is essentially the same split I offered her in the previous round, but in her favor. I'm not ready to concede that much yet. Let's see what the next round brings!"
