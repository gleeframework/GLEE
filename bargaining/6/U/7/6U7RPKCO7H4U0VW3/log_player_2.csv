Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm taking a small hit here to meet you closer to the middle.  Let's be reasonable and end this. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate, which works in my favor. While her offer is getting closer to a more even split, I believe I can push for a slightly better deal in the next round or two.  The inflation is hurting her much more than me, giving me leverage."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.73% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth 78.9% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fine. Take it or leave it.  
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer? 
model: {""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While I believe I could potentially squeeze out a slightly better deal, the risk is getting too high. Alice is clearly at her limit and further rounds significantly increase the risk of getting nothing. A 50/50 split at this point is a safe and reasonable outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is insane!  We're both losing money fast. This is a 50/50 split, take it or leave it.  This ends NOW! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is right - this is insane.  While my previous reasoning was sound, I misread her desperation.  It's clear now that she's willing to walk away with nothing.  A 50/50 split, even with the inflation, is far better than zero."
