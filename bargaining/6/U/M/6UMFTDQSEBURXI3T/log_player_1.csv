"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering to take 60% of the original $100, which is $60, and leaving Bob with 40%, or $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

The original $50 I would gain is now worth 95% of its original value, so it's actually $47.50. Bob's $50 is worth 90% of its original value, so it's actually $45.

I'm willing to accept this offer, as it's a fair split and I don't see any reason to reject it.
