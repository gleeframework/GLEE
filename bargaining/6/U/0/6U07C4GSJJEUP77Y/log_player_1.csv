"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which seems reasonable given that I'm the one making the first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Your turn to decide! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","In the second round, the money is worth less, so I need to be more cautious. I don't want to give away too much. I'll reject the offer and make a new proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Your offer is too even. I'd like a bit more for myself.""
}
```

Now it's my turn to make a new offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In the third round, the money is worth 10% less than in the second round, and Bob's gain is worth 5% less than in the second round. I'll make a new offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to keep some for myself.""
}
```

This time, I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I'm getting closer to a fair deal. Your turn to decide! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains! In the fourth round, the money is worth significantly less than in the first round. I need to be careful not to give away too much.

However, Bob's offer is actually a 45-55 split, which is a bit more favorable to him than my previous offer. I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, I'll accept your offer. I'm not getting any younger, and I don't want to play this game forever!""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer and end the game."
