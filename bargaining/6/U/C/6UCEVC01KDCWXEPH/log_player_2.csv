# Alice gain: 70

# Bob gain: 20 
# Alice gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

It's painful, but I have to cut my losses.  Alice has me over a barrel. If I reject this, we both get nothing, and at this point, 10% is better than nothing."
