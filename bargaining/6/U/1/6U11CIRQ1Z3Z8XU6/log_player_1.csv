"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, hoping Bob will accept and we can avoid any unnecessary negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but still a fair offer! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With Bob's offer, I'd get $30, which is still a decent amount, considering the inflation.

I'll accept this offer.
