"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start with!""}

I'm proposing that we divide the $10,000 equally between us, with each of us getting $5,000."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve more since I'm making the first offer. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, as I'd rather not give him a 60% share of the money. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'll propose a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer:

I'm proposing a slightly more favorable split, with me getting 55% of the $10,000 and Bob getting 45%."

# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's try to meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise and split it 50/50 again. This time, I'm willing to make the first offer.""}

I'm going back to the 50/50 split, hoping that Bob will accept this time."
