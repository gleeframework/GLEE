"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal, Bob. This offer won't be as good in future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. The current offer doesn't seem fair, and I believe we can negotiate a better split. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, Alice. This is a more reasonable split.""}\n\n###\nI'm hoping Alice will see the fairness in this offer and accept it. The inflation is a concern, so I'm trying to be reasonable while still getting a good deal. Fingers crossed!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The clock is ticking, Bob.  This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nConsidering the inflation, I think it's time to accept the offer. The value of the money is decreasing for me, and Alice's offer, although not ideal, is better than risking further devaluation. It's time to cut my losses and take the deal."
