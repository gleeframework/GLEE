Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a 90/10 split in my favor.  I figure I'll get the bulk of the money, and Bob will be happy to get anything at all.  Let's see how this plays out!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer.  Even though I'm getting less than I initially proposed, I'm still getting a decent amount of money, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all.  It's better to take what I can get now rather than hold out for a better deal and risk losing everything."
