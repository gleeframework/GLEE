6000.0,4000.0,"Let's be fair, Bob. This offer leaves us both with a good amount.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Let's try to meet in the middle. Given that the money loses value for me with each round, I believe this offer is fair and takes into account the risk I'm taking by not accepting your initial proposal.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
6200.0,3800.0,"The clock is ticking, Bob. This offer is even better for me than the last one, but I'm still being reasonable. Let's close the deal.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4200.0,5800.0,"Considering the inflation is affecting my share, I'm willing to take a bit of a risk and propose a slightly higher amount for myself. However, I still believe this offer is reasonable and gives Alice a substantial amount. Let's see if we can find common ground.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
6400.0,3600.0,"Bob, the value is slipping away for you with every round. I'm being generous, but my patience is wearing thin. Take this offer before it's too late!",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"I understand that Alice is trying to pressure me, but given the significant loss in value I'm experiencing due to inflation, I feel compelled to propose a division that somewhat compensates for this loss. This offer still gives Alice a substantial amount, and considering we're halfway through the rounds, it's time for us to seriously consider finding a middle ground that works for both of us.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
6500.0,3500.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm offering you a deal that's more than fair considering the circumstances. Accept this offer, or we both lose out!",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
3800.0,6200.0,"Given the drastic decrease in value for my share due to inflation, I'm compelled to seek a division that somewhat offsets this loss. This offer still provides Alice with a considerable amount. We're running out of time, and it's crucial we find a mutually acceptable agreement soon to avoid both of us losing out entirely. I'm hoping Alice will recognize the urgency and accept this proposal as a reasonable compromise.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
6600.0,3400.0,"Bob, the clock is about to strike midnight on this deal. I'm offering you one last chance to walk away with something. Take it or leave it!",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
3500.0,6500.0,"Given the extreme loss in value I'm facing due to inflation, I'm forced to seek a division that compensates for this loss as much as possible. This offer still gives Alice a significant amount, but I believe it's more reflective of the risk I've taken by continuing negotiations under these conditions. We're very close to the deadline, and I urge Alice to consider the very real possibility of us both ending up with nothing if we don't agree soon. I hope this proposal will be seen as a serious attempt to find a mutually acceptable solution before it's too late.",Bob,10,
