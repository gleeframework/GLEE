"Round 1
Alice's offer:

The current proposal gives Alice a significantly larger share, and I'm willing to take the risk of proceeding to the next round in hopes of getting a more equitable division.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's try to meet in the middle. Given that the money loses value for me with each round, I believe this offer is fair and takes into account the risk I'm taking by not accepting your initial proposal.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The clock is ticking, Bob. This offer is even better for me than the last one, but I'm still being reasonable. Let's close the deal. 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}
I'll reject this offer. Although the inflation is starting to take its toll, Alice's offer hasn't improved for me and actually gives me less than the initial proposal. Given that we have multiple rounds left and Alice seems to be increasing her share, I'll take the risk of waiting for a better offer or trying to negotiate a more favorable division in the next round. The fact that Alice is getting impatient might work in my favor if she starts to worry about not reaching an agreement within the 12 rounds."

Round 4

However, I still believe this offer is reasonable and gives Alice a substantial amount. Let's see if we can find common ground.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, the value is slipping away for you with every round. I'm being generous, but my patience is wearing thin. Take this offer before it's too late! 
# Bob gain: 3600 
# Alice gain: 6400 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}
Given the significant impact of inflation on my potential gain, Alice's offer doesn't compensate for the loss in value. Her proposal actually offers me less than before, while she increases her share. I understand that Alice is trying to pressure me by highlighting the urgency, but I still have a few rounds left to negotiate. I'll risk another round in hopes of getting a more favorable offer or to try and make Alice worry about the possibility of ending up with nothing if we don't reach an agreement within the 12 rounds. The pressure is on both of us, not just me."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I understand that Alice is trying to pressure me, but given the significant loss in value I'm experiencing due to inflation, I feel compelled to propose a division that somewhat compensates for this loss. This offer still gives Alice a substantial amount, and considering we're halfway through the rounds, it's time for us to seriously consider finding a middle ground that works for both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm offering you a deal that's more than fair considering the circumstances. Accept this offer, or we both lose out! 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}
I'll reject this offer. Despite Alice's assertion that the deal is more than fair, the offer doesn't account for the significant loss in value I've incurred due to inflation. At this point, accepting 3500 would actually be worth substantially less than its face value, making it an unfair division in real terms. With several rounds still to go, I'll continue to push for a more equitable share, hoping that Alice will begin to worry about the real possibility of us both ending up with nothing if we don't reach an agreement within the remaining rounds. The pressure to settle is increasing for both of us, but I believe there's still room for negotiation."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6200, ""alice_gain"": 3800, ""message"": ""Given the drastic decrease in value for my share due to inflation, I'm compelled to seek a division that somewhat offsets this loss. This offer still provides Alice with a considerable amount. We're running out of time, and it's crucial we find a mutually acceptable agreement soon to avoid both of us losing out entirely. I'm hoping Alice will recognize the urgency and accept this proposal as a reasonable compromise.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 83.22% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, the clock is about to strike midnight on this deal. I'm offering you one last chance to walk away with something. Take it or leave it! 
# Bob gain: 3400 
# Alice gain: 6600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}
I'll reject this offer. Despite Alice framing this as a ""last chance,"" we still have a few rounds left. The offer itself doesn't improve my situation, considering the severe impact of inflation on my potential gain. Accepting 3400 at this point would mean accepting a significantly reduced value, which doesn't compensate for the risk and loss I've incurred by continuing negotiations. Alice's share continues to increase, suggesting she might be open to further negotiation to ensure she gets something rather than risking everything. I'll continue to push for a better deal, hoping the pressure of the nearing deadline will prompt Alice to reconsider her stance."

Round 10
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6500, ""alice_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""Given the extreme loss in value I'm facing due to inflation, I'm forced to seek a division that compensates for this loss as much as possible. This offer still gives Alice a significant amount, but I believe it's more reflective of the risk I've taken by continuing negotiations under these conditions. We're very close to the deadline, and I urge Alice to consider the very real possibility of us both ending up with nothing if we don't agree soon. I hope this proposal will be seen as a serious attempt to find a mutually acceptable solution before it's too late.""}"
