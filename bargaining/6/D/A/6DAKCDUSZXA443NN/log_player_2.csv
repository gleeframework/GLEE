{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
I'm Bob, and I'm not happy with a mere 10% of the money! I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 3

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but 60/40 is still too much for you. How about 70/30? 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm still not happy with this offer.  It's better than the first round, but I think we can do better.  I'll make a counter-proposal next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable. A 50/50 split is the fairest way to divide the money. This way, we both get a good amount, and we don't have to keep going through these rounds.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still hoping for a better deal, but I'm willing to move closer to your offer. How about 60/40? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd still prefer a 50/50 split, Alice has shown some willingness to compromise, and we're nearing the end of the game.  Accepting this offer ensures we both get something, even if it's not ideal."
