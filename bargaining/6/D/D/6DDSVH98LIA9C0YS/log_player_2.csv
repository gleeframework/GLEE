{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Your offer was a bit too much in your favor, Alice. How about we try a 70/30 split this time?  Consider that the value of the money decreases faster for you than for me.""}

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 55/45.  This takes into account the inflation rates and allows us both to get a decent share. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
