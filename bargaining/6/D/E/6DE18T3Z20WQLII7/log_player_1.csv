"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can reassess as needed""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets 40%, which is $40. I'm hoping this is a reasonable starting point, and we can adjust as needed in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a more even split this time. I'm willing to give you a chance to make a more favorable offer next round. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly. With the current proposal, I would get $40, which is 40% of the initial $100. Considering the inflation, this is actually a relatively good deal for me.

However, I'm not thrilled about giving up 60% of the money to Bob. I think I can do better.

I'll decide to reject this offer and hope to make a better proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share, but I still think I deserve a bit more""}

I'm proposing that I get 45% of the initial $100, which is $45, and Bob gets 55%, which is $55. I'm trying to find a balance between being generous and still getting a decent share of the money. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
