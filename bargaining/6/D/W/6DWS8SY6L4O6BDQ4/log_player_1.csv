"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on! With inflation reducing the value of my gain, I need to think carefully. Since Bob is offering me 40, which is less than my initial 50, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject.

I'll reject this offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","With inflation reducing my potential gain even further, I'll have to be more aggressive in my proposal. Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 35,
  ""bob_gain"": 65
}

I'm offering Bob a larger share, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game before things get worse."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of my potential gain is decreasing rapidly due to inflation. I need to think carefully about this new offer from Bob. Since he's offering me 45, which is more than my previous offer of 35, I'll consider it a decent proposal. I'll accept this offer.
