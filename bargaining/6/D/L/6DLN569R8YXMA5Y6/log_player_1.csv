"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since I know the inflation will negatively impact me in future rounds, I'm aiming for the biggest possible share right now.  This offer is likely to be accepted by Bob as getting $1 is better than potentially getting nothing in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'm losing a lot of potential gains due to inflation, accepting this offer is still better than potentially getting nothing in future rounds. With each passing round, the value of the money decreases, and there's no guarantee Bob will make a better offer."
