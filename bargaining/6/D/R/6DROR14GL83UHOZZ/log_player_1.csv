"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $40, which is a relatively fair offer considering the game's conditions. Since the money's value decreases by 5% for Bob each round, it's in his interest to accept a reasonable offer early on. My message aims to convey a sense of fairness while also taking into account the strategic aspect of the game.\n\n###\n\nPlease respond with Bob's decision. Will he accept the offer or proceed to the next round?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it closer to the middle this time. I'm willing to give you a little more. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, considering the inflation, the value of the money remains the same for me but decreases for Bob. This means that with each passing round, I can potentially get a better deal as Bob is incentivized to settle sooner due to the devaluing of his share. Bob's offer of $45 for me is less than my initial proposal, and given the conditions, I believe I can negotiate for more in subsequent rounds.\n\n###\n\nPlease proceed with the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, this is a good deal for you.""}\n\nIn this round, I'm offering Bob $42, which is slightly less than my initial offer but still reasonable considering the game's progression. The message aims to remind Bob of the inflation's impact on his potential gains, suggesting that accepting this offer would be advantageous for him before the value of his share decreases further.\n\n###\n\nPlease respond with Bob's decision on whether to accept this offer or proceed to the next round."
