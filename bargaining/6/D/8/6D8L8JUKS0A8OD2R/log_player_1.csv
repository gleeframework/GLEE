"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you a decent amount to keep you interested.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself, which is a 60-40 split. This is a relatively generous offer, and I hope Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly better deal. How about we split it 50/50? 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation has already taken its toll! My gain is worth 10% less than before.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about the 50/50 split, but I'm willing to compromise. However, I'd like to propose a slight adjustment to make it more appealing to me. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I like the 50/50 idea, but I'd like to give myself a slight edge. How about we split it 55/45 in my favor?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation has reduced the value of the money again! My gain is worth 10% less than in the previous round.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up all the negotiating power. Take it or leave it.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much. I think this is a fair compromise. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll! My gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about the 52-48 split, but I'm willing to accept it since it's a relatively fair compromise. I'd rather take what I can get at this point and move on to the next round. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
