Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bit more 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58

Round 4

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a bit more than last time, but I'm not going to 50/50 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is slightly better, the inflation is eating into Bob's potential gains at an alarming rate.  It's worth taking a risk and hoping Alice will offer a better deal in the next round rather than accepting an increasingly bad deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""Time is running out, and inflation is hurting us both. This offer is a compromise to ensure we both walk away with something.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The relentless march of inflation is killing Bob. He needs to accept a deal soon, or he risks getting nothing. While not ideal, Alice's offer is better than what she offered in Round 5, and the potential gains for Bob continue to shrink with each passing round. It's a gamble to hope for a better deal in the remaining rounds."
