**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting this offer is becoming the more rational choice. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The longer the game continues, the less the money is worth to both of us, but especially to Bob due to his higher inflation rate. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** Alice is incrementally increasing her offer to Bob. Holding out for a much better deal is increasingly risky, as Alice is unlikely to make a drastic jump.
* **Time Pressure:** With only 7 rounds left, the pressure to make a deal is mounting. The risk of walking away with nothing is very real if we don't reach an agreement soon.

It's frustrating to accept less than 50%, but the devaluation makes this offer the most sensible given the circumstances."
