"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, hoping to set a good tone for the negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation taking effect, my $5000 from the first round is now worth less.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not sure if I should accept it. I'd rather try to negotiate for a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and looking forward to making a counteroffer in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation taking effect, my $4000 from the second round is now worth even less.

Here's my counteroffer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you halfway between our previous offers. Consider this a compromise!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still aiming to get a slightly larger share to compensate for the inflation."
