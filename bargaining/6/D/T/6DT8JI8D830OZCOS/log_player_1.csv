"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose to take 999,999 dollars and give Bob 1 dollar.  I figure this is a fair starting point.  Let's see what he thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer. I'd rather play another round and see what Bob offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm willing to give Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still aiming for the majority. Let's see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Although I'd prefer more, Bob's offer is now pretty good for me, and he's likely to only become more demanding in the next round. It's better to take what I can get."
