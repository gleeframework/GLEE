Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be more equitable this time.  I'm willing to share more, but I think a more even split is fairer. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
