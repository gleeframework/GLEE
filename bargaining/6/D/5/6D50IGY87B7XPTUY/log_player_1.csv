{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $5000. This seems like a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer. He's proposing a 60/40 split, which means I'd get $4000 and he'd get $6000. While his message says it's a ""slight lean towards me"", I think I can do better. I'd like to make a counteroffer and try to get a more even split."

I'm proposing a 45/55 split, with me getting $4500 and Bob getting $5500. I'm trying to be a bit more generous than his original offer, but I still think I'm being reasonable. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"

Ugh, Bob's offer is getting worse! He's proposing a 35/65 split, with me getting $3500 and him getting $6500. I'm not happy about this at all. I think I can do better, especially considering the money is worth less than it was in the first round due to inflation. I'd like to make another counteroffer and try to get a more even split."
