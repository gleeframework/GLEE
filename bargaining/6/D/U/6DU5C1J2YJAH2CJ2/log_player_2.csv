"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we split the $1000000 evenly. This ensures fairness and mutual benefit. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

It's risky to accept an even split right away.  Since the money is worth less each round, it makes more sense to see if I can get a slightly better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  Since we're playing with inflation, it's important to secure a larger share early on.  I'm confident this is a fair deal for both of us.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, I propose a 60/40 split in your favor. This maintains a balance while accounting for the decreasing value of money over time. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
The inflation is hurting me, and Alice's offer, while not ideal, is still a gain compared to the previous round.  I'm willing to accept this to avoid the risk of getting a worse deal in the future."
