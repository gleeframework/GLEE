"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
```

This offer is designed to be fair while maximizing my share. It gives Bob a small amount to potentially incentivize him to accept, but I retain the majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is enticing, it's important to consider the inflation factor.  My gain is worth 5% less than the previous round, while Bob's gain is worth 20% less. Rejecting this offer gives me the opportunity to make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
``` 

This offer is a compromise.  I reduce my share from the first round while still maintaining a significant portion.  The inflation factor is less dramatic now, and this offer seems like a good starting point for negotiation."
