"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This way, I get the majority of the money, but still offer Bob a decent amount."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation taking effect, I'll have to be more cautious. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

```

I'm not satisfied with the offer, I want a bit more."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With the inflation taking its toll, I'll have to be more aggressive in my next offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm taking a slightly riskier approach, but I think I can get a better deal this time."

# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is eating away at the value of the money! I'll have to be more careful with my next decision. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think I can live with this offer, considering the value of the money is decreasing rapidly."
