"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Alice, the total amount is now 800,000$ (1,000,000 * 0.8) for me, but I'll still consider the original 1,000,000$ in my calculations.

I'll offer: 
{""bob_gain"": 750000, ""alice_gain"": 250000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 36% less for me and 19% less for Alice, the total amount is now 640,000$ (1,000,000 * 0.8 * 0.8) for me, but I'll still consider the original 1,000,000$ in my calculations.

I'll compare the offer to the original 1,000,000$. If I accept this offer, I'll get 500,000$ which is 50% of the original amount, and Alice will get the other 50%. This seems reasonable, so I'll accept.
