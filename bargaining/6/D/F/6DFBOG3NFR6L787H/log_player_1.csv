"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 51:49 split in my favor.  It's a more equitable split, given that the money is worth less for you in each round. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","{
