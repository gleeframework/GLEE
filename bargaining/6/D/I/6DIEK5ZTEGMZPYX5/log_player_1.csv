Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split fairly. I get 60, you get 40. Inflation is coming, so don't wait!

# Bob gain: 60

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I know inflation is eating away at my share, but I'm not desperate yet! Let's meet in the middle - 55 for me, 45 for you. It's a fair deal considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is feeling the pressure of inflation, but there's still room for negotiation. While his offer is closer to a reasonable split, I believe I can get a better deal in the next round.  Bob's share will be worth even less then, making him more likely to accept a lower offer."
