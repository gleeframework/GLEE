"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, let's be realistic! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I need to adjust my thinking.

Since Bob's offer is for 4000 for me, but it's worth 5% less than the original 5000, it's equivalent to 4750 in the original terms. And Bob's 6000 is worth 20% less, making it equivalent to 4800 in the original terms.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, as it seems a bit unfair considering the original split was 50/50. I'll reject this offer.

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth less with each round, I'll aim for a higher share to compensate for the decrease in value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit less, but I think this is a fair compromise!""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable offer, considering the decreasing value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting greedy, I'm being fair! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the equivalent values in the original terms:

My gain of 4500 is worth 14.26% less than the original 5000, making it equivalent to 4291 in the original terms. Bob's gain of 5500 is worth 48.8% less than the original 6000, making it equivalent to 3084 in the original terms.

This offer is even less favorable to me than the previous one, considering the inflation effect. I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, but I'll think about it...

After reconsidering, I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the significant inflation effect, I'll aim for an even higher share to compensate for the decrease in value. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise!""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable offer, considering the rapidly decreasing value of the money."
