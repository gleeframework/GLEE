Bob is being incredibly stubborn, but I'm still holding firm. I've lost a significant amount of value due to inflation, but I'm not going to settle for anything less than a fair share. We only have a few rounds left, so I need to stand my ground."

This is it. I'm offering an equal split. With only a few rounds left, the inflation is taking a major toll.  I'm hoping Bob finally recognizes that we both need to compromise to get anything at all."
