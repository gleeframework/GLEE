  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate!""

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, as it's a fair and simple division. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject this offer."

# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

  ""message"": ""I'm still not satisfied with the gap between our shares. I'll wait for a more even split.""

  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""I'll take the 70/30 split. It's a decent offer, and I'm not willing to risk waiting for another round.""
