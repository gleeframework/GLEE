Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're getting close to the end, Alice. Let's find a compromise that secures a decent share for both of us. I'm willing to reduce my share a bit more, but we need to act now before the inflation hits us harder.

# Bob gain: 650000

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 6 is the most logical decision at this point. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:** The value of the money is decreasing significantly with each round for Alice. Waiting longer means a drastically smaller potential gain, even if she gets a larger percentage in a later round. 
* **Bob's Concessions:** Bob has shown a willingness to compromise, slightly lowering his demand from the previous rounds. 
* **Time Pressure:** With only 6 rounds remaining, the risk of walking away with nothing significantly increases if Alice continues to reject offers. 

This acceptance secures Alice a reasonable sum, even considering the inflation, and avoids the risk of completely losing out as the game progresses."
