I'm starting with a 60/40 split in my favor, hoping to secure a good portion of the money early on. I'll need to keep in mind that Bob's money loses value faster, so I'll have to be mindful of that in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob's offer is slightly better than mine, but I can likely get a better deal. I'll see what I can negotiate in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5750, ""bob_gain"": 4250}
```

I'm offering a slightly higher split for Alice, taking advantage of the fact that Bob's money is losing value faster. This is still a favorable deal for me, considering inflation.  I'm hoping this offer will be enough to secure a deal before the money becomes even less valuable."
