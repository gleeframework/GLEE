"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good deal! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Your turn Alice.  I'm feeling generous, but let's wrap this up quickly.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Sensitivity:**  The money loses value for me with each round. It's in my best interest to reach a deal quickly.
* **Fairness with Urgency:**  While I'm willing to accept slightly less than a 50/50 split in Round 1, I'm aiming for a more advantageous outcome in Round 2. This offer is still reasonably fair to Alice, encouraging her to accept.
* **Direct Communication:** The message aims for a balance between firmness and encouragement to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You were generous, I'll be generous too. Let's meet in the middle! 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Inflation:** The money is losing value quickly. A 4200 dollar gain now is significantly less than what it was in Round 1, and it'll be even worse in Round 4. 
* **Better Than Expected:** Alice's offer is more generous than her initial 60-40 proposition. Meeting in the middle after I made a reasonable counter-offer is a decent outcome considering the time pressure. 
* **Risk of Further Losses:**  Rejecting this offer risks Alice becoming less generous in future rounds, leading to even greater losses for me due to inflation."
