"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the initial amount, and Bob gets 40%."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less, I'd rather get a larger share now to compensate for the loss in value. I reject this offer.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a higher share this time. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000

```

This way, I get 70% of the current value of the money."

# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 48.8% less than the original amount, I'd like to get a larger share to compensate for the loss in value. I think 500,000 is a reasonable offer, but I can do better. I reject this offer.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the significant inflation, I'll aim for a larger share this time. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money. Considering the significant drop in value, I think 300,000 is a relatively small amount, but I'll accept it to avoid further erosion of the money's value.
