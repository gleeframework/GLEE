"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a decent amount, don't be greedy!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor, with me getting $700,000 and Bob getting $300,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think we can find a more balanced split.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get a fair share. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, my gain of $450,000 is worth 95% of the original $700,000 I proposed, which is $665,000, and Bob's gain of $550,000 is worth 90% of the original $300,000, which is $495,000.

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, considering the initial offer I made was already a 70-30 split. However, I'm willing to compromise.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
