"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is better. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so I need to adjust my expectations accordingly.

I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept an even split just yet. I'll wait for a better offer. Your turn, Bob!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and the fact that Bob's offer was 55-45, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think?""
}
```

This time, I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which is a slight improvement for me. Your turn, Bob!"
