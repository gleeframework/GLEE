"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 

I'm going for a relatively fair initial offer, aiming to secure a decent chunk of the money while leaving Bob with something to potentially accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

This is a very unfair offer, and while I'm losing money each round, I'm not losing it at nearly the rate Bob is.  I can likely get a much better deal if I reject and propose in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm going to increase my offer slightly, hoping to find a compromise that Bob might be willing to accept. I'm still prioritizing a good share for myself, but I'm willing to give up a bit more to avoid a potential stalemate later on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a better offer for me than the last one, but it's still not a fair deal. I'm losing value much slower than Bob, and I can likely get a better deal in the next round if I reject."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm increasing my offer again, aiming to find a middle ground. The inflation is starting to hurt Bob much more than me, so I'm hoping this offer is tempting enough for him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting better, but I'm still losing value at a much slower rate than him. With only 6 rounds left, I need to try and get a more equitable deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm making a final attempt to find a compromise. With the inflation hitting Bob harder, I'm hoping this offer is appealing enough for him to accept, ensuring we both get something before the value of the money diminishes too much further."
