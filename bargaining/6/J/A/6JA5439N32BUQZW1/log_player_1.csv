"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
I propose a 9000/1000 split, giving me the majority of the money.  This is a fair offer, as I'm taking the risk of being rejected and having to negotiate further.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share,  accepting this offer ensures I get at least something. With inflation, each round I risk losing more of my potential gains. A 50/50 split is a fair compromise given the circumstances."
