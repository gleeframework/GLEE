9000.0,1000.0,Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and you get 10%.  We can negotiate more in the next rounds if you want.,Alice,1,

5000.0,5000.0,"You said start fair, so let's start fair. 50/50 for now.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
6000.0,4000.0,"I appreciate your attempt at fairness. Let's compromise. I'll take 60% and you get 40%.  This gives you a better share than before, and it's still a good deal for me.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
3000.0,7000.0,I'm not going to accept a deal that leaves me with 40% when I could have 50% earlier. I'll try to get a better deal this time.,Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Let's be realistic here.  Inflation is eating away at our gains.  I'm willing to take a smaller share this time, but I need to get something out of this.  I propose 4500 for me and 5500 for you. This ensures we both get something, and we can avoid a worse outcome later.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"I'm not convinced that 45% is a good deal for me. I'll try to get a better share, but I'm open to negotiations.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
3500.0,6500.0,"We're running out of time. If we don't reach an agreement soon, inflation will eat away at all our gains. I'm willing to accept 3500 for myself, which is a significant reduction from what I initially asked for, but I need to secure something. Let's end this now.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
2500.0,7500.0,"I'm not going to accept a deal that leaves me with a smaller share than I had in previous offers. I'm willing to take a risk and try to get a better deal, but I need to be careful with the time running out.",Bob,8,
