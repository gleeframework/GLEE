"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

I'm offering you 30% of the original 100$."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, the actual amounts would be:

* Alice gain: 50 * 0.8 = 40
* Bob gain: 50 * 0.8 = 40

I accept this offer.
