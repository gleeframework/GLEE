"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a slightly unfair offer in my favor, hoping Bob will accept.  I'll be watching the inflation and adjusting my strategy as the game progresses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a much fairer offer, and while I lose out on some potential gains, it's better to secure something than risk getting nothing due to the inflation."
