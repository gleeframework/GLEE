"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I propose I take $70 and you take $30. This seems fair to me considering the inflation rates we are dealing with. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Alice, your offer was heavily skewed in your favor. Let's be reasonable, I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  This accounts for the fact that I face a higher inflation rate.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but your offer is still not reasonable to me. I'm willing to compromise, so I propose a 65/35 split.  Let's close this deal and avoid further losses from inflation. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
