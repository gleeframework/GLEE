"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 90-10, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 90-10 split, offering Bob a relatively small portion to see how he reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 95-5 split is a fairer start. Let's see what you think. 
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 5% inflation, my gain of $50,000 is now worth $47,500.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about the 95-5 split, but I'll have to weigh the risks of rejecting it and going to the next round. I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 5% less than in the previous round, so I'll aim for a slightly higher share to compensate.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more this round, but I'm still thinking 7-3 is a reasonable split.""
}
```

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
