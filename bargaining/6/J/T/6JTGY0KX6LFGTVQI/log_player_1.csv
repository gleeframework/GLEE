Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'll need to adjust my thinking accordingly. I'll also consider that Bob's gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, but I don't know the exact value of the money he gains.

After considering the offers, I decide to:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me only $4,000, especially since the money is worth less than it was initially. I'd like to negotiate further to get a better deal."
