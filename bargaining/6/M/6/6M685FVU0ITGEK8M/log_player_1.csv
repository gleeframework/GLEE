"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI'll start by offering a division that slightly favors me, taking into account that the money loses value over rounds, but still aiming to be somewhat fair to encourage Bob to accept early and minimize loss due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer because, considering the inflation, accepting 5000 in the second round is actually worth less than what I would have gotten in the first round. Since I started with a higher offer for myself and Bob rejected it, I believe there's room for a better compromise that takes into account the decreasing value of money over rounds. I'm aiming to maximize my gain while still being mindful of the need to reach an agreement before the money becomes worthless."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll adjust my offer slightly, taking into account the inflation and the fact that Bob was willing to accept an even split in the previous round. Since the money's value decreases more for me than for Bob over rounds, I have an incentive to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. However, I still want to maximize my gain, considering Bob's willingness to compromise.\n{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's compromise a bit more.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is hitting you harder than me, Alice. This is my counter-offer. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll reject this offer because, even though Bob has made a counteroffer that acknowledges the impact of inflation, accepting 4800 in the fourth round is significantly less valuable than what I initially proposed or could potentially get if we continue negotiations. Given the increasing impact of inflation, especially on my share, I want to push for a better deal that reflects a more equitable distribution considering the time value of money. I'll aim to find a middle ground that could satisfy both of us before the money loses too much value.\n{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll adjust my offer again, taking into account the increasing impact of inflation and Bob's last counteroffer. Since the gap between the value loss for me and Bob is widening, I'm more inclined to reach an agreement sooner. However, I still believe there's room for negotiation to maximize my gain while being mindful of Bob's perspective.\n{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Meeting in the middle considering inflation.""}"
