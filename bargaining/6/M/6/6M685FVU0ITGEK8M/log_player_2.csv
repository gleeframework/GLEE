Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, let's compromise a bit more. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to a more even split, it's still beneficial for me to hold out a bit longer.  The impact of inflation is becoming more significant for Alice, which might push her to make a better offer in the next round."

Round 4

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meeting in the middle considering inflation. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is finally agreeing to an even split. While it's tempting to push for more, the impact of inflation is significant at this point. Accepting this offer guarantees I get a reasonable share, whereas continuing to negotiate could lead to a worse outcome for both of us as the money loses value."
