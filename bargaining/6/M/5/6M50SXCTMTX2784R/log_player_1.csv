"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, giving Bob a significant portion of the money. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is essentially the same as mine in the first round, but with the inflation adjustment, my gain is now worth 10% less. I'll have to think carefully about this...

I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob's offer was essentially the same as mine in the first round, but with the inflation adjustment, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This offer gives me a slightly larger share of the money, but still leaves Bob with a significant portion. I'm hoping he'll accept this time."
