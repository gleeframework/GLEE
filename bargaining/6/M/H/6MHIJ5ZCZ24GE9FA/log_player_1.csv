"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. My message is a friendly one, suggesting that this is a fair and reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's compromise, I'll give you a bit less 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

Considering the new offer, I'll have to think carefully. Since the money is worth 10% less now, I'll have to adjust my expectations accordingly.

I'll reject this offer for now. I'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's make a deal""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42-58 split, which is closer to the original 60-40 split I suggested in round 1, but with a bit more compromise. My message is a friendly one, suggesting that we meet in the middle and make a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not giving up 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll now!

Considering the new offer, I'll think carefully about it. Since the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my expectations even further.

I'll reject this offer for now. I'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4800,
  ""bob_gain"": 5200,
  ""message"": ""Last chance, let's finalize the deal""
}
```

I'm proposing a 48-52 split, which is a bit more in my favor, but still relatively close to the middle. My message is a bit more urgent, suggesting that this is my final offer and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
