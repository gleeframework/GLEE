Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's switch roles. I believe a 70/30 split is fairer for the initial round. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try this again. I'm willing to go back to a 65/35 split, but we need to come to an agreement soon. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly trying to exploit the inflation to his advantage. He's hoping I'll panic as the rounds go on and accept a worse deal.  While the gap is closing, I'm still aiming for a better than 65/35 split in my favor."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Bob, we're running out of time. This offer is generous considering the time pressure and inflation. Let's close this deal.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm lowering my ask slightly to show some flexibility, but still aiming for a significantly larger share.  The ""time pressure"" angle is introduced to make Bob more aware of the shrinking pot."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we need to be more realistic with our demands. This is my final offer before we both risk losing everything. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough one. Bob is clearly trying to pressure me, and his offer is now closer to my previous one. However, accepting now would mean settling for less than my initial offer after the inflation.  I'm willing to gamble one more round that Bob's desire to get something is stronger than his desire to squeeze me further."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is a real compromise. It addresses the time constraint and gives us both something. Don't let this opportunity slip away.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm significantly lowering my demand to show Bob I'm serious about reaching a deal. The split is now much closer to even, reflecting the pressure of the dwindling rounds.  The message emphasizes the ""last chance"" aspect without explicitly making a ""final offer"". This keeps the door open for a counter-offer, but conveys the urgency."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting very close to the deadline. Let's meet in the middle with a 55/45 split. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob has finally moved past the initial offers and is now agreeing to a split where I get more than him.  While it's not ideal, the inflation is eating into the pot significantly. Accepting now guarantees a reasonable payout, whereas continuing the game carries the risk of getting nothing at all if we fail to agree."
