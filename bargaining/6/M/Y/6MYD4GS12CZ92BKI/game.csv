55.0,45.0,"Alice, your offer was a bit too greedy for me. Let's be fair: I take $45, and you get $55. It's a much better deal for me considering the inflation, and it still leaves you with a good chunk.",Bob,2,

60.0,40.0,"Alice, I'm seeing you're still not serious about finding a compromise.  I'll come down a little bit: $40 for me, $60 for you. This is my final offer, take it or leave it.",Bob,4,
