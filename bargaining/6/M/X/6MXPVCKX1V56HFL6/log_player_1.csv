"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, no need to negotiate too hard""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this straightforward offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm still keeping a majority 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. With the money being worth less each round, I want to maximize my gain.

I'll decide to reject this offer for now. I'd rather try to negotiate further to get a better deal.

```

```

I'm trying to find a sweet spot where I'm getting a decent share, but also giving Bob a reasonable offer to try to end the game. The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, so I need to act soon!"
