"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. I'm proposing a 50/50 split. We both get a decent amount, and we don't have to worry about inflation eating away at our money. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
