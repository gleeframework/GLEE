"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5}
``` 
 
I propose keeping the majority of the money, as I am the first to make an offer. This should incentivize Bob to accept in order to get something rather than risk getting nothing in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I accept Bob's offer. While I'm getting less than I proposed, I'd rather get 80% of the diminished value than risk getting nothing at all in later rounds."
