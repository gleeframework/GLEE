"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

This offer is designed to give me a large share of the money while still giving Bob something to potentially accept, especially considering there are many rounds left and the money will lose value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a good deal for me.  Even with the inflation, I'm getting a significant share of the money, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in the future."
