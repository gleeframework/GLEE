"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, I get a bit more 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 525000,
""alice_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""I think we should aim for a more balanced split this time. This offer accounts for the time value of money.""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Gain:**  I've increased Bob's share to $525,000.
* **Alice's Gain:** Alice's share is now $475,000.
* **Message:** The message emphasizes fairness and acknowledges the decreasing value of the money for Bob as rounds progress. This subtly puts pressure on Alice to accept a deal sooner rather than later."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, my share should be higher 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is using the inflation against me, and her offer is getting worse. It's clear she's aiming to exploit the situation. It's risky, but I need to push for a better deal while there's still time."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""This is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the fairest option. Accept this now, or we both risk losing out.""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Gain:** Offering a 50/50 split.
* **Alice's Gain:**  A 50/50 split.
* **Message:**  The message is firm and establishes a sense of urgency. This puts the pressure back on Alice. By framing it as a loss for both of them if she declines, I'm hoping she'll see the value in a guaranteed win.

**Reasoning:**

It's a risky move, but I need to stand firm. Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation situation. By offering a 50/50 split, I'm making it clear that I'm not willing to be exploited.  The message emphasizes that there's a real chance we both walk away with nothing if she continues to play hardball."
