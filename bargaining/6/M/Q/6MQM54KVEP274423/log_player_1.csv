"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. Accept and we're done!""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time, Alice.  It's the fairest way to go. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, my gain of 50 is actually $45 in real terms.

I'll consider Bob's offer, but I'm not sure if I want to accept it. I'd like to make a counteroffer.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not quite even, Bob. I'll think of something better.""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 10% less than in the previous round, my gain of 45 is actually $40.25 in real terms.

Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, Bob. Accept and we can wrap this up.""
}"
