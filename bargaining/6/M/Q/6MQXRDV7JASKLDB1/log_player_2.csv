"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This split will benefit both of us. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think this is a fair split, considering the inflation.  We both get a decent amount.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. This offer is my final one. The value is decreasing rapidly for both of us, especially you. Take the deal before it's too late. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though the offer is a bit worse than my previous proposal, it's still better than the decreasing value of the money.  It's better to take what I can get before the value drops even further."
