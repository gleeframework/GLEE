Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a very generous offer to Bob. This is meant to try and secure a quick agreement and avoid the diminishing value of the money as the rounds progress."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than his previous one, it's still far below what I consider fair. I'm confident I can do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

I'm raising my offer to Bob slightly, hoping to incentivize him to accept.  This offer is still very fair considering the inflation rates, and I'm confident it will be accepted."
