"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's divide the money fairly. I propose we split it 3:1 in favor of Bob. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is generous, I want to see if I can get a better deal.  There are still many rounds left, and with inflation kicking in, I want to maximize my gains.  Let's see what Alice offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 900000,
""alice_gain"": 100000,
""message"": ""I'm feeling a bit greedy today.  This is my final offer. Take it or leave it.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I believe in fairness. Let's split the money equally. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
With the inflation taking a toll, I am willing to settle for an even split. It's a good deal considering the risks of further rounds."
