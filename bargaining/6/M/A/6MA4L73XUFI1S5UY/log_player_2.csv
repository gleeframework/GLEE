"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I'll take the lion's share, but you get a decent piece. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible deal for me!  Alice's offer may sound ""fair"" now, but the inflation heavily favors me in later rounds. I need to hold out for a much better share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I'm feeling generous, Alice. Take it or watch your share shrink!"" 
}
``` 

This offer is heavily skewed in my favor, but that's the point.  Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:**  Alice is feeling the pressure of inflation much more than I am. Each round she waits, her potential share decreases dramatically.
* **Establishing Dominance:** This offer makes it clear I'm not settling for a small amount. It sets the tone for future negotiations. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  Even if Alice rejects this offer, it gives us a starting point for negotiation. She might counter with something more reasonable in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time. It's getting risky for both of us! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a good time to take the deal. Here's why:

* **Fairness:** A 50/50 split is objectively fair, even though I was aiming for more. 
* **Increasing Risk:**  While I lose less than Alice to inflation each round, the losses are still significant. Waiting any longer is getting too risky. 
* **Alice is Getting Serious:** Her offer and message suggest she understands the urgency of the situation.  She's unlikely to offer me a much better deal than this."
