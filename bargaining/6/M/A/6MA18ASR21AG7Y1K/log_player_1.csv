"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
```

I'm going to propose a split of $9,000 for me and $1,000 for Bob.  This seems like a fair starting point, as it gives me the majority of the money while still giving Bob something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob is proposing a complete reversal of our initial offer, which is unreasonable. I'm going to reject this offer and see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer slightly, but still keep the majority of the money. I believe this is a fair offer, considering the inflation and the fact that Bob rejected my first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still trying to push for a reverse of our initial offer, even though inflation has hit me much harder than him.  I'm going to reject this offer and continue to fight for a fairer split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer again, but this time I'm offering a more even split to see if I can reach a compromise with Bob. Inflation is taking a significant toll, and I need to find a way to secure a decent share of the money before it's worth too little."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation, and his offer is still too lopsided.  I need to keep pushing for a better deal before I'm left with almost nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split.  Inflation is rapidly decreasing the value of the money, and I need to find a solution that secures at least some reasonable value for myself.  A 50/50 split feels fair in the face of this rapidly changing situation."
