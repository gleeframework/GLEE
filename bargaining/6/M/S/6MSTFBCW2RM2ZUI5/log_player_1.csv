"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to negotiate if you want more!""
}
```

I'm proposing that we split the money 60-40 in my favor, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting too high, I can do better than that! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

I'm not sure if I'm willing to give up that much, but I don't want to risk going to the next round either. I'll accept Bob's offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
