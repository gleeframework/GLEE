"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm offering to split the $10,000 evenly between us, with each of us getting $5,000. This is a straightforward and fair proposal, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You rejected 50/50, now I'll take a bit more! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, I'll have to consider the new values.

If I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $4,000, which is worth 80% of the original $5,000 I was offered in the first round.

I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with Bob taking a larger share, but I also don't want to risk going to the next round with even lower values.

I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take the lead, but I'm still willing to share!""
