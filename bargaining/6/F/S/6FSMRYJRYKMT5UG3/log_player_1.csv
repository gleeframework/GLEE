"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I think this is a good starting point.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $100, leaving Bob with $20."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair compromise, considering the initial offer was quite skewed towards you. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of 40$ is actually worth 36$ (since it's 10% less than the 40$ I would have gained in the first round).

I think Bob's offer is a good compromise, and I'm willing to accept it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
