"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm offering you $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7500 
# Bob gain: 2500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll consider the new values.

For me, $7,500 is worth 0.9 * $8,000 = $7,200, and $2,500 is worth 0.8 * $2,000 = $1,600.

I'll accept this offer.
