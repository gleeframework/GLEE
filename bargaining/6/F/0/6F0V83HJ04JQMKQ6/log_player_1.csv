"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll give you $100,000 and take the rest. You can't do better than that!""
}
```

I'm making a strong opening offer, taking 90% of the initial $1,000,000 and leaving Bob with $100,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You think $100,000 is a good starting point? I'll do better than that! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob thinks he can do better!

Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, I'll calculate my potential gain in the current round:

* My gain: 300,000
* Inflation-adjusted gain: 300,000 / 0.9 = 333,333.33

Considering this, I'll respond:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Now it's my turn again. Considering the inflation has reduced the value of the money, I'll aim to get a better deal. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""You think $700,000 is a good offer? I'll give you $580,000 and take the rest. It's a fair deal!""
}
```

I'm increasing my proposed gain to 42% of the remaining $1,000,000, leaving Bob with $580,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I can tell. I'll give you a slightly better deal than before, but don't think you're getting away that easily! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is sticking to his guns!

Let's calculate the inflation-adjusted values for my potential gain in the current round:

* Initial gain: 400,000
* Inflation-adjusted gain: 400,000 / 0.727 (since 100% - 27.1% = 72.9% = 0.729, but I used 0.727 to be more conservative) = 550,275.35

Considering this, I'll respond:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","It's my turn again. Given the increasing inflation, I'll aim to get an even better deal. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""You think $600,000 is a good deal? I'll give you $550,000 and take the rest. It's getting close to the end, but I'm not giving in yet!""
}
```

I'm increasing my proposed gain to 45% of the remaining $1,000,000, leaving Bob with $550,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're running out of money, Alice. I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to let you have all the fun. 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to squeeze the last bit of value out of me!

Let's calculate the inflation-adjusted values for my potential gain in the current round:

* Initial gain: 250,000
* Inflation-adjusted gain: 250,000 / 0.5965 (since 100% - 40.95% = 59.05% = 0.5905, but I used 0.5965 to be more conservative) = 420,177.51

Considering this, I'll respond:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","It's my turn again. Given the increasing inflation, I'll aim to get a better deal. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 300000,
  ""bob_gain"": 700000,
  ""message"": ""You think $750,000 is a good deal? I'll give you $700,000 and take the rest. It's getting desperate, but I'm not giving in yet!""
}
```

I'm increasing my proposed gain to 30% of the remaining $1,000,000, leaving Bob with $700,000."
