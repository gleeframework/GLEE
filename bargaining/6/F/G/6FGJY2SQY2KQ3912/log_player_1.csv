"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm starting with a generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a quick agreement and avoid the risk of inflation diminishing our gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject Bob's offer. While he's offering a larger share to me now, it's still much less than what I initially proposed. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share this round, hoping to leverage the inflation affecting him more than me. I'm still aiming for a larger share while being reasonable to avoid further rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I accept Bob's offer. While it's significantly less than what I initially proposed, the inflation is quickly reducing the value of the money, and accepting this offer guarantees me something rather than risking getting nothing."
