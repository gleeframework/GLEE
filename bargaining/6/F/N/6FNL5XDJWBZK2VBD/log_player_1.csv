"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my offer for Round 1:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```
This is a generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it quickly so we can start enjoying our respective gains!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll have to be more careful with my decision.

I'll reject this offer. The 300,000 I'd gain is not enough to justify accepting, considering the reduced value of money.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In Round 3, the money is worth 40% less than in the first round. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}
```
This offer takes into account the reduced value of money and aims to give Bob a slightly larger share to try to persuade him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'll have to be cautious with my decision.

I'll accept this offer. 450,000 is a decent amount, and it's better than risking going into further rounds and potentially getting less.
