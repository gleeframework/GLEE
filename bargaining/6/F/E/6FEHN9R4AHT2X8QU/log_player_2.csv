"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take a bit more this time! 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""How about we meet in the middle? This seems fair.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting impatient... 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation working against me. While the offer is getting worse, I need to hold out for a better deal. It's a risky game, but accepting such a low amount now will leave me with significantly less value."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Okay, let's be real.  50/50 is the fairest and we both lose if this fails. Deal?""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  It's time to make a strong stand and propose a genuinely fair deal. A 50/50 split is the most logical solution. This conveys seriousness while still aiming for a beneficial outcome for both of us.  Alice might be trying to exploit the inflation, but the longer this goes on, the more we both stand to lose."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You should have taken my previous offer... 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** This is getting dangerous, but Alice is clearly trying to pressure me. Accepting this offer would mean losing a significant chunk of the potential gain, even more so with the inflation. I need to hold my ground a little longer and hope she starts negotiating realistically."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""message"": ""This is getting us nowhere. I'm willing to take a slightly smaller piece, but this needs to end. Do you agree?""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  

Time is running out, and I need to signal a willingness to compromise.  Offering Alice slightly more while still securing a reasonable amount for myself seems like the best course of action. Emphasizing the need for a resolution might push Alice to accept. We are both losing out the longer this goes on."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time... 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**  This is brutal, but I can't accept this offer. Alice is clearly taking advantage of the situation, but with only three rounds left, I need to gamble that she'll start negotiating more fairly. Accepting now would mean a huge loss compared to what I could have gained, even with the inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""This is my final offer. Let's be reasonable and end this now, or we both walk away with nothing.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's desperation time.  I'm mirroring Alice's offer from Round 1, which was already generous to her.  This shows I'm serious about ending the game and willing to compromise, but not to the point of getting completely ripped off.  The ""final offer"" angle adds pressure, as does reminding her that continued stubbornness helps no one."
