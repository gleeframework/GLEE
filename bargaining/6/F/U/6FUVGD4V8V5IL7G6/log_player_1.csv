"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose a 60/40 split, with me receiving $6,000 and Bob receiving $4,000.  This seems like a fair starting point, given the inflation rates we'll face in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred my initial offer, a 50/50 split is still a fair outcome given the inflation rates. Accepting this offer ensures that we both receive a significant portion of the money."
