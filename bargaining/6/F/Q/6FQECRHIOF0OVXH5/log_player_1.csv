Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we need to find a compromise. This is my final offer - let's end this now and both benefit. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

This is a tough one, but I'll explain my reasoning. Bob is clearly trying to push me to the edge, knowing the inflation is hurting my potential gains. However, accepting 450,000 now is a significant loss compared to what I could have gotten earlier.  

I'm betting Bob is bluffing about this being his final offer. He wants to avoid walking away with nothing as much as I do. I need to show strength and try to get him closer to a 50/50 split."

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous. A 50/50 split is the only fair option. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob has finally moved to a 50/50 split. While I could gamble that he'd fold and give me an even better deal in the later rounds, the risk is too high.  With each round, the inflation makes a significant dent in my potential gains. Accepting the 500,000 now is the safest option to ensure I walk away with a substantial amount."
