"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 55/45, it's a better deal than your 60/40 and the money will be worth less in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While his offer is slightly better than a straight 50/50 split after the second round of inflation, I believe I can get a better deal if I'm the one proposing in round 3."
