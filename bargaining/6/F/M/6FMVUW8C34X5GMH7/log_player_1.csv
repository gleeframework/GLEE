"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount, and I'm willing to compromise to get the game started. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting that Bob wants to be more aggressive in the second round!

I'll consider the proposal, but I'd like to get a bit more for myself. Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer, considering the effects of inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a new proposal, taking into account the effects of inflation. Since the money is worth 0% less for me, but 10% less for Bob (5% less in the first round, and another 5% less in the second round), I'll aim to get a slightly larger share. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to get a larger share as the game progresses.

However, I'm not willing to give up that much more. I'll consider the proposal, but I'd like to get a bit more for myself. Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer, considering the effects of inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a new proposal, taking into account the effects of inflation. Since the money is worth 0% less for me, but 19.26% less for Bob (5% less in the first round, 5% less in the second round, and 9.26% less in the third round), I'll aim to get an even larger share. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5800,
  ""bob_gain"": 4200
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
