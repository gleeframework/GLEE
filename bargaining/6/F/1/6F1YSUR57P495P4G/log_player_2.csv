"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While Alice's offer seems generous, it's important to remember that the money will be worth less in the next round, especially for Alice. By rejecting, Bob has a chance to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's split it more evenly this time, considering the value of the money will decrease for both of us in the next round.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take a bit less than before, but still more than half 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is still generous, and while the money is worth less now, it's better to secure a deal than to risk getting nothing at all.  It's also likely that Alice's offers will become less and less generous as the rounds continue, making this a good opportunity to secure a decent amount."
