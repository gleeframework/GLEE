Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want this money. I've adjusted my offer slightly, but time is running out for you. Let's make a deal now before inflation eats away at your potential gain. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000

""alice_gain"": 550000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer.  You need to consider how much the inflation is hurting you.  Let's close this out now and both get something. 
# Bob gain: 375000 
# Alice gain: 625000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, the effects of inflation are becoming severe. While Alice's offer isn't ideal, consider these points:

* **Shrinking Pie:**  My potential gains are diminishing rapidly each round. Taking a smaller share now might be better than risking an even smaller share (or nothing) later.
* **Alice's Stance:** Her message implies this is her final offer, meaning she's unlikely to budge further.
* **Certainty vs. Risk:** Accepting guarantees me something. Rejecting risks getting a much worse deal or even nothing if I miscalculate.

It's a tough choice, but the risk of getting a significantly worse outcome outweighs the potential for a slightly better one at this stage.
