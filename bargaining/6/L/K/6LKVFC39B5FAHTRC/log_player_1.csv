Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair and reasonable start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial 100$ and Bob gets 40%. This is a fair and reasonable starting point, and I hope Bob will accept it!"

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bigger share, but not that big! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'll consider it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I was hoping for a better deal, and 30% is a bit too low for me. I'll reject this offer and hope to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more!""}

I'm increasing my proposed share to 75%, hoping that Bob will be willing to compromise and meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you most of it, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of! 
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is biting!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'll think carefully about it.

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm accepting this offer because 80% is a decent share, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a smaller share later on. Plus, Bob is giving me a relatively generous offer, so I'll take it."
