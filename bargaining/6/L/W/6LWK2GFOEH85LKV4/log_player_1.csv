"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 975000,
""bob_gain"": 25000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is my initial offer. Let's settle this quickly and avoid losses from inflation.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This offer heavily favors Alice, but it's strategically sound for the first round. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:**  The longer the game goes, the less the money is worth to Bob due to his 5% inflation rate. This creates pressure for him to accept a reasonable deal sooner rather than later.
* **Anchoring Bias:** By starting with a high offer for herself, Alice sets a benchmark. Even if Bob rejects this offer, it might make him view subsequent offers that are slightly more in his favor as more acceptable.
* **Quick Resolution:** A quick resolution is ideal for Alice as she faces no inflation. 

This offer is unlikely to be accepted, but it's a strong opening move to set the stage for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle and avoid further losses from inflation. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is phrased as ""meeting in the middle,"" it's not a truly equal split considering the impact of inflation. 

* **Inflation Still Hurts Bob:** Even with this offer, Bob's 5% inflation means he's losing value. He's incentivized to make a deal quickly.
* **Alice is at an Advantage:** Alice experiences no inflation, so time is on her side.  There's no need to rush into an agreement that doesn't favor her more.

By rejecting this offer, Alice signals that she's aware of the inflation dynamic and aims for a more advantageous split."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 825000,
""bob_gain"": 175000,
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you want to meet in the middle, but we need to factor in the inflation. This offer gives you a significant amount while recognizing the decreasing value over time.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  Alice is moving closer to a more balanced split, but not drastically. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining an advantageous position.
* **Highlighting Inflation:** The message directly addresses the inflation issue again, reminding Bob of the pressure he's under. 
* **Future Leverage:** By making this offer, Alice sets a new reference point. If Bob rejects it, Alice will be in a stronger position to propose an even less generous offer in the next round, knowing that Bob's potential gains are shrinking.

This offer aims to strike a balance between enticing Bob with a reasonable sum and maximizing Alice's gain while considering the dynamics of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the significant impact of inflation, I think this offer is a fair compromise. Let's settle this before it's too late! 
# Alice gain: 650000 
# Bob gain: 350000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is feeling the heat from inflation and his sense of urgency is clear in his message. However, Alice is still in a strong position:

* **Inflation Advantage:**  Bob's 14.26% loss translates to a significant psychological pressure.  He's now losing more than twice the value he would have in the previous round.
* **Holding Steady:** Alice's previous offer was already a significant concession.  Bob's counter-offer doesn't warrant an immediate acceptance. It indicates a willingness to move closer to Alice's desired range.
* **Final Round Leverage:** If Bob follows a pattern, his next offer will likely be even closer to Alice's desired outcome as the impact of inflation intensifies.  

By rejecting this offer, Alice maintains her strong position going into what could be a final round of negotiation."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 750000,
""bob_gain"": 250000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is my final offer. It's crucial we settle now. This accounts for the inflation impact, giving you a fair share while ensuring we both benefit from this deal.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a strategic final offer with a sense of urgency:

* **Finality:** Calling it a ""final offer"" increases the pressure on Bob. It signals that Alice is unwilling to negotiate further.
* **Concession and Firmness:** Alice makes another concession by moving closer to a 75/25 split. This shows flexibility while still maintaining a strong position. 
* **Inflation Emphasis:** The message reiterates the impact of inflation, reminding Bob that time is running out for a favorable deal.

This offer aims to secure a significant portion of the money for Alice, capitalizing on the pressure Bob faces due to inflation while still offering him a reasonable share to encourage a deal."
