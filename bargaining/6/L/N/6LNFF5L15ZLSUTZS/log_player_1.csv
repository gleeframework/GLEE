 I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor. I figure I should get the lion's share since I'm the one making the first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
 
 I'll accept. Although inflation has eroded some of my gains, I'm still getting a significant amount of money. It's better to take what I can get now than risk losing even more in future rounds."
