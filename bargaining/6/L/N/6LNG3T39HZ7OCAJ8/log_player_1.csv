"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate, let's end the game here!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take this for now 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants to take a bit more for himself. I'll have to think carefully about this.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll have to consider the value of the money I'll gain in the future rounds. If I accept this offer, I'll be left with $4000, which is still a decent amount. On the other hand, if I reject this offer, I might get a better deal in the next round.

I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's now my turn to make a new proposal. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but not too much. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly better deal for Bob, but still keeping the majority of the money for myself. Let's see if he'll accept this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more, but not too much, let's see if you'll give it to me 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is still trying to get a better deal. With inflation taking a bigger hit on his share, I'll have to consider the long-term value of the money.

I'll have to weigh the benefits of accepting this offer, which would leave me with $4500, against the potential for a better deal in future rounds. Since my share is worth the same as in the first round, I'll have to think carefully about whether to accept this offer.

However, considering the decreasing value of Bob's share due to inflation, I'll decide to accept this offer.
