Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to compromise, but a 70/30 split is still too far off. Let's try a 60/40 split this time. It's more fair, and we can both walk away with a significant sum.

# Alice gain: 600000
