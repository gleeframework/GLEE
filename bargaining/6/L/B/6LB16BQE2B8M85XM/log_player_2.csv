"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair.  I'll take the lion's share, but you get a decent chunk.  Accept, and we can both be rich.  Reject, and we'll see what happens next. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I appreciate your generosity, but I think we can both do better.  Let's be more equitable.  I propose a 55/45 split in my favor.  This will ensure we both have a significant share, and we can end this game now.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting greedy, Bob.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, but this is my final offer.  Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is less than my previous proposal, accepting it secures a significant gain and avoids further potential losses due to inflation. The remaining rounds could lead to a further decrease in my share, making this offer the most favorable option."
