I'm going to start with a pretty generous offer to Bob.  I'm hoping he'll accept, but if he doesn't, we'll see what happens with inflation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to keep more, it's unlikely I'll get a better deal in the next round.  There's a chance Bob might try to get even more in the next round, and I don't want to risk losing even more money!"
