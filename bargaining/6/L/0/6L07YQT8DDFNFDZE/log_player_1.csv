"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
 
I propose a 9000/1000 split, favoring myself slightly as I'm the one making the offer. This leaves room for negotiation in future rounds, but hopefully secures a good chunk of the money for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred a larger share, accepting Bob's offer means getting 5000 dollars, which is better than nothing.  Given the inflation and the fact that Bob could have proposed an even less favorable split, I'll take it."
