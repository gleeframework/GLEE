"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point""}

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a bit more 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not satisfied with Bob's offer. I was hoping for a more substantial gain, especially considering the inflation. I'll wait for the next round and try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think I deserve a bigger share""}

I'm proposing that I get $75 and Bob gets $25."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting desperate, but I still want a fair share 
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm starting to get a bit worried about the inflation, and Bob's offer is getting closer to my previous one. I think this is a good compromise, and I'm willing to accept $20 for myself. It's not ideal, but it's better than going into further rounds and risking even more value loss due to inflation."
