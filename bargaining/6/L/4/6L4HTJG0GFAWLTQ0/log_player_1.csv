"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 80% and you take 20%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split, which I think is a fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly. This way we both get a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a toll on my gains!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully. With the money being worth 5% less than before, $5000 is equivalent to $4,762.50 in the previous round's value.

I'm not sure if I want to accept a 50-50 split, considering the value of the money is decreasing. However, it's a fair offer, and I don't want to be too greedy.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation taking its toll, I'll have to adjust my offer. Since the money is worth 5% less than the previous round, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the decrease in value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'll take a larger share to maintain my purchasing power. Let's see if you're willing to accept this compromise.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a larger share to avoid further rounds and the potential for even less for both of us. Let's settle this now. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a bite out of my gains! With the money being worth 14.26% less than the first round, $4000 is equivalent to $3,444.40 in the original value.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not sure if I want to accept a 40-60 split, especially since it's not much better than the 42.86-57.14 split I would get if we were splitting the money evenly. However, I'm getting a bit desperate to end this and get some value out of the deal.
