"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 650000,
""bob_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Let's be fair, Bob. This offer ensures we both benefit.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Understanding the Game:** The key element here is the asymmetric inflation.  My money loses value rapidly with each round, while Bob's remains stable. This puts a time pressure on me to secure a deal.
* **Round 1 Offer:** I'm starting with a somewhat generous offer to Bob. This approach aims to:
    * **Signal Fairness:** It shows I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial outcome. 
    * **Encourage Acceptance:** Bob might be tempted to accept now rather than risk a less favorable deal later as the value of my future offers decreases for me.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer Alice, but I believe a more balanced split is in order. Let's make this work. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly worse for me. While his message sounds conciliatory, he's clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage. Here's why I reject:

* **Unfavorable Shift:** Bob increased his share substantially while decreasing mine. Accepting now would lock me into a much worse outcome than my initial offer.
* **Leverage Still Exists:** I still have some leverage. While the money loses value for me each round, Bob doesn't gain any benefit from waiting. The pressure is still on both of us to reach an agreement. 

I need to counter with an offer that maintains a reasonable balance while acknowledging the impact of the inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Bob, time is important here, and we both lose if we drag this out. I'm making a fair offer considering the circumstances.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:**  I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share than my initial offer but less than he demanded. This acknowledges the time pressure while still striving for a reasonable outcome.
* **Clear Communication:** My message directly addresses the urgency of the situation.  I'm not hiding the inflation factor; I'm using it as a point for finding a mutually beneficial agreement quickly. 
* **Maintaining Firmness:**  While I'm willing to concede a bit, I'm not giving in to Bob's attempt to take a much larger share. This offer reinforces my position that a fair deal is crucial.

Let's see how Bob responds to this counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close. I'm aiming for a slightly better outcome for myself while still ensuring you receive a significant portion. Let's settle this now. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:** The inflation is severely cutting into my potential gains. While Bob's offer isn't ideal, accepting now gives me  $475,000. Rejecting this means I risk getting even less in the next round.
* **Bob's Stance:**  Bob seems unlikely to move much further in my favor.  His message suggests this is his ""final offer"" and he's counting on me feeling the pressure of the shrinking pot.
* **Cutting Losses:**  While I started with a goal of a larger share, the game's mechanics are working against me. Accepting now avoids the risk of ending up with a much smaller amount if I continue to reject Bob's offers."
