"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice's offer is very generous to herself, especially considering the inflation. While it might seem tempting to take $40 now, I have a good chance of securing a better deal in later rounds as the money becomes less valuable to Alice faster."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I'm feeling generous, but let's speed things up. Take it or leave it.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Counter:** I'm countering Alice's initial offer with a significant shift in our favor. This establishes that I'm not going to be easily swayed. 
* **Time Pressure:** By introducing the ""take it or leave it"" element, I'm creating a sense of urgency. This might make Alice more inclined to accept a less favorable deal now than risk further devaluation.
* **Future Leverage:** If Alice rejects this offer, I'm still in a good position. As time passes, the value decreases faster for Alice, giving me more negotiating power."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me halfway, it's better for both of us 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Favors Alice:** While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, this offer still slightly favors her, especially considering the faster rate of inflation on her end.
* **Inflation Advantage:** The money is losing value quickly, primarily for Alice. I can leverage this by continuing to wait for her to make more desperate offers.
* **Mid-Game Strategy:** We are not critically low on rounds yet. Holding out for a better offer in the next couple of rounds is a calculated risk worth taking."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""This is my final offer. The clock is ticking, Alice.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Shifting the Balance:** I'm proposing a split that is slightly in my favor, reflecting the increasing pressure on Alice due to the inflation rate. 
* **Creating Urgency:**  The message explicitly states this is my ""final offer,"" increasing the perceived risk for Alice if she declines.
* **Calculated Risk:**  We're getting into the later rounds, so it's a gamble. However, with the rapid devaluation for Alice, there's a good chance she'll see this as her best opportunity for a reasonable payout."
