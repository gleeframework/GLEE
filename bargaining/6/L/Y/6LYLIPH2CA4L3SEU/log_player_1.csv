Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than an even split.  I'll take $7000 and you can have $3000.  This way, we both get something, and it's still a fair deal considering the decreasing value of the money. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000
