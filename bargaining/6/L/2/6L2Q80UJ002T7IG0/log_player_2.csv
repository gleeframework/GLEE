"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, I'll take the majority but it's still a decent share for you 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While it's tempting to take the $3000, rejecting allows me to make the next proposal and potentially get a better deal, especially since Alice's money is losing value faster than mine."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I think this split is more fair, considering the money is losing value faster for you. Let's end this now and both get a good share.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share, but I still think I deserve more due to the initial majority I proposed 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, the money is losing value rapidly for both of us.  Accepting Alice's offer guarantees a decent gain for me, and the further rounds risk losing even more value."
