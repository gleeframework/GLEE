"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a fair offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

This way, we both get an equal share of the $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making a decision. Considering the inflation, Bob's offer is actually quite generous to me, given that the money I gain is worth 5% less, while Bob's gain is worth 10% less. I'll accept his offer.

```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```"
