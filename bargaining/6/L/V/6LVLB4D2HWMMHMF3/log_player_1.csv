"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""I propose we divide the money with a 3:1 ratio in favor of my gain. This seems fair considering the potential risk of inflation.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 2:1 ratio is more reasonable, considering the uncertainty of inflation. I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share to ensure a fair outcome. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
