"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the money into two equal parts. This ensures fairness and prevents any potential conflict over the distribution. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

This is a classic game theory problem.  While Alice's offer seems fair, it's in Bob's best interest to reject and see what Alice offers in the next round.  The inflation means that Bob's share will increase with each rejected offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 950000,
  ""alice_gain"": 50000,
  ""message"": ""Let's be realistic. I'll take the lion's share, but you still get a decent cut.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the rejection of my previous offer, I propose a new division where we split the money more equally. This maintains fairness while also increasing your portion. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Alice's offer is better than her previous one, Bob should still reject.  He's in a better position to negotiate and knows that the longer this goes on, the more Alice will be under pressure to accept a less favorable deal due to the inflation factor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 900000,
  ""alice_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Time is running out. My offer is final. Take it or leave it.""
