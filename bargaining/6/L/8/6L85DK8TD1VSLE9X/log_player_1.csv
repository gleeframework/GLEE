"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering a 60/40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject my proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bigger share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Thanks for the update on the offer.

I'm not too thrilled about the 30% gain for me, but I suppose it's better than nothing. Considering the inflation, my effective gain would be $63 (70 * 0.9), which is still a decent amount.

I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 2.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
