"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I believe this division is fair and gives us both a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not accepting this offer as I believe I can get a better deal in the next rounds. With the inflation rate, Alice loses more value than I do, so I'm hoping to use this to my advantage in the negotiations. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a bit more than half, considering the inflation rate affects you more. This way, we both still get a significant amount, but I'm taking into account the future value of the money.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your point about the inflation difference, but your offer was too far in your favor. This is a more balanced proposal considering the future value for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm rejecting this offer because, despite the inflation adjustments, Alice's proposal still doesn't meet my expectations. Given the increasing devaluation of the money, especially for Alice, I believe I can negotiate for a larger share in the next rounds. The gap in the inflation impact between us gives me leverage to push for a better deal. On to the next round!"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Given the significant impact of inflation on your share, I'm adjusting my proposal to reflect this. My new offer still allows you to walk away with a substantial amount, but it also acknowledges the decreasing value of the money, particularly on your end. I believe this division is more in line with the current state of our negotiations.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time and the money is losing value quickly. I'm sticking to a split that leans more towards me to compensate for the inflation disparity, but this is a compromise to get us both a decent outcome. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm rejecting this offer because, despite the urgency and the impact of inflation, Alice's proposal doesn't sufficiently adjust for the rapidly decreasing value of her share. Given that we are halfway through the rounds and the money's value is dropping significantly, especially for Alice, I believe I can push for a better deal. The pressure of the rounds ending and the substantial loss in value for Alice gives me the leverage to aim for a more favorable split. On to the next round!###"

I'm adjusting my offer to reflect this reality. Given the significant loss in value on your end, I believe this split is more reasonable and acknowledges the urgency of the situation.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm offering you a larger share than you'd get if we split evenly after the next round of inflation.  Take the deal now before we both lose out even more. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm rejecting this offer because, despite Alice's warning about the decreasing value of the money, her proposal still doesn't adequately account for the massive loss in value she's facing. With the current inflation rates, her share is worth significantly less than mine, and I believe I can negotiate for an even larger share in the next rounds. The threat of losing out more is real, but I'm willing to take that risk to push for a better deal, considering the substantial disparity in the value of our shares. On to the next round!###"

Given the current state of inflation, I'm making a final push for a larger share. This offer still gives you a chance to walk away with something, but it's time for us to acknowledge the reality of the situation. The value disparity between our shares is too great to ignore, and I believe this split reflects that.""}"

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 83.22% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is it.  We're both getting hurt now. I'm taking a significant hit with this offer, acknowledging the inflation disparity, but it's the best I can do.  Let's end this before we get nothing. 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm rejecting this offer because, despite Alice's acknowledgment of the inflation disparity, her proposal still doesn't meet my expectations. With the value of the money dropping drastically, especially for Alice, I believe I can make one final push for an even better deal. The risk of getting nothing is high, but I'm willing to take that chance to maximize my gain, considering the significant loss in value Alice is facing. On to the next round!###"

Round 10

I'm making one last offer, taking into account the extreme inflation disparity. This is my best and final proposal, and I believe it's the most realistic split considering the circumstances.

# Bob gain: 6500 
# Alice gain: 3500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI'm accepting this offer because, despite my previous aggressive negotiations, Alice's proposal is reasonable considering the extreme inflation disparity and the risk of walking away with nothing. At this point, the value of the money is significantly reduced for both of us, and I believe this split is a fair compromise. I've pushed for a better deal throughout the game, but now it's time to be pragmatic and accept a reasonable offer rather than risking a zero outcome. Let's end the game with a deal!###"
