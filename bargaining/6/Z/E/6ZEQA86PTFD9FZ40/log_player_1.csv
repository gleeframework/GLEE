"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need for further negotiations!""
}
```

I'm offering to split the $1,000,000 equally between us, with each of us getting $500,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this straightforward proposal and we can end the game here!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a good chunk, but I think I deserve more for my negotiation skills 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, so I'd be getting $400,000.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about getting only $300,000, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept this offer.
