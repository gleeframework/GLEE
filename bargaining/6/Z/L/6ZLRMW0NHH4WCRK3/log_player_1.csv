This is a high-risk, high-reward strategy. I'm offering Bob a very small share in hopes of getting him to accept quickly, avoiding potential inflation.  I'm also leaving a small margin for myself to make a higher offer in future rounds if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best option. With inflation, my potential gains in future rounds are significantly reduced.  It's better to secure a decent share now than risk getting nothing at all."
