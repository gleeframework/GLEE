"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and let's end this game early!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000, which is a relatively small amount, but it's a decent gesture to get the game started. My message is a bit cheeky, but I'm hoping Bob will see the value in ending the game quickly."
