Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a very slight advantage for myself, but leaving Bob with a tiny bit so he might be inclined to accept.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer means I get a guaranteed $1000, and it's much better than risking getting nothing if we keep going."
