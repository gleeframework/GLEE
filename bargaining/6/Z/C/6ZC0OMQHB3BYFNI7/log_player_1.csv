"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair!""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $400,000 and keep $600,000 for myself. I'll attach a message saying ""Let's be fair!"" to try to persuade Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a more fair distribution. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer because I think I can get a better deal in the next round. Since the money is worth 10% less for me and only 5% less for Bob, I'm more motivated to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. However, I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives Bob more than half of the money. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll offer Bob $450,000 and keep $550,000 for myself. I'll attach a message saying ""Meet me in the middle!"" to try to persuade Bob to accept the offer. Since the money is worth 10% less for me in each round, I'm willing to compromise a bit more to reach an agreement sooner.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle!""}\n\nLet's see if Bob accepts this offer!"
