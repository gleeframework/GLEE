"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose to keep 900,000 and give Bob 100,000. It's a fair starting point, and I'm confident Bob will see the value of getting something rather than waiting and risking nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer is the best choice for me. The inflation has already reduced the value of the money, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the next round.  It's better to secure at least half of the money now."
