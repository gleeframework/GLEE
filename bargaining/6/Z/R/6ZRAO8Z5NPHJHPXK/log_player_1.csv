Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not going to give you more than half.  Let's make a deal. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently offering slightly more than half to himself and seems unwilling to budge much.  While the value of my potential earnings is decreasing, it's still worth holding out for a better offer for at least a couple more rounds. Bob might be more willing to compromise when he sees I'm serious about not accepting an unfair deal."
