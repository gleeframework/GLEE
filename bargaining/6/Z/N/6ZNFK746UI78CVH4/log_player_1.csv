Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fairer, considering the inflation rate will impact you more significantly than me. Let's see if we can find a compromise.

# Bob gain: 5500
