"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 
I propose Alice gets $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000. This is a fair starting point, as it accounts for my initial desire for a larger share."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer. While I understand Bob is trying to secure a larger share due to the inflation, the proposed distribution is too skewed in his favor. It's not fair to me, especially considering my initial offer was reasonable. I will try to negotiate a more balanced split in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
``` 
I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. While I acknowledge the inflation affecting both of us, I believe a more balanced distribution is necessary to ensure a fair outcome. This offer reflects a compromise considering Bob's previous proposal, but it also maintains a reasonable share for me."

{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to a more balanced split, it's still not acceptable.  I understand the impact of inflation, but this proposal doesn't reflect the significant loss in value I've experienced. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need a better deal to accept."
