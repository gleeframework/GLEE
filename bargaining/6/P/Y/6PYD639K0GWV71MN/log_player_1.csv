"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose to keep $95 for myself and give $5 to Bob. This seems like a fair starting point, as I'm taking a larger share, but still giving Bob something to consider.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred a larger share, accepting this offer ensures I get something.  With each passing round, the value of the money decreases, making the potential gains smaller. It's better to take what I can get now rather than risk getting nothing in later rounds."
