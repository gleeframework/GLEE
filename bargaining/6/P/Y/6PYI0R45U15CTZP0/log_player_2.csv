"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money 700000 for me and 300000 for you. It's a fair deal considering the first round. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's a good starting point, but I'm hoping for a better deal. Let's see what Alice offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I'm willing to split the money 60/40, with me getting 600,000.  It's still a fair deal, and we can move on to more important things.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation and previous offers, I propose we split it 600000 for me and 400000 for you. Let's aim for mutual benefit here. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred a higher percentage, accepting this offer is the best option. The inflation has already devalued my potential gains significantly, and  it's likely Alice will offer even less in the next round."
