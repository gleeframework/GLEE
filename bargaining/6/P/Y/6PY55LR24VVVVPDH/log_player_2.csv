"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being fair, but I want the majority of the money.  Let's get this over with. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer was quite bold. Let's be more realistic.  I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  Think carefully, time is money, and it's depreciating fast for both of us.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's try this again.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger share to make this worthwhile for me.  Let's not let our money disappear. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, the rate of inflation is working against us quickly. It's better to hold out for a better offer in the next round, aiming for a more favorable outcome."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, we need to find a solution quickly. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. It's a reasonable compromise considering the time pressure and the fact that the money is losing value with every passing round."" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency:** Time is running out, and every round sees a significant decrease in the value of the money.  
* **Compromise:** While I'm aiming for a larger share,  the 55/45 split shows Alice I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Inflation Factor:**  Alice's share is impacted by inflation more significantly than mine. By round 4, she's losing value at a much faster rate. This offer might look more appealing considering the circumstances."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting tired of this back and forth.  Let's meet in the middle.  A 60/40 split is the best we can do at this point.  Time is running out. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  We are now past the halfway point, and the value of the money is decreasing rapidly.
* **Favorable Split:** Alice has finally conceded to a 60/40 split, which is the same offer I made earlier. While it's not the 55/45 I was hoping for,  it's better to secure this deal now before inflation erodes its value further. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a slightly better deal in the remaining rounds is too risky. If Alice doesn't agree, we risk walking away with nothing. 
 
It's better to take the sure win now than gamble on an uncertain future."
