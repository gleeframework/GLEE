Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting increasingly desperate due to the higher inflation impacting her share. While her offer isn't great for Bob, it's likely she'll be forced to offer even more in the next round to avoid losing a significant chunk of her potential gains."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4300,
""alice_gain"": 5700,
""message"": ""This is my final offer, Alice. Take it before inflation eats away even more of your share!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

This is a strategic play on Alice's desperation due to the higher inflation affecting her. Here's why:

* **Leveraging Fear:** Alice is clearly concerned about the shrinking value of her potential gain. Bob's message directly targets this fear, pressuring her to accept.
* **Slight Improvement:** This offer is slightly better than her previous one, giving her a small incentive to accept.
* **Finality:** By stating it's his final offer, Bob creates a sense of urgency and limits further negotiation attempts.

While not ideal for Bob in a fair scenario, this offer maximizes his chances of securing a larger share given the circumstances."
