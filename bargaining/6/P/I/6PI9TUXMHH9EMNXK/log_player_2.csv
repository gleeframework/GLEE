**Reasoning:**

Alice is severely undervaluing the impact of inflation on her own gains. While her offer is slightly better than her last, it's still heavily skewed in her favor when considering the rapidly decreasing value of the money.  We need to push her closer to a more realistic split before we run out of rounds."
