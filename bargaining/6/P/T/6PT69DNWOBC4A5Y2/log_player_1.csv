"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. I'm hoping this will be a reasonable starting point for negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair split is a good starting point, but I think I can do better. Your turn to respond! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll consider the offer in terms of the original value.

Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, but since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll calculate the actual value of the offer in the first round's currency:

$5,000 (Alice's gain) is equivalent to $5,000 / 0.95 = $5,263 in the first round's currency
$5,000 (Bob's gain) is equivalent to $5,000 / 0.95 = $5,263 in the first round's currency

In the first round's currency, Bob's offer is a 52.63-47.37 split, which is closer to a 50-50 split than my original offer. However, I'm not sure if I should accept it, as I was hoping to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less again due to inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get a bit more to make it worth my while.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, hoping that Bob will see the value in meeting me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to give up too much more. I think we're getting close, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while. Your turn to respond! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 14.26% less due to inflation, I'll calculate the actual value of the offer in the first round's currency:

$4,500 (Alice's gain) is equivalent to $4,500 / 0.8554 = $5,244 in the first round's currency
$5,500 (Bob's gain) is equivalent to $5,500 / 0.8554 = $6,435 in the first round's currency

In the first round's currency, Bob's offer is a 44.73-55.27 split, which is not favorable to me. Considering the decreasing value of the money, I'm not willing to accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less again due to inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you at a 50-50 split, but I'm not sure how much longer I can afford to give up more.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping that Bob will accept this fair offer and we can finally settle on a division of the money."
