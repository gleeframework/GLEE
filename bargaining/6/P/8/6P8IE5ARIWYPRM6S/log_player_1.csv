"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need for negotiations""
}
```

I'm proposing a fair split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less for me now, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

After considering it, I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer for Round 3. Since the money is worth 10% less for me now (5% less than the previous round), I'll aim to get a bit more.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I still think 45 is a fair share""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I think 35 is a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is taking a toll on my share!

Considering the significant drop in value of my potential gain, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

After weighing my options, I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 4.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now, so I'll have to be even more careful with my offer.

Considering the current state of the economy, I'll aim for a slightly higher share to compensate for the inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 42,
  ""bob_gain"": 58,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I think 42 is the best I can do""
