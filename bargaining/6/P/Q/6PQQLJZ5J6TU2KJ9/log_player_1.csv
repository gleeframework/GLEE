"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

This is a 50/50 split, which seems fair to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is quite lopsided. I'd rather wait for a more even split. I reject his offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, my offer for round 3 is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}
```

This time, I'm offering a slightly more uneven split, taking into account the reduced value of money for me due to inflation."
