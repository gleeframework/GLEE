"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and reasonable, Bob. This is a generous offer considering the inflation rate affects you more than me. Accept and we both walk away happy. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's split this evenly. 50/50 is the fairest way to go, and avoids any further losses due to inflation.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you want to split evenly, but considering the inflation affects you more, I'm taking a bit more. This is still a good deal for you, as the next rounds will only decrease your share's value. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to use the inflation against me, but her offer is getting worse.  It's better to hold out and propose a more reasonable split, as accepting this offer would set a bad precedent for future rounds."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 480000,
""alice_gain"": 520000,

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Each round, your share loses value, and mine doesn't. I'm adjusting my offer accordingly. You should consider accepting before your share drops further. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly taking advantage of the situation, and her offer is becoming increasingly unreasonable.  While my share is losing value, accepting this low offer would set a terrible precedent for future rounds. It's highly likely she'll be forced to offer a better deal as we approach the final rounds."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 460000,
""alice_gain"": 540000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said your last offer was your final concession, but I'm not buying it. With each round, your share loses more value. I'm willing to take that into account and make an offer that reflects the reality of the situation. Accept this and we can both walk away. 
# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is bluffing. She knows I'm feeling the pressure of the decreasing value, but her offer is still  terrible. She needs to make a significant move towards a more balanced split, or I'm willing to risk it all.  We're getting close to the point where she'll be forced to make a better deal to avoid getting nothing."

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of leverage, Bob. Each round, your share loses more value. I'm not afraid to walk away empty-handed, but I'm giving you one more chance to accept a reasonable offer. Don't let your stubbornness cost you everything. 
# Bob gain: 360000 
# Alice gain: 640000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough one, but I have to stick to my guns. Alice is clearly trying to scare me into accepting a bad deal.  She's bluffing about being willing to walk away with nothing. With only a few rounds left, she'll be forced to offer something much closer to even. I'm betting on her fear of losing everything outweighing her greed."

Round 10
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 440000,
""alice_gain"": 560000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. We're both risking it all for nothing. Let's be adults and split this fairly. My offer is more than generous considering the circumstances.  Don't be foolish.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 10.

Round 11
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.13% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're right, this is getting ridiculous. But I'm not the one who's being foolish. You're the one who's refusing to accept the reality of the situation. Your share is worth less with each passing round, and I'm not going to give away my advantage. Accept this offer, or we'll both lose everything. 
# Bob gain: 340000 
# Alice gain: 660000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is it. The end game. Alice is right, my leverage is almost gone. While this offer is far from ideal, it's better than walking away with nothing. The difference in value due to inflation is too significant to ignore now. Accepting this is the least bad option at this point."
