,,,Bob,1,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Alice, let's split this evenly. 50/50 is the fairest way to go, and avoids any further losses due to inflation.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
580000.0,420000.0,"I understand you want to split evenly, but considering the inflation affects you more, I'm taking a bit more. This is still a good deal for you, as the next rounds will only decrease your share's value.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
520000.0,480000.0,"Alice, I'm willing to be flexible, but your demands are too high. This offer acknowledges the inflation impact while still being fair. Let's close this deal and avoid further losses.",Bob,4,

600000.0,400000.0,"Each round, your share loses value, and mine doesn't. I'm adjusting my offer accordingly. You should consider accepting before your share drops further.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
540000.0,460000.0,"Alice, this offer is my final concession. It's clear you understand the impact of inflation, but you're pushing too far. Let's be realistic and end this now before we both lose out.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
620000.0,380000.0,"You said your last offer was your final concession, but I'm not buying it. With each round, your share loses more value. I'm willing to take that into account and make an offer that reflects the reality of the situation. Accept this and we can both walk away.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Alice, this is it. I'm standing firm.  You're playing a dangerous game, and we're running out of time.  Take this offer, or let's both walk away empty-handed.",Bob,8,

640000.0,360000.0,"You're running out of leverage, Bob. Each round, your share loses more value. I'm not afraid to walk away empty-handed, but I'm giving you one more chance to accept a reasonable offer. Don't let your stubbornness cost you everything.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
560000.0,440000.0,"Alice, this is getting ridiculous. We're both risking it all for nothing. Let's be adults and split this fairly. My offer is more than generous considering the circumstances.  Don't be foolish.",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
660000.0,340000.0,"You're right, this is getting ridiculous. But I'm not the one who's being foolish. You're the one who's refusing to accept the reality of the situation. Your share is worth less with each passing round, and I'm not going to give away my advantage. Accept this offer, or we'll both lose everything.",Alice,11,
