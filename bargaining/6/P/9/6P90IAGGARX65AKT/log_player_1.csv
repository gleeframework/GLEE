"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll give you a generous 10% of the initial amount. Accept and we can finalize the deal!""
}
```

This way, I'll get $900,000 and Bob will get $100,000."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle.  Fair is fair, even with the inflation we both know is coming. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with splitting it down the middle, considering the inflation affects me more than Bob. I'll have to think carefully...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and hope to get a better deal in the next round!"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Time for my next move!

Considering the inflation, I'll try to get a better deal. I'll offer Bob a smaller share, but still a significant one. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting the better deal, Bob! I'm willing to give you a 30% share, but I'm keeping the majority. Don't think you can outbid me!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable, Alice.  I'm willing to give you a 40% share, but I need a larger piece to compensate for the inflation that's hitting us both.  It's a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

While Bob's offer is a bit more generous than his previous one, I'm not sure I'm comfortable with giving him the majority of the shares. I'd rather try to negotiate for a better deal.

```

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Time for my next move!

Considering the inflation is really affecting my potential earnings, I'll try to get a better deal. I'll offer Bob a slightly smaller share, but still a significant one. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 650000,
  ""bob_gain"": 350000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not going to give you the majority, Bob. I'll give you a 35% share, but I'm keeping the majority. You're not getting a better deal than this!""

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're both losing money with each passing round.  Let's end this. I'm willing to give you a 30% share, but I need a larger portion to offset the inflation. It's a fair deal considering the current circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a bite out of my potential earnings!

Considering Bob's previous offers and the current state of the game, I think this offer is a decent compromise. I'll accept the offer to end the game and get a 30% share, rather than risking further erosion of my potential earnings due to inflation.
