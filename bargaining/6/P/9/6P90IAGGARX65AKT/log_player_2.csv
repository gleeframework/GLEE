# Alice gain: 900000

10% is a terrible deal, especially knowing there's inflation.  I'm hoping for a better offer."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're not getting the better deal, Bob! I'm willing to give you a 30% share, but I'm keeping the majority. Don't think you can outbid me! 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice's offer is still not good enough, especially considering the impact of inflation. I'm holding out for a more equitable split."

# Alice gain: 650000
