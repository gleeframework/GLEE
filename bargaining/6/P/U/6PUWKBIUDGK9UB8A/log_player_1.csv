Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This is my offer. I'm taking a large share but leaving Bob with something.  I want to see if he's willing to accept a quick deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I'd prefer more, this is a fair split. With inflation taking a bite, it's better to secure something now than risk getting nothing."
