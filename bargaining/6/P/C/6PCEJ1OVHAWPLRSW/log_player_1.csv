Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 550000

``` 

While not ideal, accepting is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:** The longer the game goes on, the less the money is worth to me due to the high inflation rate. 
* **Bob's Stance:** His ""final offer"" message suggests he's unlikely to budge further.
* **Potential Losses:** Rejecting this offer risks an even worse deal in a future round where the money is worth considerably less. 

It's a tough choice, but taking the sure $450,000 (even with its reduced value) is better than risking a worse outcome."
