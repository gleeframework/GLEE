"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start, and we can reassess as we go along.""}

I'm proposing that we each take 5000 dollars to start, which is a fair and equal split."
