"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives me a large share, but I'm hoping to encourage Bob to accept in the first round to avoid any potential losses due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's tempting to take the $200,000, I believe I can get a better deal in the next round.  Since I'm not losing money due to inflation, I'm in a stronger position to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000} 
```

This time, I'm increasing my share again. Even with Bob's decreasing value of money, I believe I can get a better deal for myself while still leaving a sizable portion for Bob. I'm hoping to incentivize him to accept before the inflation hits him too hard."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting this offer again. Bob's share is decreasing rapidly with inflation, and I'm still not losing any value. I'm confident that I can get a better deal for myself in the future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000} 
```

I'm going to stick with a similar strategy here. I'm offering slightly less than my last offer, but the gap between what I'm offering and what Bob will actually receive is now greater due to inflation. I'm hoping this will motivate him to accept before the value of his share drops further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is now much lower due to inflation, and I'm not losing any value. While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer guarantees me a significant amount of money. It's better than risking further rounds and ending up with nothing."
