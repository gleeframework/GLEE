6000.0,4000.0,"Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob.  60/40 seems fair to kick things off. What do you say?",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Let's try 55/45, Alice. It's a better starting point for me.",Bob,2,
,,"That's a significant jump in your favor, Bob. I'm willing to negotiate, but that offer isn't reasonable considering the inflation working against you.",Alice,2,reject
6300.0,3700.0,"Okay, Bob, let's be realistic.  The longer this goes on, the less we both get. I'm proposing 63/37.  It's a slight increase for me, but it still gives you a decent share before inflation eats away at it further.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4200.0,5800.0,"I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bit more. How about 58/42?",Bob,4,
,,"Bob, you're not factoring in the inflation!  That offer is even worse for you than the last one. I'm trying to be fair, but I need to see some movement on your end that acknowledges the shrinking pot.",Alice,4,reject
6500.0,3500.0,"Bob, I'm sticking to my guns on this one. 65/35. You're losing a lot more to inflation with every round we waste.  Take this deal while it's still decent!",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"I'm not backing down yet. Inflation is hurting me more, but I still think 60/40 is a fair split.",Bob,6,
,,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous! You're fixated on a 60/40 split that makes no sense with the inflation we're facing. You're losing thousands by being stubborn!",Alice,6,reject
6700.0,3300.0,"Bob, this is my final offer. 67/33.  Take it or leave it.  It's clear you're not grasping the severity of the inflation, and I refuse to play this game any longer. This is your last chance to get anything worthwhile!",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,accept
