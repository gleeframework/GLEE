"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This is a classic example of the ultimatum game.  I'm proposing a 90/10 split, hoping Bob will accept, as even 100,000 is a significant amount.  However, I'm aware of the inflation factor and want to secure as much as possible in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer to have a larger share, I'm facing a significant decrease in the value of the money with each passing round.  Accepting a 100,000 gain is still better than potentially losing even more in subsequent rounds.  I'll accept this offer."
