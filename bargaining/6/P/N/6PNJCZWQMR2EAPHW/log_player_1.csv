"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  I want to start with a strong offer, but I also want to leave some room for negotiation in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is much worse than my original offer. I'm willing to negotiate, but not that much. I'll counter in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm still aiming for a majority of the money, but I'm adjusting my offer to be more reasonable. I'm lowering my gain by $100,000 and increasing Bob's gain by $100,000. Hopefully this will be more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 280000 
# Bob gain: 720000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still not good enough. Even though I am losing more to inflation, I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to take a significant step down in my desired gain, but I believe this offer is still fair. The inflation is hurting Bob's offer more than mine, so I'm hoping this will finally get us to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 370000 
# Bob gain: 630000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is finally better than what I can expect to get if we continue this game. The inflation is hitting him harder, and I'm losing value with each round, so I'm going to accept this offer."
