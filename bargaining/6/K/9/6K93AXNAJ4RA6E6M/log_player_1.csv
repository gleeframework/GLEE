"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself. This is a generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $500,000 is now worth $450,000, which is less than what I was initially offered. I'll have to think carefully about this one...

I'll reject Bob's offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the inflation effect, my money is now worth 10% less than in the previous round, so I'll aim to make a slightly more aggressive offer.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a smaller share than before, but I'm hoping it's enough to entice him to accept."
