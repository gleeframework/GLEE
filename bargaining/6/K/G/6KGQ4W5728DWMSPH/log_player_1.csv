"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I propose a 50/50 split to start. This seems fair, and it allows us to see how Bob reacts to the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is already trying to take advantage of the inflation, offering me a slightly worse deal.  I'll reject this and see if he's willing to negotiate more fairly in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48}
```

I'm going to stick with a relatively even split, but I'll increase my share slightly to account for the inflation. I'm hoping Bob will recognize that rejecting multiple offers in a row won't help him in the long run, as the inflation will continue to hurt both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse each round, and the inflation is hurting me more than him. I'm not going to accept a deal where I get less than a 50/50 split. I need to hold out for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

I'm increasing my share again to compensate for the growing inflation. It's clear that Bob isn't willing to budge, so I need to take a firmer stance to ensure I get a decent share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 47 
# Bob gain: 53 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is becoming increasingly unfavorable, especially with the inflation hitting me harder. I need to push for a fairer share.  I'm going to continue rejecting his offers, hoping he realizes he needs to be more reasonable."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

With each round, inflation is biting harder. It's time to be more assertive. I'm increasing my share significantly this time to show Bob that I'm not going to settle for a bad deal.  We have limited rounds, and I need to secure a good portion of the money while it still has some value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 46 
# Bob gain: 54 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is getting ridiculous.  Bob's greed is getting him nowhere.  He's losing value on his share just as much as I am. I'm not going to accept anything less than 50/50, especially with how low the value of the money is getting.  We both need to cooperate to maximize what we get out of this deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35}
```

I'm pushing harder this time. I need to secure a larger portion of the remaining value. With inflation hitting me hard, I need to make sure I get a reasonable share before it's too late."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 36.98% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 44 
# Bob gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is clearly being unreasonable.  He's holding out for a larger share, but he's also losing out significantly due to inflation.  This offer is worse than his previous one, and I'm not going to accept it. We both need to compromise to get anything out of this deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

It's crunch time.  We're running out of rounds and the value of the money is plummeting.  I'm taking a big gamble here and pushing for a much larger share.  I hope Bob realizes that we both need to compromise to avoid getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 68.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 43.12% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's greed has cost us both dearly.  It's clear he's not willing to compromise and is trying to take advantage of the inflation. We've both lost a significant portion of the value.  I won't accept this offer and risk getting nothing at all. It's a harsh lesson in the impact of greed and the need for cooperation."
