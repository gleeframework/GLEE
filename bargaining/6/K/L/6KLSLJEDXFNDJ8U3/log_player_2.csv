"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I get $6,000 and you get $4,000.  It's better to secure something now than risk losing it all to inflation.

# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, let's meet in the middle. I'll take a small step back from my initial offer. $5,500 for me and $4,500 for you. This reflects the fact that I proposed first, but still gives us both a good chunk before inflation eats away at it further. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500
