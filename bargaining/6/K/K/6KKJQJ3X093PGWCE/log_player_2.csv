Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out, and the value is decreasing. This is a fair deal while there's still a significant amount left for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but I need you to meet me closer to the middle. This offer still gives you a decent share, and it's the best you'll get at this point. 
# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of Bob's higher inflation rate. While the deal is getting worse, accepting 380,000$ now is still a very low amount.  Bob needs to show firmness to push Alice towards a more balanced deal."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 460000, ""alice_gain"": 540000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm offering a compromise - a slight edge to you, but much closer to fair. Take it or lose another chunk to inflation.""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  With each round, the value decreases significantly for Bob. A sense of urgency is crucial.
* **Showing Flexibility, but with a Limit:**  Moving slightly closer to Alice's desired split shows a willingness to negotiate, but the message makes it clear Bob won't be pushed much further.  
* **Highlighting Shared Loss:** The message emphasizes that rejecting the offer hurts *both* of them due to inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your frustration, but you're losing far more with every round. This is my final offer - meet me in the middle, or we both lose out. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

It's a tough call, but accepting is the most logical choice at this point:

* **Severe Inflation:** The 73.79% decrease in value for Bob is massively eating into any potential gains. Waiting any longer is incredibly risky.
* **Alice's Stance:** Her language (""final offer"", ""meet me in the middle"") suggests she's unlikely to budge further. Calling her bluff is too risky now.
* **Something is Better Than Nothing:**  While not ideal, 400,000$ is still a significant sum. Rejecting and getting zero would be disastrous. 

It's a bitter pill to swallow, but the game's dynamics have forced Bob into accepting a less than favorable deal."
