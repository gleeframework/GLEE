"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. 60/40 seems reasonable for the first round. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better offer. The 5% inflation rate for me is relatively low, so I'm willing to take the risk. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'll take a bit more, considering the inflation rate is in my favor.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The inflation is hitting me harder, Bob. Let's be fair and split it a bit more in my favor this time. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nAlthough the inflation rate is affecting both of us, I still believe I can negotiate for a better deal. Alice's offer is not significantly different from my previous one, considering the inflation impact. I'll wait for the next round to see if Alice is willing to compromise further. The difference in inflation rates between us might pressure her to offer more in the next round. Let's proceed!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation impact, I'll take a bit more. But I'm still open to negotiations.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this back and forth isn't helping either of us.  Let's just split it evenly and call it a day. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on both of us, a 50/50 split at this point seems reasonable. The value of the money has decreased substantially, especially for Alice. Continuing to negotiate might lead to further losses due to inflation, making this offer the most sensible choice at this stage. Accepting this offer mitigates further risk and provides a fair outcome given the circumstances."
