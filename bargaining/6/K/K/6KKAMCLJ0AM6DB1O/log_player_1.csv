Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm taking a risk here and going for a more aggressive offer. The money is dwindling fast, so I need to secure a larger share before it's too late.  Let's see if this works."

Round 10

# Alice gain: 25 
# Bob gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

This is a tough one.  While Bob's offer is very low, it is better than getting nothing.  At this point, with only two rounds left, the value of the money is so low that accepting this offer is probably the best strategy."
