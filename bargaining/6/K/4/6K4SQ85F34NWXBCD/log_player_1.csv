Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to try and get as much as possible, but I'm also willing to give Bob a small amount to avoid the risk of getting nothing in future rounds due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I'd prefer to get more, the risk of inflation is too high. I'll take the guaranteed 500,000."
