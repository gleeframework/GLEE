"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering Bob's previous offer, I'm thinking he might be trying to take a larger share. Here's my next offer:

{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60}

I'm offering a smaller share to myself, hoping Bob will accept this more generous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is repeating his previous offer, but with even less value for himself due to inflation. I'll consider this offer carefully. Since my gain is the same as before, I'll accept this offer.
