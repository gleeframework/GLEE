"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This means I'm offering to give you $2,000, and I'll take $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll need to adjust my strategy. In this round, I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
