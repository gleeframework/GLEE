"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer is in your best interest if we want to avoid inflation eating away at our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's in Bob's best interest to reject and see what Alice proposes next.  The inflation rate will eat away at Alice's gains more significantly than Bob's, so Bob may be able to secure a better deal in a later round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I'm willing to be fair, Alice. Let's split the money more evenly.  This offer is still in your favor, considering inflation will impact you more heavily than me.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear you're feeling the inflation pinch more than I am. I'm willing to sweeten the deal slightly, but we need to settle this quickly. Time is money, after all. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Bob should accept this offer.  While it's not ideal, it's better than what he'd get if he rejects and the game continues.  Inflation is working against him significantly, and the risk of getting a worse deal in the future is high."
