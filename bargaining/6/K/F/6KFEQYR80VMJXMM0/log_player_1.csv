"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent chunk, but I'm not going easy on you yet! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's being a tough negotiator, eh?

I'll think for a moment... Okay, I'll accept this offer. I'll take the 200,000 and hope for better deals in the future!
