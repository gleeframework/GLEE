Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, but my turn now.  This offer is still decent for you given the inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, this is a good deal for both! 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to take advantage of my steeper inflation rate. While a 48/52 split seems close to the previous 45/55, the rapid devaluation of her share makes this a poor deal for me in the long run. I need to push for a larger portion while it's still significant for both of us."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic.  The value for both of us is diminishing quickly.  I need a larger share to make this worthwhile, and this offer still gives you something.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet in the middle, last somewhat fair offer! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, this offer is the best I'm likely to get at this point. 

* **Time pressure:**  We're past the halfway point, and the value of the money is plummeting, especially for Alice.  
* **Shift in Alice's strategy:** Her offer suggests a willingness to compromise, moving significantly from her previous stance. She's likely feeling the pressure of the shrinking pie. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a better deal is very risky now.  If I reject this, her offers will likely get worse, not better, and we risk getting nothing. 

A 50/50 split ensures I at least get a reasonable share, even with the inflation."
