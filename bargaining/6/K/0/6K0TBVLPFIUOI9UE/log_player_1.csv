"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40 and keeping $60 for myself. The message is a friendly invitation to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be a bit more fair. I'll take a slightly larger share, but you'll still get a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 10% less than before, so I'll consider the offer in terms of the actual amount I'll receive.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better. I'll wait for his next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 30,
  ""bob_gain"": 70,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I still need to get a decent amount. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a larger share, but keeping a smaller amount for myself. The message is a friendly nudge to see if Bob will accept this offer."
