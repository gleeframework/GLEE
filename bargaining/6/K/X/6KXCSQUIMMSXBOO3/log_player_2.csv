Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I took into account the inflation, and I am willing to take more risk, so I think my offer is reasonable.""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. It's round 3, and inflation is eating away at our potential gains. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both walk away with a decent amount. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000
