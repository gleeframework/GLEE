Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, and Bob's offer is the same as in the first round, I'll have to be more careful. I'll think about it...

Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Time for my next proposal!

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $7,000 and Bob gets $3,000."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing rapidly!

Considering the significant drop in value, I'll have to be cautious. However, I'm not eager to give up too much more. I'll think about it...
