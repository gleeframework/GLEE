Round 5

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**  We're getting close to the point where I need to be more flexible, but Alice seems to be consistently moving only slightly in my direction each round. By continuing to reject, I signal that I'm aiming for a more even split."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Time is running out, let's settle this. This offer is reasonable and ensures we both benefit.""}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're running out of time, 56-44 is as low as I'll go. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**  It's risky to push further. Alice has drawn a line in the sand and with time running out, getting something is better than nothing.  It's not ideal, but a better outcome than losing everything if we fail to agree."
