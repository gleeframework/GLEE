"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you get 40%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60/40 is a fairer split, considering I'm taking the risk of rejecting your offer.  Let's see if you're willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less, my potential gain of $4000 is actually worth $3800 in real terms.

I'm not willing to accept a 40% share, especially since Bob is still proposing a 60-40 split. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my potential gain is now worth 5% less than in the previous round, so it's worth $3610.

I'll try to negotiate a better deal by offering a slightly higher share for myself.

```

  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. How about 55% for me?""
}
