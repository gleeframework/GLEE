"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you $100,000 and keep the rest.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting strong, Alice. I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a fair deal. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that this is a fair deal, especially considering the inflation. I'd like to negotiate further!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer, I'll make a new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. I'll give you a bigger share, but I still need to get a decent amount for myself.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, Alice. Let's split it 55/45 and end this. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to meet me halfway. Considering the inflation and the decreasing value of the money, I think this offer is a good opportunity to end the game.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer and take $450,000. It's not the best deal I could have gotten, but it's better than continuing to negotiate and risking getting even less."
