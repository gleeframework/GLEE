**Reasoning:**

Alice is stubbornly sticking close to her initial offer, even though the value of the money is decreasing significantly.  I need to show her I'm serious about getting a better deal, especially as we're getting closer to the halfway point."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""This is it, Alice. A 50/50 split is the fairest I'm willing to go. Take it or leave it.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

We're past the halfway point and Alice hasn't budged much on her position. By offering a 50/50 split, I'm demonstrating firmness while also appealing to her sense of fairness. This is a strong negotiating tactic, especially considering the increasing pressure of the shrinking pot."
