This is a terrible deal for Bob! He should reject and see what Alice's next offer is."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

# Bob gain: 50000 
# Alice gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Bob should still reject. He's getting a very small share, and the game has only just begun. There's still a lot of money at stake and time to negotiate a better deal."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 750000, ""alice_gain"": 250000, ""message"": ""Let's split this fairly. This offer gives you a decent share, and we can avoid further inflation.""}

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to get worried about inflation, but I'm still holding out for a better deal. Let's end this round. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob should reject this offer.  While it's better than the previous offer, it's still not a good deal considering the significant inflation. There are still rounds left, and Bob has a good chance of getting a more favorable deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""This is my final offer. We're getting closer to the end, and inflation is starting to hurt. Let's agree on this and end this game before we lose too much.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise a little more, but I still want a larger share.  Let's end this round. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob should reject this offer. Even though Alice is starting to feel the pressure from inflation, the offer still gives her the lion's share of the money. Bob can likely negotiate a better deal in the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Time is running out, and we're both losing money. Let's be reasonable and split the money closer to 50/50. This offer is fair and gives us both a good amount.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer. Inflation is hitting us both hard, but I'm still confident I can get a better deal for myself. Let's end this round. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is still heavily skewed in Alice's favor. Even with the increasing inflation, Bob should not accept this offer. He has already rejected multiple offers, and Alice's last message indicates she might be willing to make further concessions. With only a few rounds left, Bob has a chance to secure a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""We're both losing money rapidly now. It's time to be reasonable. Let's split the money evenly and avoid any further losses.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 10.

Round 11
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.13% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer. Inflation is hurting us both, and we're running out of time. This is the best deal I can offer, but we both need to compromise to avoid losing everything. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a tough call, but Bob should reject.  While Alice is starting to feel the pinch of inflation, her offer is still very unfavorable to Bob.  With only one round left,  Bob is in a strong position to potentially negotiate a much better deal. He can either counter with a higher offer for himself, or risk it all and see if Alice will accept an even split in the final round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 11.
Round 12
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""This is our last chance.  Inflation has taken a huge chunk out of our potential gains. Let's split the money evenly and avoid losing everything.""}
``` 

This is the final round, and Bob has to take a risk. He can either stick to his 50/50 offer, hoping Alice will accept in a last-minute compromise, or he can offer a slightly higher share to Alice, hoping she'll accept to avoid losing everything. However, it's a high-stakes gamble, as there's no guarantee Alice will accept any offer."
