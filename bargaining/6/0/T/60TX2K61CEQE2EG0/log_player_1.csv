"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40. I'll take the lower amount, you take the higher amount.""
}
```

This offer gives me 60% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob gets 40%. I'm taking the lower amount as per my message."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but still fair 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll!

Considering the new offer, I'll think for a moment...

I'm not too thrilled about taking only $300,000, but I don't want to risk going to the next round and losing even more value due to inflation. I'll accept this offer.
