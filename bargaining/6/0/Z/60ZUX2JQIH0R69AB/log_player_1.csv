```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and get it over with!""

# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to take advantage of me in the second round!

Considering the inflation effect, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. If I accept, I'll get $30, which is worth 90% of the original $30, or $27. If I reject, I'll get a chance to propose again in the next round, but the money will be worth 81% of the original amount ($81).

I'll reject the offer for now and hope to do better in the next round.
