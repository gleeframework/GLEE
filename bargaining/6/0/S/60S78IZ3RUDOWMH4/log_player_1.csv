"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and let's end this quickly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000, which is a relatively small amount, but it's a fair start to the game. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50 and end this quickly! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to split it 50/50, huh? That's a bold move!

After considering his offer, I'll decide to...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to give up that much money just yet. I'd like to negotiate further and try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, the total is now $9,000.

Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting desperate, Bob. I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal this time.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a bit more than last time, but I'm still trying to keep the majority of the money for myself. Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not desperate yet, but I'm willing to compromise. Let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth less and less with each passing round!

After considering Bob's new offer, I'll decide to...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think Bob is getting a bit more reasonable, and I'm willing to accept this offer. I'll take $4,000 and call it a day."
