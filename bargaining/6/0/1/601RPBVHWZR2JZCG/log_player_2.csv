While this offer is decent, I'm hoping to get a better deal. I'll see what Alice proposes in the next round."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out and the value is decreasing. This is a strong offer, let's close the deal. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice's offer is better than the previous round but I'm still holding out for a more even split.  I think there's room for negotiation."
