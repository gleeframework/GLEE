"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have less, I'm willing to take the majority 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth less due to inflation, I'm not as eager to give up as much as I was in the first round.

I'll reject this offer and make a counter-proposal in the next round.
