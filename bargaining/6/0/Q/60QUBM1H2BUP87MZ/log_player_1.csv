"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 

I'm going to propose an offer that gives me almost all the money.  Since the money loses value for me with each round, I want to get as much as possible right away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It's better for me to accept this offer.  Even though I get less money, it's still a significant amount, and with each passing round, the value of the money will continue to decrease for me."
