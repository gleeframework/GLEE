"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and leave you with 10%. We can negotiate further if you'd like. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
 While 100,000 is a decent amount, it's worth negotiating for a better deal. There's a lot of money at stake and the potential for inflation means accepting now might be a mistake."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is a fair starting point.  We can both get a good share of the money, and it's a better deal for you than the last offer.  Let's try to work out a deal that benefits us both.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to take 60% now, leaving 40% for you. This is a good deal for both of us and avoids further rounds of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred a better deal, accepting this offer ensures I get a substantial amount of money.  The risk of inflation means waiting for another round could be a bad decision. It's a good compromise, and I'm willing to take it."
