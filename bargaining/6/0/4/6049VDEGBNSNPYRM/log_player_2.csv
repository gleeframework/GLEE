"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I take a bit more since I'm moving fast with this offer. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
I want to see what Alice will propose next, and maybe get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than that. This is my offer.  Let's see if we can agree.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is money! This is my final offer, it's better for you than waiting longer. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
While I'd prefer more,  it's unlikely I'll get a better deal than this, and the longer we wait, the less value Alice's offer will have."
