Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to give you 40% of the money to secure a quick agreement. This is a fair share given the inflation we'll both experience in future rounds.  Let's end this now and avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to increase my offer to 55% for you.  We're both losing money with each round, and this seems like a fair compromise. Let's wrap this up before the inflation gets even worse. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to a more reasonable split, it's still advantageous for me to hold out a little longer. The inflation is hurting him more than me, making him more likely to concede a larger portion in the next round. I'm aiming to secure at least a 60/40 split in my favor, and I believe the pressure of the dwindling pot will lead him there."
