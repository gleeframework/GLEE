"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

This is a 50/50 split, which seems fair to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my share of $4000 is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round. Since Bob's share is worth the same as in the first round, his share is still worth 100% of what it was in the first round.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
