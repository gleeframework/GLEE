"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. Take 10% and let's get this over with. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 20% less for me with each passing round, I'd like to try to get a better deal before the value decreases further.\n\nPlease let me know when it's my turn to make a proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering the inflation""}\n\nPlease relay this offer to Alice. I'm trying to find a mutually acceptable division, taking into account that the money's value decreases for me with each round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still feeling generous, but I'm also starting to get a little greedy. How about we split it 70/30? 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer as well. Although the money's value is decreasing for me, I believe I can still get a better deal than 30%. I'll proceed to the next round and try to negotiate a more favorable division.\n\nPlease let me know when it's my turn to make the next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise. This is a reasonable split.""}\n\nPlease relay this offer to Alice. I'm trying to find a mutually acceptable division, taking into account the decreasing value of the money for me. I've increased my proposed share slightly to account for the loss in value."
