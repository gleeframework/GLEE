I'm going to start with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept it and we can both get something.  Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's a fair offer, and better than getting nothing. Let's take it."
