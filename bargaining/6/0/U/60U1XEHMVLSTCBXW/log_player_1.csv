"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept and we can split the remaining 100,000$ into smaller amounts for a fun activity!""
}
```

I'm proposing that we split the 1,000,000$ 60-40 in my favor, with me getting 600,000$ and Bob getting 400,000$. The message is a friendly suggestion to split the remaining 100,000$ into smaller amounts for a fun activity, but it's not a requirement for the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent share, but I'm not being too generous 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 5% decrease in value due to inflation, my gain of 300,000$ is actually worth 285,000$ (1 - 0.05 = 0.95, 300,000 * 0.95 = 285,000).

I'm not thrilled with the 60-40 split, but I'll consider it. I'd rather not risk waiting for another round and losing more value due to inflation. I'll accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
