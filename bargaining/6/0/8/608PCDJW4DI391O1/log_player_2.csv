"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I'll take 99.9% and you get 0.1%.  It's a good deal, trust me! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible deal for Bob! While Alice is being disingenuous calling this ""fair"", there's no reason for Bob to accept such a low offer in the first round. He has a lot of leverage at this stage."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000,
""alice_gain"": 100000,
""message"": ""I'm feeling generous, Alice. Take this 100,000 while it's still worth something.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This offer is designed to heavily favor Bob while still giving Alice a strong incentive to accept. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** Alice loses value with each passing round due to the 10% inflation.  100,000 now is better than a potentially smaller amount later.
* **Power Shift:** Rejecting this offer puts Alice in the position of making an offer in Round 3, where her negotiating power is weaker.
* **Greed vs. Logic:**  While Alice might dream of getting more, this offer is realistically the best she's likely to get from a rational Bob."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's split it down the middle.  I know you want the most, but this is the fairest way to do it. We can both walk away with a decent amount, and avoid risking losing more with inflation. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, this is a reasonable offer for Bob to accept at this stage. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** Alice's perception of value has already decreased significantly. Holding out for more risks getting a worse deal as her offers will likely get smaller. 
* **Fairness:** While initially presented as ""fair"" to manipulate Bob, a 50/50 split isn't inherently bad, especially considering the time pressure.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Trying to push Alice further could backfire, leading to her making even lower offers in desperation as her perceived value decreases. 

It's better for Bob to take the guaranteed, reasonable amount now than gamble on a potentially worse outcome later."
