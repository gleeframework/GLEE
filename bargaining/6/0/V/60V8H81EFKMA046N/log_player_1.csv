"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 3:1 is too harsh. I propose a 2:1 ratio, giving me 400000 and you 600000. This still accounts for some inflation risk, but also gives me a better share. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
