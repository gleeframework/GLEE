Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 3:1 is too harsh. I propose a 2:1 ratio, giving me 400,000 and you 600,000. This still accounts for some inflation risk, but also gives me a better share.""}"
