"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob.  I believe this split reflects the urgency for me to settle due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position on inflation, but that's a non-starter for me. Let's be more realistic. This offer still gives you a significant advantage considering the depreciation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm aiming for a fair deal. This offer still gives me a slight edge considering the rapid depreciation I face. Let's settle this now and avoid further losses for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to a more reasonable split, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. The inflation is hitting her much harder than me, and she's clearly feeling the pressure.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to see a significant shift in the next round."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's stop dancing around the issue. We both know the longer this drags on, the less we both get. This offer is fair and reflects the changing value of the money. Take it and we both win.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out. This offer is a compromise to end this quickly.  It acknowledges the devaluation while still giving you a reasonable share.  Let's be done with this. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough one, but time is now a serious factor. While I'd prefer a larger share, Alice's offer is finally within a range I can stomach. Accepting now avoids the risk of getting a much worse offer in later rounds when the inflation has eaten away even more of the potential gains."
