Let's see if Bob is happy with an even split, taking into account the inflation that will hit him harder than me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a more even split, it's better to take the 40$ now than risk getting nothing later. The inflation is significant, and it's likely Bob will offer me even less in the next round."
