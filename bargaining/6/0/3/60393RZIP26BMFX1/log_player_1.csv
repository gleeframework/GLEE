"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount, and I'm giving Bob a chance to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share this time, but still fair, right? 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more aggressive in my negotiation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not yet, I'd like to get a better deal!""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my offer will be slightly less than before.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

This way, I'm not giving up too much, but I'm still showing willingness to compromise."
