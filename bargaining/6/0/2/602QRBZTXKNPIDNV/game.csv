750000.0,250000.0,This is my first offer. I propose we split the money 3:1 in favor of me. This ensures I get a significant portion while still allowing you a fair share.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
200000.0,800000.0,"I'm not afraid of a 3:1 split, but I can do 4:1 in your favor if you're willing to meet me halfway.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
500000.0,500000.0,I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. My revised proposal is a 50/50 split. I believe this is fair and reasonable given the value of the money has decreased slightly since our last offer.,Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
100000.0,900000.0,"I'm not convinced a 50/50 split is fair, considering the value of the money has decreased. I'm willing to give you a slightly higher share, but I need a bigger share for myself to make it worth my while.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
600000.0,400000.0,"Considering the decrease in the value of money due to inflation, I propose a 60/40 split in your favor. I think this offers a fair compromise given the current situation.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
50000.0,950000.0,"I'm starting to get a bit desperate, but I'm not going to give up yet. I'll give you a tiny share, but I need the bulk of the money to make it worth my while.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
700000.0,300000.0,"I understand your perspective, but I believe a 70/30 split would be more equitable. This maintains a balance while ensuring you still have a substantial amount. Let's aim for mutual benefit here.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
10000.0,990000.0,"I'm not going to give up now. I'll give you a tiny fraction of the money, but I'm taking the rest. This is my last offer, and I expect you to accept it.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
800000.0,200000.0,"I've been thinking about our situation and decided to propose an 80/20 split. I believe this is a fair compromise, especially considering the decreasing value of money due to inflation. Let's aim for a win-win scenario.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
1000.0,999000.0,"This is my final offer. I'm not going to give up any more. You'll get a tiny fraction of the money, but I'm taking the rest. I'm done negotiating.",Bob,10,

900000.0,100000.0,"I appreciate your determination, but I think we should aim for a more balanced distribution. My proposal is a 90/10 split. I believe this reflects a fair compromise, considering the diminishing value of money due to inflation.",Alice,11,
