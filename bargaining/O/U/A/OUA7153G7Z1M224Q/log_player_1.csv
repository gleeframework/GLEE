"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose to keep $9,000 for myself and give Bob $1,000.  This seems like a fair starting point, as I'm taking the larger share but still offering Bob something.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is tempting, but it's still too much of a loss for me.  Since I'm not losing any value, I'll reject his offer and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob $3,000 and keep $7,000 for myself.  Since Bob's money is worth 5% less each round, his value of the $3,000 will be even less than it was in round 2.  Hopefully, this will be enough to convince him to accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. Even though it's less than what I was hoping for, the inflation is starting to really hurt Bob's share of the money. If I keep rejecting, I risk getting nothing at all in the end. It's time to cut my losses and take what I can get."
