"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money 80-20. I'll take the smaller share to give you a chance to negotiate.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share to try to get him to accept and end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a smaller share, but I'm hoping for a better deal than 40-60. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my share is now worth 20% less than the initial $8000, so my gain would be $6400.

I'm not happy with Bob's offer, as it's still not very favorable to me. I'll try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, my gain is worth 20% less than in Round 2, so my share would be $5120.

I'll try to make a slightly more aggressive offer to Bob.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to give away too much. Take it or leave it.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you in the middle, but I think I deserve a bit more. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 48.8% less than the initial $8000, so my share would be approximately $4160.

I'm not thrilled about this offer, as it's still a 50-50 split, but I'm not getting any younger and I don't want to wait for another round. I'll accept this offer.
