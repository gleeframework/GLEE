{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start fair. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor, since we have 12 rounds to go, and the money loses value with each round. What do you think?""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. We're both losing value with each round, and this way we both get a fair share from the start. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
