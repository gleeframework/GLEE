"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. 60/40 seems reasonable considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's always good to start by trying to get a better deal!  Let's see if we can do better."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6500, ""alice_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""I appreciate your fairness, Alice, but I think we can both do better. Let's try 65/35.  This will give us both a good starting point for negotiation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob, but your offer doesn't account for the rapid inflation affecting your share. I'm willing to be flexible, so let's try 63/37. 
# Bob gain: 3700 
# Alice gain: 6300 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
While I'd like more,  the inflation is making this a risky game.  I'll accept this offer to secure some of the money."
