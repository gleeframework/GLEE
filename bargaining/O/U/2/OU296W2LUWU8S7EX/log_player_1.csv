"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm proposing a 900,000 to 100,000 split in my favor.  I figure it's a fair starting point, considering the inflation will hit Bob harder."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is worse than my initial proposal, and the inflation will only make it more unfavorable for me in subsequent rounds. I'll reject and try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 810000, ""bob_gain"": 190000}
```

I'm offering 810,000 to 190,000.  This still favors me, but acknowledges the inflation that's happening.  I believe this is a reasonable compromise that gives both of us a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 190000 
# Bob gain: 810000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While the offer seems to mirror my last proposal, the inflation has significantly reduced the value of what I'd be getting. I will reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 729000, ""bob_gain"": 271000}
```

I'm offering 729,000 to 271,000. I'm adjusting my offer to account for the increased inflation. It's still in my favor, but I believe this is a fair compromise considering the significant value loss both of us are facing."
