"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this split fairly reflects the fact that the money loses value for me faster. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While the offer is tempting, it's crucial to consider the inflation rates.  Alice's money depreciates much faster, meaning a more even split is likely to benefit both of us in the long run."

Round 2
