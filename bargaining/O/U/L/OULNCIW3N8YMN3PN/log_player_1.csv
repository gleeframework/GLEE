"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but not too generous 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is a bit more generous, but still not very generous. I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and wait for Bob's next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is taking its toll, and the money is worth less and less. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but don't expect me to give away all the money!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which is a bit more generous than my initial offer. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not getting taken advantage of 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money keeps decreasing, and I need to adjust my strategy. Bob's offer is still a bit lopsided, but it's getting closer to a fair split.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and wait for Bob's next proposal. I'm starting to think that Bob might be trying to wear me down with a series of slightly better offers."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The value of money is continuing to decrease, and I need to make a more aggressive move. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Time to take control of the negotiations, I'm making a stronger move!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a more aggressive move than my previous offer. I'm hoping to take the upper hand in the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to get walked all over 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing rapidly, and I need to be careful not to get taken advantage of. Bob's offer is still a bit lopsided, but it's getting closer to a fair split.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer. The 52-48 split is still not ideal, but it's the best I can get at this point, and I don't want to risk going to another round and losing even more value due to inflation."
