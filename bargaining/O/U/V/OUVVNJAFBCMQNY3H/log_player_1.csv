"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
```

This offer gives me a significant advantage, but it's also generous enough to potentially incentivize Bob to accept.  It's a good starting point, and I'm interested to see if Bob will bite!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

This offer is much worse for me than my initial proposal.  While I'm aware that the money is worth less each round, I'm confident that I can get a better deal if I reject and continue to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000} 
```

I'm lowering my initial offer slightly, taking into account the inflation. However, I'm still aiming for a significant portion of the money. I believe this offer remains fair while still giving me a strong advantage. Let's see how Bob reacts to this compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3600 
# Bob gain: 6400 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting worse, and while the inflation is starting to bite, I'm still confident that I can get a better deal. I'm willing to keep negotiating."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer again to 6000, acknowledging the increasing inflation. However, I still believe this is a reasonable offer considering the diminishing value of the money for Bob. This is my last chance to make a proposal before Bob gets to do so again, so I'm hoping this will be enough to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4880 
# Bob gain: 5120 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While Bob's offer is not ideal, the inflation is hitting me hard.  If I keep rejecting, the value of the money will continue to drop significantly.  Accepting this offer is the best course of action to get something before it's too late."
