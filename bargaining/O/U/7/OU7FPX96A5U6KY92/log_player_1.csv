"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, and we can reassess later if needed.""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, hoping that Bob will accept and we can move forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer. You can't go wrong with 60/40, right? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Since I'm getting 4000, that's still a decent amount, and I'm not sure if I'll get a better offer later.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
