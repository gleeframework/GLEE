I propose a split of 9000 for me and 1000 for Bob. This is a good starting point, and I'm hoping to reach a fair agreement quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
