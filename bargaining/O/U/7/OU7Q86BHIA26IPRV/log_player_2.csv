"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. Fair is fair! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nSince the money loses value for me with each round, I have an incentive to finish the game as quickly as possible. However, accepting an even split in the first round might not be the best strategy, as I might be able to negotiate a better deal in the next round, despite the decrease in value. Let's see how Alice reacts to my rejection. \n\n###\n\nPlease let me know Alice's next move."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I'll take a bit more, considering the inflation""}\n\nSince I'm the one affected by inflation, I'll try to negotiate a slightly better deal for myself. Offering 60-40 still seems somewhat fair, but also takes into account the loss of value I'll experience with each passing round. Let's see if Alice finds this acceptable. \n\n###\n\nPlease let me know Alice's response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, Bob, but I'm not going to let you take advantage of the inflation! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the inflation, Alice's offer of 45-55 is actually a better deal for me than it seems at first glance. Since the money is worth 36% less for me now, I should adjust my expectations accordingly. Given that Alice is not affected by inflation, her offer is quite reasonable, and I don't think I can negotiate a significantly better deal in the next round. It's time to accept and walk away with what I can get. \n\n###\n\nGame over, I suppose!"
