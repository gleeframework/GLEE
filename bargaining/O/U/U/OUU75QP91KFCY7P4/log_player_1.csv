{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a good compromise""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I take 60 dollars and Bob takes 40 dollars. I think this is a fair starting point for our negotiation."

Round 2

# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, given the inflation rate.  Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not convinced by Bob's offer. I think I can do better than a 45-55 split. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer.
