Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: You're running out of time, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Even though the clock is ticking, accepting this offer would mean I get significantly less value than Alice due to inflation. It's a better strategy to hold out and hope for a better deal in the later rounds, even if it means risking getting nothing."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split this evenly. It's the fairest deal and we both benefit from closing the deal now.""}

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Even split is not good for me, I'll give you a little less 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is killing me! While this offer isn't ideal, it's the best I'm likely to get at this point. Accepting guarantees me something, whereas continuing to reject offers significantly increases the risk of getting nothing at all."
