"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

This way, I get a decent amount to start with, and Bob gets a fair share as well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to be more cautious. Since Bob is proposing a 50-50 split, I'll accept this offer to get a fair share.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
