"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair starting point""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the original $10,000 and leaving 40% for Bob. This is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm happy to split it 60/40, but I'll take the lead this time. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me in this round, I'll consider the effective gains as follows:

* My gain: 4000 / 0.8 = 5000 (in terms of the original value)
* Bob's gain: 6000 / 0.95 = 6315.79 (in terms of the original value)

Considering the inflation effect, Bob's offer seems more favorable to him. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, so I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'll compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more given the inflation""
}
```

I'm offering to take 42% of the original $10,000, leaving 58% for Bob. I'm hoping Bob will accept this compromise."
