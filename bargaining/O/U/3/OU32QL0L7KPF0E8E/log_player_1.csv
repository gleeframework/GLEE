"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the sentiment of fairness, but that offer isn't in our best interest.  Time is literally money for you with this inflation. Let's make a deal - I'm proposing a larger share for me this round to balance things out. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
