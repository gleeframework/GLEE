Round 2

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: I'll give you a bit more than before, but I still deserve the bigger share

Round 4

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll compromise a bit more, but I won't go below 56 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is compromising, the inflation is working heavily in our favor.  She's losing value rapidly with each round. Holding out for a better offer, even as low as 45/55 in the next couple of rounds, would be significantly more advantageous to us than accepting 44 now."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Let's be realistic, Alice. Inflation is eating your share alive! Take this offer before it's too late.""

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll try to meet you halfway, but I need a bit more 
# Bob gain: 46 
# Alice gain: 54 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is getting desperate, and rightfully so.  Her share is plummeting in value. While this is a slight improvement on her previous offer, we're in a very strong position now. There's a good chance she'll be willing to accept something close to, or even below, a 50/50 split in the next couple of rounds."
