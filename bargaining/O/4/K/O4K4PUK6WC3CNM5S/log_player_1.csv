"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money evenly, since we both have to deal with the inflation. A fair deal is better than a contentious one. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer seems fair on the surface, the inflation heavily favors me as the game goes on. It's in my best interest to push for a slightly better split, even if it means dragging the game out a bit longer.  I'm hoping Bob will become more agreeable to avoid risking a no-deal outcome."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Time is running out, and the inflation is only getting worse for you. I'm proposing a more favorable split for me, but it's still a significant amount of money for both of us.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly bigger share to secure a deal before the inflation bites further into my gains. Let's make a deal before it's too late for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is finally moving in the right direction, and the deal he's offering is quite close to my initial proposal. While I might be able to squeeze a little more out of him in further rounds, the risk of losing everything to inflation isn't worth it. It's better to secure a win now than gamble on a slightly larger gain later."
