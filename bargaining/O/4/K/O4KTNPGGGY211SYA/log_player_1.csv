"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This way, I get a larger share, but it's still a decent offer for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer for Round 2. Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting the 50/50 split, as I'd rather try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

I'm trying to get a slightly better deal than the 50/50 split from Bob's previous offer, while still being somewhat reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation taking a bigger toll on my gains, I'll have to be more cautious. Considering the reduced value of my potential earnings, I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the offer, as it's the best I can get at this point, and I don't want to risk going into further rounds with decreasing returns."
