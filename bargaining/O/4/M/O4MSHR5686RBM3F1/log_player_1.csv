"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

This way, I'll get 90% of the money, and Bob will get 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation factor in mind, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth 10% less for Bob, but the same for me, I'll have to consider the relative value of the offer.

In this round, Bob is offering an even split, which is a significant concession from his initial rejection of my 90/10 offer. I'm not sure if he's trying to get a better deal or if he's genuinely willing to split the money 50/50.

I'll decide to...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the rejection of my initial 90/10 offer and the 50/50 offer in Round 2, I'm going to try to find a sweet spot that's more favorable to me.

In this round, I'll aim for a 60/40 split, which is a more significant concession from my initial 90/10 offer.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

Let's analyze the new offer from Bob. With the increased inflation rate, the money Bob gains is worth significantly less than in the first round. However, his offer is still a 55/45 split, which is closer to my initial 90/10 offer than my own 60/40 offer.

Considering the inflation factor and the fact that Bob's offer is still a concession from his initial rejection, I'll decide to...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
