"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80/20 split, with me getting 800,000$ and Bob getting 200,000$. This is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can end the game here!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, Alice. I think that's the fairest way to go. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less now, the actual amounts I would gain are:

* My gain: 500,000 * 0.9 = 450,000
* Bob's gain: 500,000 * 1 (no inflation effect on Bob's gain)

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, as it's still a 45/55 split in my favor. I'd like to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less again, the total amount is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round. To make a more aggressive offer, I'll aim to get a larger share of the remaining amount.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bigger share to make it worth my while.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, with me getting 600,000$ and Bob getting 400,000$. This is a more aggressive offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bigger share this time, Alice. Let's end this game on a good note. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 27.1% less now, the actual amounts I would gain are:

* My gain: 400,000 * 0.7279 (1 - 0.2721) = 291.16 * 1000 = 291160
* Bob's gain: 600,000 * 1 = 600,000

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, as it's still a 32/68 split in Bob's favor. I'd like to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 27.1% less again, the total amount is now worth 72.9% of what it was in the first round. I'll make a new offer, taking into account the decreasing value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a risk and go for a bigger share, but I think this is the best I can do.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70/30 split, with me getting 700,000$ and Bob getting 300,000$. This is a bold move, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can end the game here."
