{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can adjust as needed.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting 600,000 and Bob getting 400,000."

Round 2

# Bob's message: You wanted a fair split, but I think I can do better than that! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think I'm getting a good deal here. Bob is proposing a 75-25 split, and I'm not willing to accept that. I'll try to make a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

I'm not happy with this offer either. Bob is still trying to get a 55-45 split, and I'm not willing to accept that. I'll try to make a better offer in the next round."
