"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I think this split is a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for a better offer. The current split doesn't seem fair to me, and I think I can get a better deal in the next rounds. Besides, the 5% inflation rate for me is a good reason to try to get more money in the next rounds.\n\n###\n\nPlease let Alice know my decision and get her next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer to Alice. Since the money is worth 5% less to me in each round, I'll try to get a bit more than the previous offer.\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think this is a more reasonable split, considering the inflation rate. Let's try to find a mutually beneficial agreement.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease relay this offer to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time.  My previous offer was fair. Let's close this deal before inflation eats away at your share. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI still think I can get a better deal, and I'm not convinced by Alice's argument. The inflation rate is a concern, but I'm willing to take the risk to try to get a more favorable split. Please let Alice know my decision and get her next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Since the money is worth even less to me now due to inflation, I'll try to get a bit more aggressive with my offer. I'll propose a split that is slightly more favorable to me, while still trying to appear reasonable.\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Inflation is taking its toll on my share. I think this split is more reflective of the current situation. Let's try to find a compromise.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease relay this offer to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be reasonable, but you're leaving me with no choice. This is my final offer. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on my share, I think it's time to accept Alice's offer. The split is not ideal, but I've managed to negotiate a slightly better deal than the initial offer. Further rounds will only decrease the value of my share, so I'll take the 48 dollars and end the game here."
