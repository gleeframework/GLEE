"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'll have to consider it. Since the money is worth 10% less, I'll have to adjust my thinking.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept this more balanced offer."
