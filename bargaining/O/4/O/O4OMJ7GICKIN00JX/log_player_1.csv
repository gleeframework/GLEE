"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10} 
```

I propose taking 90% of the money and leaving Bob with 10%. Since there's inflation, I want to secure the majority share early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, I don't want to risk losing more by rejecting this offer. With inflation affecting Bob's gains, it's likely he won't be as generous in future rounds."
