Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is 10% of the original amount. I'll get the remaining $900,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 20% less, my gain of $300,000 is now worth $240,000, and Bob's gain of $700,000 is now worth $630,000.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
