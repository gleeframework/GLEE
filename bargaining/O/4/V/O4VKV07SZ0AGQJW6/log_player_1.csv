"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the money, leaving Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still holding out for more 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I still get 300,000$, but for Bob, the money is worth 10% less, so he gets 630,000$.

I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, I get to make the next proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's try to find a compromise!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not willing to give up too much more 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts:

My gain is still 550,000$, worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's gain is 550,000$, but due to inflation, it's worth 73.9% of the original amount (100% - 26.1% = 73.9%). So, in real terms, Bob's gain is 73.9% of 550,000, which is approximately 404,450$.

I'll reject this offer, as I can get a better deal.
