"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my offer for Round 1:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```
I'm proposing a 4:1 split, giving me the majority of the money while still leaving Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about it...

After considering Bob's offer, I decide to:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a new offer for Round 3. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll aim to get a slightly higher share to compensate.

Here's my new offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```
I'm proposing a 3:2 split, giving me a bit more of the money while still leaving Bob with a decent amount."
