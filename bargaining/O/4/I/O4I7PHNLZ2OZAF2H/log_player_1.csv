Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, my turn. I'm aiming for a more balanced split considering the inflation. This offer ensures we both benefit. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6400,
""bob_gain"": 3600,
""message"": ""The clock is ticking, Bob.  I'm willing to compromise, but this offer is my bottom line.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be realistic.  We both lose if this drags on. This offer is a fair compromise considering the time pressure. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:** Although the offer is getting closer to a more reasonable split, time is working in my favor more than Bob's. He's experiencing a steeper inflation rate. It's worth risking another round to see if I can secure a better deal."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6600,
""bob_gain"": 3400,
""message"": ""Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Take this offer before the inflation eats your share alive!""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, enough games. A 50/50 split is the only fair solution. Let's end this before we both lose out. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:** While not ideal, Bob is unlikely to offer anything better than a 50/50 split at this point. Accepting ensures I at least get half the pot, which is still a significant sum despite the inflation. Holding out further risks an even smaller share, or even worse, walking away with nothing."
