"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer ensures you get a decent share. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer seems decent at first glance, I'm losing value faster than she is due to the inflation mechanic.  It's in my best interest to negotiate a more equitable split in a future round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Alice, my turn. I'm aiming for a more balanced split considering the inflation. This offer ensures we both benefit.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Fairness:** A 55/45 split is a more equitable starting point given the inflation disparity. 
* **Time Pressure:**  While I could start with a higher demand, time is working against me more than Alice. This offer encourages a quicker agreement.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message aims to maintain a collaborative atmosphere despite the rejection of Alice's initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The clock is ticking, Bob.  I'm willing to compromise, but this offer is my bottom line. 
# Bob gain: 3600 
# Alice gain: 6400 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation mechanic to pressure me into a bad deal. Her offer is even worse than her initial proposal!  While the shrinking pot is a concern, accepting such an unbalanced split sets a terrible precedent for future rounds. I'm willing to gamble that she'll become more reasonable as the rounds progress and the stakes get higher."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic.  We both lose if this drags on. This offer is a fair compromise considering the time pressure.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Concession:** I've lowered my demand slightly from 5500 to 5200 to show a willingness to negotiate.
* **Time Factor Emphasis:**  The message explicitly highlights the time pressure, which affects me more than Alice.  
* **Firm but Fair Tone:** I'm maintaining a firm stance on a reasonably balanced split while still encouraging a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Take this offer before the inflation eats your share alive! 
# Bob gain: 3400 
# Alice gain: 6600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting desperate and resorting to scare tactics.  While the inflation is definitely working against me, accepting this offer would be a huge mistake. She's clearly trying to take advantage of my diminishing returns, but I'm banking on her cracking under the pressure of losing everything as we get closer to the deadline."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Alice, enough games. A 50/50 split is the only fair solution. Let's end this before we both lose out.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** With time running out, I'm shifting to a more aggressive strategy.  This is my final offer, and I'm making it clear that I won't budge.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:**  A 50/50 split is undeniably fair, especially given the inflation mechanic. This removes any room for argument about who is being more generous.
* **Ultimatum Tone:** The message conveys a sense of urgency and finality. Alice needs to understand that I'm serious about walking away with nothing if she doesn't accept."
