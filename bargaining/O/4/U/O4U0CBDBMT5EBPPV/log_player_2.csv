"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. This gives me a slight advantage, but you'll still walk away with a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer was a bit imbalanced. Let's make this fair. I'm proposing a more even split closer to the middle.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's meet somewhere in the middle. This is a bit closer to my initial offer, but still gives you a decent share. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is inching closer, the deal still heavily favors her.  The impact of inflation is starting to become more significant, but I'm willing to gamble another round or two to secure a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 425000,
""alice_gain"": 575000,
""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer, but I need you to meet me further in the middle. This offer is a compromise, acknowledging the time pressure while still aiming for a fair split.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is ticking and inflation is eating away at your potential gains. This offer is a serious compromise. Let's close the deal. 
# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**  Alice is trying to use time pressure against me, but her offer is still significantly skewed in her favor.  While the impact of inflation is becoming substantial, I believe holding out for one more round is worth the risk to secure a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer. It's a fair deal considering the time constraint and the effect of inflation on my end. Let's close this deal and both walk away with something substantial.""
