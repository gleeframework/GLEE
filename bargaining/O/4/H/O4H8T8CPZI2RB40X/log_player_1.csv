"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a decent amount""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll match your fairness, let's see if you accept this time 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 0% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll have to be careful with my decision.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

A 50-50 split is a fair deal, and I'm glad Bob is willing to match the fairness of my previous offer!"
