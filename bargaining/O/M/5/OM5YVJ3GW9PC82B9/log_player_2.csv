"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 3:1. It's fair, considering I'll have more rounds to deal with inflation. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While the offer is tempting, it's risky to accept in the first round. There's a chance Alice will propose an even better deal for herself in the later rounds, and I can potentially negotiate a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
