"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm offering a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game on a good note!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 10% decrease in value, my share of $4,000 is now worth $3,600. Bob's share of $6,000 is still worth $6,000.

I'll reject this offer since it's not as favorable to me as my previous offer. I'll wait for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, my offer will be a bit more aggressive to make up for the lost value.

{""alice_gain"": 4200, ""bob_gain"": 5800}"
