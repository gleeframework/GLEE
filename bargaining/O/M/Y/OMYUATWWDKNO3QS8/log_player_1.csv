"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

This is my initial offer. I'm aiming for a large share, but I recognize that Bob has the power to reject and make a counter-offer in the next round. I'm hoping to incentivize him to accept this offer and avoid the risk of losing money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to keep more of the money, I realize that inflation will only hurt me further if I keep rejecting offers. Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me at least $1000, which is better than risking getting nothing if the game continues."
