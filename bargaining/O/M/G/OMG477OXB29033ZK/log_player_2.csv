"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is a risky game, and it's worth trying to get a better deal.  While $1000 is something, there's a chance of getting more if I reject and become the proposer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Even with the inflation, $3000 is still worth something, but I think I can do better. I'm still the one with the chance to propose in the next round, so I'll see if I can get a more favorable deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}
``` 
This is a fair offer that should be more appealing to Alice.  While I know she may want more, it's a good split and avoids risking further inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm starting to feel the pinch of inflation, and with each round the value of the money is decreasing significantly. While I still think I could get more, the risk of getting nothing at all is becoming too high. I'll accept Alice's offer, even though it's less than I wanted."
