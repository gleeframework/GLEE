This is a pretty aggressive offer, but I want to see how Bob reacts.  If he's not happy with this split, I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob's offer is terrible, especially since the money is now worth 20% less to me. I'm confident I can do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm still aiming for a large portion of the money, but I'm lowering my offer slightly to see if I can get Bob to accept.  He's clearly trying to get the better end of the deal, so I need to be more strategic."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even though the money is worth less now, I'm not going to accept a 50/50 split. I know Bob is trying to pressure me, but I can still get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to try a slightly more balanced offer this time. The inflation is starting to bite, but I'm still confident I can get a good deal.  Bob seems to be playing a bit more aggressively, so I need to be careful."
