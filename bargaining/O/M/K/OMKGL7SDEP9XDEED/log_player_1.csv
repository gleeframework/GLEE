"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm starting with a straightforward 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take 80% now 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is being a bit greedy!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. With the 20% inflation, my gain of $200,000 is actually worth $160,000 in real terms. Bob's gain of $800,000 is worth $640,000.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to counter Bob's previous proposal. With the inflation, my gain will be worth 80% of the original amount, so I'll aim for a higher share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""You wanted 80%? I'll give you 40% and keep 60%""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, I'll take 90% now 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob's offer is getting more and more aggressive!

Considering the inflation, my gain of $100,000 is actually worth around $51,200 in real terms. Bob's gain of $900,000 is worth around $451,200.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. While it's not ideal, it's getting closer to the end of the game, and I don't want to risk getting nothing.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my gain is worth 41.2% of the original amount. I'll try to make a more balanced offer to see if Bob will accept.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob. 58% for you, 42% for me""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will take this compromise!"
