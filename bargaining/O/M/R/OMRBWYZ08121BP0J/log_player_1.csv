"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a fair share, let's split it 90-10""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept it and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50-50, it's a fair deal! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $500,000 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, which is $800,000. Bob's gain of $500,000 is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, which is $450,000.

I don't think 50-50 is a bad deal, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll reject this offer for now.

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my gain is worth 64% of what it was in the first round ($640,000), and Bob's gain is worth 81% of what it was in the first round ($405,000).

Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but not too much, let's see what you think""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think it's still fair 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $400,000 is worth 40.8% of what it was in the first round, which is $408,000. Bob's gain of $600,000 is worth 54.9% of what it was in the first round, which is $549,000.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. On one hand, I'm getting a smaller share, but on the other hand, I'm getting a smaller share of a smaller total amount. I'll think about it for a moment...
