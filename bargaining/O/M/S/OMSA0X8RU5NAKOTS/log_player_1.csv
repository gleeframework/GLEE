"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you 300k, and we can reassess later.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 300,000 dollars, which is a generous starting point. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve a bit more for my negotiating skills. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my share of 600,000 is now worth 540,000.

I'm not convinced that I should give up 400,000, especially considering the inflation factor. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 550k is a fairer split considering the inflation. What do you say, Bob?""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and leaving room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better than a 50/50 split. Let's try to find a better compromise. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my share of 500,000 is now worth 364,000.

I'm not thrilled about a 50/50 split, especially since I've been trying to negotiate for a better deal. I think I can do better than this.

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my share of 400,000 is now worth 239,600.

I'm not happy about this offer, but I'm starting to run out of time. I don't want to leave the negotiation table with nothing, so I'll accept this offer.
