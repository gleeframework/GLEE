"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the $10000 with a 75/25 split in favor of Alice, considering the potential risk of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While the offer is tempting, the risk of inflation makes it unwise to accept in the first round.  By rejecting, Bob has the opportunity to propose a split more favorable to himself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  While inflation is a concern, it's still early in the game, and this offer gives you a fair share.  Let's avoid further rounds and settle this quickly.""
