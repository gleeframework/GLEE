Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  While inflation is a concern, it's still early in the game, and this offer gives you a fair share.  Let's avoid further rounds and settle this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
