"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give away too much 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth 20% less for Bob, he's effectively getting 80% of the original amount, while I'm getting 80% of the original amount as well. This is a slightly better deal for me than the 50/50 split, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject this offer for now and see if I can do better.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time. Since Bob's offer was 60/40, I'll try to get an even better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You're getting a better deal, but I'm not giving away too much""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm still not willing to give away too much 
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really starting to kick in! Since Bob's offer is 58/42, and considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I think this is a relatively good deal for me. I'll accept this offer.
