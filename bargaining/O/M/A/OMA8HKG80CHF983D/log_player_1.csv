"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point.""}

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to find a middle ground, I'm willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money is worth 10% less, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly. With the new proposal, I'd be getting $50, which is worth 90% of the original $55 I would have gotten in the previous round.

Considering Bob's message, I think this is a reasonable compromise. I'll accept this offer.
