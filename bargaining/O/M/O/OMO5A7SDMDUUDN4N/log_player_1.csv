"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive offer, aiming to secure the majority of the money. This leaves a small portion for Bob, but I'm hoping he'll accept in the first round to avoid the potential of losing even more in later rounds due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation rate is significant. Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me a decent amount of money, and the risk of getting less in the next round is too high."
