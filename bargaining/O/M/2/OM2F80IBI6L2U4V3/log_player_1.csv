"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the original $100, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to reassess the offer.

My gain of 45 is worth 20% less than my initial offer of 60, which is equivalent to 48. So, I'm getting less than I initially proposed.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
