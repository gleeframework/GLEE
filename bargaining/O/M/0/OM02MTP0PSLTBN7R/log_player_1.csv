"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split is more fair, reflecting our equal contributions. Let's agree now and avoid further rounds. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not convinced by Bob's offer. I think I can do better than 40% of the remaining value.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll aim to get a bit more. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and split it 50-50, a fair compromise!""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will consider it a reasonable compromise."
