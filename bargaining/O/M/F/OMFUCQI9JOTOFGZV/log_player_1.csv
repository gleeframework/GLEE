"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000 and leave Bob with $2,000. This seems like a generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it quickly so we can start losing value due to inflation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this new offer. Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'd like to get as much as possible. However, I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, as it's a bit lower than my initial offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time. Since the money is worth 20% less for Bob due to inflation, I'll try to take a larger share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value quickly! Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'd like to get as much as possible. However, I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, as it's a bit lower than my previous offer.

But considering the decreasing value of the money, I think I should be more cautious and not risk losing more.
