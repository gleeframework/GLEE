I'm proposing a 60/40 split, where I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and I hope Bob will accept!"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Bob's offer was a bit too greedy, so I'll try to make a counteroffer.

# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on Bob's offer!

I'm not thrilled about the 20/80 split, but I'll think about it... 

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the impact of inflation on Bob's offer. If I accept this offer, I'll be getting $2,000, which is a significant drop from my initial proposal.
