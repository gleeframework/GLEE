"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'm going to offer Bob a small portion (100,000) to start, as I know he loses value on the money faster. I'll aim to keep a significant portion for myself.  Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly more generous than my initial one.  I'm going to reject it and try to get a larger share in the next round. While I understand the value of money is decreasing for Bob, I believe I can get more.  I will propose a fairer split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to offer a 60/40 split in my favor. Since Bob's money is losing value faster, I think this is a reasonable offer that still allows me to maintain a significant portion of the total value.  I'm hoping this will be enough to convince him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is more generous than my last proposal, and with the inflation, his offer will lose value quickly. While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer guarantees me a sizable amount of money."
