"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer is fair and gets us both a good amount of money. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. With the current offer, I'd be giving up too much of the total amount, and I think I can negotiate a better deal. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, Alice. I think this is a more reasonable split.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this counteroffer, I'm trying to find a middle ground that is more acceptable to me, while still considering Alice's desire for a larger share. I'm hoping this proposal will be more to Alice's liking, and we can come to an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's try this again. I'm willing to compromise, but this has to be agreeable for both of us. Time is ticking! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlthough Alice's offer is slightly better than the initial one, I still believe I can negotiate a more favorable deal. Considering the inflation, I'm willing to take the risk and proceed to the next round, hoping to get a better share of the money. The pressure of the time limit and the decreasing value of the money might prompt Alice to be more flexible in the next rounds. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 475000, ""alice_gain"": 525000, ""message"": ""Alice, we're both losing value here. I think this split is more than fair, and it's time for us to come to an agreement.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I'm trying to emphasize the urgency of the situation due to inflation and the passing rounds. By offering a slightly larger share to myself, I'm attempting to assert my position while still appearing reasonable and open to compromise. I'm hoping that Alice will see the value in settling now rather than risking further loss of value in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer. It's a reasonable compromise considering the time pressure and inflation.  Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 425000 
# Alice gain: 575000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on the value of the money, especially for me, I think it's wise to accept Alice's offer at this point. The difference between what I wanted and what Alice is offering is becoming less significant due to the decreasing value of the money. Given that this is Alice's ""final offer"" and the risk of ending up with nothing if we don't reach an agreement within the remaining rounds, I believe accepting this offer is the most prudent decision. It's better to secure a certain amount now than to risk losing everything."
