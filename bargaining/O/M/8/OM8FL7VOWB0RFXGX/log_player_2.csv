It seems Alice is determined to take most of the money, and Bob is determined to fight for a fairer deal. Even with the extreme inflation, Bob is holding strong and refusing to accept Alice's offers. This demonstrates a strong sense of fairness and a willingness to stand his ground even when faced with significant financial disadvantages."

At this point, Bob likely realizes the futility of trying to get anything more. Alice is clearly not willing to budge, and the inflation is eating away at any potential gains. This offer, while still unfavorable, is the closest Bob can get to a fair deal."

Round 21
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 98.85% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Bob is in a very difficult position.  The inflation has reduced his potential gains to almost nothing, and Alice is clearly not going to compromise.  At this point, accepting even a tiny amount of money is better than getting nothing at all."
