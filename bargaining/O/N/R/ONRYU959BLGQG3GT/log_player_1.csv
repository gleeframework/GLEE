"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 
 
This offer reflects that I believe Bob will accept a small portion of the money to avoid potentially losing it all in the next round due to inflation. I'm trying to secure the majority of the money for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I would prefer a larger portion of the money, accepting this offer guarantees me a significant amount and avoids the risk of getting nothing in subsequent rounds due to inflation."
