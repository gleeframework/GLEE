"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. We can negotiate further from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. This way, we both get a decent chunk of the money, and we can discuss further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think I deserve more for starting the game 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll have to be more cautious with my decision.

I'll reject Bob's offer and wait for a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my proposal accordingly. Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, Bob, but I need a fair share for my efforts.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. Let's settle for a 50/50 split 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","A 50/50 split sounds like a reasonable compromise, especially considering the decreasing value of the money due to inflation. I'll accept Bob's offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
