"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I propose that I receive $6000 and Bob receives $4000. Given that the money's value decreases with each round, starting with a fairly even division seems reasonable. The message ""Let's divide fairly"" is intended to convey a sense of cooperation and fairness in the initial proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. Let's split it down the middle! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nIn this round, Bob's offer suggests a split where I receive $4000 and he receives $6000. Considering the inflation, my $4000 is worth 10% less than in the first round, and his $6000 is worth 20% less. Given that his money is devaluing faster, I believe holding out for a better offer or making a counteroffer in the next round could yield a more favorable outcome for me. Thus, I reject his offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's adjust""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I've adjusted my offer slightly, proposing that I receive $5800 and Bob receives $4200. Given that his money is devaluing at a faster rate, I've shifted the split to reflect this, but still aim to maintain a sense of fairness and compromise. The message ""Considering inflation, let's adjust"" is meant to convey my reasoning and encourage Bob to consider the impact of inflation on our negotiations."
