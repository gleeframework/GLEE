"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, and I'll take the remaining $600,000. This is a relatively generous offer, considering I don't know what Bob's strategy is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Considering the inflation, my gain of $300,000 is actually worth 95% of $300,000, or $285,000, while Bob's gain of $700,000 is worth 90% of $700,000, or $630,000.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the decreasing value of money due to inflation.

My offer is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}
```

This time, I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping a significant amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking its toll!

Let's calculate the actual values:

My gain of $450,000 is worth 85.74% of the original $1,000,000, or $857,400.

Bob's gain of $550,000 is worth 72.9% of the original $1,000,000, or $729,000.

I'm not sure if this offer is the best I can get, but it's a relatively close split. I'll think about it...
