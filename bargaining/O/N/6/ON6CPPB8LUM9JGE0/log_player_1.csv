"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a toll on my potential earnings.

I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since I'm getting a smaller share than before, I might as well try to negotiate further. I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, I'll aim for a slightly higher share to compensate for the erosion of value. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a bite out of my potential earnings now. But I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money is worth significantly less than it was in the first round, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

However, Bob's offer is still quite close to an even split, and I'm not sure if I want to risk going to the next round and facing even more severe inflation. I'll accept this offer.
