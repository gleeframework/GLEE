"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 10% and keep 90%""
}
```

This way, I'm keeping most of the money, but giving Bob a decent amount to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a 50/50 split, let's meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. With the inflation, my gain is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round. I'm not sure if I should take a 50/50 split now, considering the decreasing value of the money.

I'll reject this offer for now. I'll try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, the money is worth 64% of its original value due to inflation. I'll try to take advantage of this.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 40% now, but I'm not sure if it's worth it with the inflation""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly biased split, but I think it's worth it for a higher share 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 51.2% of its original value. Considering Bob's offer, I'm getting a smaller share, but it's still a decent amount.

However, I'm not sure if I should take it, since I'm not sure how much Bob's gain is worth in real terms. He might be getting a much better deal than I am.

I'll reject this offer.
