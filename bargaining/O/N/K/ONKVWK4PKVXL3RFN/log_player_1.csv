"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's end the game""}

I'm proposing a 4:1 ratio in my favor, with me getting 800,000 and Bob getting 200,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 3:7 ratio, but I'm willing to consider it. Since the money is worth 20% less than before, I'll have to think carefully about whether this is the best I can get.

For now, I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Trying to find a middle ground, hope this works!""}

I'm trying to find a compromise by offering a 4.5:5.5 ratio, which is closer to a 1:1 split. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in this offer and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meeting you in the middle, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain! With the money worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'm getting a much smaller share.

However, I'm not thrilled about the 2:3 ratio, but I'm willing to consider it. I'll have to think carefully about whether this is the best I can get.

For now, I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 350000, ""bob_gain"": 650000, ""message"": ""Last chance, let's make a deal!""}

I'm trying to squeeze out a bit more by offering a 3.5:6.5 ratio, which is still a compromise, but I'm hoping it's the best I can get. This might be my last chance to make a deal, so I'm being a bit more aggressive."
