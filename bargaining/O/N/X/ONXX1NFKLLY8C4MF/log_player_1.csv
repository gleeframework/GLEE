Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 60/40, I'll take the bigger share since the inflation hurts you more. This is a fair starting point.

# Bob gain: 600000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable. I'm taking into account the inflation and proposing a 50/50 split. This is a fair offer for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"",
""message"": ""Alright Bob, a 50/50 split it is. Let's finalize this before inflation eats away at our potential gains any further.""
}
``` 

While I was aiming for a higher share, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is the most strategic decision. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:** The longer the game goes on, the less our potential gains are worth. Accepting now minimizes further losses due to inflation.
* **Time Pressure:** With only 8 rounds remaining, the risk of walking away with nothing increases significantly if I reject this offer.
* **Fairness:** Bob's offer acknowledges the impact of inflation on both of us, making a 50/50 split a reasonable outcome."
