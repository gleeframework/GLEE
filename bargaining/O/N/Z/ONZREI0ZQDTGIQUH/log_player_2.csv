"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 90% and you can have 10%. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
I'm not happy with a 10% cut. Let's see if we can do better."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is a fair starting point. Let's work towards a solution that benefits both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take a smaller share this time. I think 60% is a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer a larger share, a 40% cut is better than risking a smaller share in the next round."
