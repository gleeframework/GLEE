"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this fair offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a small share, but I think I deserve more. Let's see if you can do better. 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a bite out of my potential earnings.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering the 20% reduction in value, I'm only getting $200,000 (250,000 * 0.8) in real terms.

I'll reject this offer for now and try to do better in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to counter Bob's previous proposal.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 300000,
  ""bob_gain"": 700000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slight edge, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 30/70 split, which is a bit more in Bob's favor, but I'm hoping it's still a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced you're getting a fair share. I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give away the whole farm. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings now. The money I'd gain from this offer is worth only $96,000 (200,000 * 0.48) in real terms.

Considering the offer, I'm not thrilled, but I'm also not eager to risk going to the next round and losing even more value. I'll accept this offer, hoping it's the best I can get.
