"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start to our negotiations!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $400,000. I'm keeping 60%, which is $600,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my $600,000 from the first round is now worth 90% of its original value, which is $540,000. Bob's $400,000 is now worth 95% of its original value, which is $380,000.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll have $300,000, which is worth 90% of its original value, $270,000. Bob will have $700,000, which is worth 95% of its original value, $665,000.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. It's a better deal than the first one, but I'm not sure if I'm getting the best possible deal.

I'll reject this offer for now and make a new one.
