Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, it's a fair start!""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script! I'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, recognizing that I'll be taking on the risk of inflation in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'd rather not give Bob a larger share, especially considering the inflation factor. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.
