"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60-40, it's a fair start! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

Let's see if we can get a better deal!  I'm not convinced a 60-40 split is fair, especially considering the inflation factor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's flip the script! I'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, recognizing that I'll be taking on the risk of inflation in the next round.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle, let's split it 55-45! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
I'm willing to take the 4500,  considering the inflation and that we're already in round 3. Let's end this before things get worse for me!"
