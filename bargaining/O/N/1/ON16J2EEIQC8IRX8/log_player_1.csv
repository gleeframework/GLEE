"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

This way, I get 60% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about it...

Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll need to consider that when evaluating the offer. If I accept, I'll get $250,000, which is worth 90% of the original $275,000 I would have gotten in the first round. That's a good deal!
