"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 4:1 in my favor""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the total amount, which is $800,000, and Bob gets 20%, which is $200,000. I'm framing it as a ""fair"" split, but with a slight bias towards myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, 1:1 split 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 1:1 split, but I don't want to risk losing more value due to inflation. I'll accept Bob's offer.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
