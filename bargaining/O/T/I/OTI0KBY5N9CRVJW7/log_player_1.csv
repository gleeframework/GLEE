"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it almost equally""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $450,000 and I'll take $550,000. I think it's a fair offer, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it to avoid losing value due to inflation. Let me know what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair to split it almost equally, but I'd like a slightly bigger share this time. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not happy with Bob's offer, so I'll reject it. The value of the money has decreased by 5% due to inflation, but Bob is still offering me the same amount I offered him in the previous round. I think I can do better than that. Let's move on to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:


{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I think this is a reasonable compromise""
}\n\nI'm taking into account the fact that the money is worth 10% less than in the first round (5% decrease in each of the first two rounds), so I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share than I did initially. I hope this offer is more acceptable to him. Let me know what he says!"
