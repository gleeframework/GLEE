"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I'm offering you $400,000, and I'll take $600,000. It's a 60-40 split, which is a pretty fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The offer is the same as mine from Round 1, but with the money being worth 20% less now. I'll have to think carefully about this...

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
