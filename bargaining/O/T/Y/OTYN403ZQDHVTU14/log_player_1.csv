"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose that Alice receives $900,000 and Bob receives $100,000.  I think this is a fair starting point, as it gives Bob a decent share while still allowing Alice to get the majority."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

``` 

I'm lowering my proposed share slightly to 850,000, while increasing Bob's to 150,000.  This shows I'm willing to compromise, but I still need to secure a larger share to make this worthwhile."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}
```

We're running out of time, and the value of the money is dropping rapidly. I'm willing to give up a significant portion of my proposed share to reach an agreement. This offer gives Bob a 35% share, which is a very generous offer considering the circumstances."

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

Time is running out, and the value of the money is rapidly diminishing. I'm making a final effort to secure a significant share, but I recognize that I need to be more flexible to reach an agreement.  This offer gives Bob a 45% share, which is a substantial portion."
