"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can call it a day!""
}
```

This way, I get 80% of the original $100, and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a bit more 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll consider the values in the offer.

In this case, I get $40, which is the same as in the first round, and Bob gets $60, which is 20% less than the $75 he would have gotten in the first round.

I'll reject this offer because I think I can do better than this.
