Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","### Assistant: Round 2\n\nMy offer:\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'll take 55 and you get 45. That way we both have a good amount and can avoid further inflation.""}\nWill Alice accept this offer?\n###\n\nPlease respond with Alice's decision."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time.  We're both losing value with each round, so a 50/50 split is the fairest way to avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n### Assistant: Round 3\n\nMy response:\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\nI'll accept the 50/50 split to avoid further losses due to inflation.\n###\n\nPlease let me know the outcome.\n###\n\n(If I had rejected, my next offer would have considered the decreasing value and aimed for a mutually beneficial split, but given the even split, accepting seems the best course of action.)"
