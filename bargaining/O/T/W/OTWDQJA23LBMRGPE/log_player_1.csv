Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going for a big chunk of the money in the first round, hoping Bob will be tempted by the chance to get anything at all.  Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more,  5000 is a significant amount, and with each round the value decreases.  Accepting this offer ensures I get a good chunk of the money."
