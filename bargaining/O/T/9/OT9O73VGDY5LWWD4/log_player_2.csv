"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's a decent starting point, I know the money will be worth less in future rounds. I'm going to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}
``` 
Let's see if Alice will agree to a more balanced split."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, I'm concerned about the inflation rate.  I'm not sure I can get a better deal in future rounds.  Accepting this offer is a good way to secure some value."
