60.0,40.0,Let's start fair.  I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  We can always negotiate later!,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
20.0,80.0,"I'm willing to give you a small share, but I think 80/20 is a more reasonable starting point. Let's see if you can do better than that!",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
45.0,55.0,"Okay, let's try to find a compromise. I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share at 45/55, but I think that's a more equitable split considering the inflation. What do you think?",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
30.0,70.0,"I'm still not convinced that 55/45 is fair. I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think 70/30 is a more reasonable compromise. Let's see if you can do better than that!",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
40.0,60.0,I'm still not happy with the current split. But let's try to be realistic.  I think 40/60 is a fair compromise given the inflation. It's time to make a deal before we both lose more!,Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,accept
