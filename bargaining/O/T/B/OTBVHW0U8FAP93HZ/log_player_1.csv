"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 20% and take the rest.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20 dollars, which is a relatively small amount, but it's a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  We both get the most this way. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 16 dollars (80 x 0.8), and Bob's gain is worth 18 dollars (20 x 0.9).

I'm not sure if splitting it evenly is the best option, as it might not be the most optimal for me. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth 20% less for me (80% of 16 dollars = 12.8 dollars), and 10% less for Bob (90% of 18 dollars = 16.2 dollars).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you 40% this time, but I need to get a bigger share to make it worth my while.""
}
```"
