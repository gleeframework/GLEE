"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it more evenly this time. I'll take a slightly larger share to compensate for the potential inflation, but I think a fairer split will keep things amicable. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","{
