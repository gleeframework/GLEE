"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'll propose a 90/10 split, keeping $900,000 for myself and offering Bob $100,000.  This seems like a fair starting point, as it gives Bob a significant share, but also secures a large majority for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob is offering a 30/70 split, which is a significant decrease from my initial proposal. While the money is worth less due to inflation, I still believe I can secure a better deal.  I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a more favorable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

I'll propose a 55/45 split this time.  While the money is worth less due to inflation, I think I can still get a decent deal.  I'll keep $550,000 and offer Bob $450,000. This is a more balanced proposal that still gives me a comfortable majority."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob is offering a 40/60 split. While this is worse than the 55/45 split I proposed, it is still a decent amount of money, considering the inflation.  I'd rather take what I can get than risk getting nothing at all if we continue to negotiate."
