"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can call it a day."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going all the way to 50/50 yet! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting, and my gain is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round.

Considering Bob's offer, I think I can do better than 40% of the remaining amount. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is still eating away at the value of the money, and now my gain is worth 64% of what it was in the first round.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you in the middle, but I'm not giving up much more!""
}
```

I'm trying to squeeze out a slightly better deal for myself, but I'm still willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give away the whole farm! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of my potential gains. Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about the 30% I'd be getting, but it's better than nothing.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is still eating away at the value of the money, and now my gain is worth 40.96% of what it was in the first round.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3600,
  ""bob_gain"": 6400,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give a bit more, but I'm not going to be taken advantage of!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and not giving Bob too much."
