"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a relatively even division, but I'm offering a slightly larger share to myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a larger share, but willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my potential gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round. Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about giving up a significant portion of the money, but I'm willing to compromise. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
