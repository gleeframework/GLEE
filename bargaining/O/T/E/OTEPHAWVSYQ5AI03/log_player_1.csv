"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. I'm framing it as a fair split, but I'm actually trying to get a good chunk of the money early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split in my favor is more fair, considering I'm the one proposing this time.  Let's move forward with this. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my $6,000 gain from the first round is now worth only 80% of its original value, so I'd get $4,800. And Bob's $4,000 gain from the first round is now worth 90% of its original value, so he'd get $3,600.

I'm not willing to accept a 60-40 split in Bob's favor, especially since he's the one proposing this time. I'll reject his offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, my gain is worth 64% of its original value (80% of 80% = 64%) due to the cumulative 20% inflation. I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6400,
  ""bob_gain"": 3600,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not getting taken advantage of!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $3,600 and keeping $6,400 for myself. Let's see if he accepts this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's compromise.  I'll take a slightly smaller share than my last offer, but I think this is fair considering the inflation. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 4600 
# Bob gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money!

In this round, my gain is worth 48.8% of its original value, so I'd get $4,480. Bob's gain is worth 72.9% of its original value, so he'd get $5,794.

I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'm willing to accept it since it's a slightly better deal than the previous one. I'll take the $4,600 and call it a day.
