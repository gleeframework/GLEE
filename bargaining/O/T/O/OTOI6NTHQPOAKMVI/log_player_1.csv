Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly considering the inflation impact""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering a division where I take $5500 and Bob takes $4500, with a message suggesting a fair split considering the impact of inflation on the game. Your turn!"

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a more balanced split considering the inflation impact. I believe this offers a fairer outcome for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe that the proposed split, considering the inflation impact, still doesn't favor me fairly. I'll proceed to the next round to make a new proposal."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering the increased inflation impact on your end, I believe this is a more suitable division.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I'm adjusting my offer to take into account the greater impact of inflation on Bob's gains. I'm proposing that I take $5800 and Bob takes $4200, with a message explaining my reasoning. Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: With the inflation impacting us both, let's try a 50/50 split for a more equitable outcome. This avoids the risk of further rounds and potential further losses. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI'm accepting Bob's offer because, given the significant impact of inflation on both our gains, a 50/50 split seems like a reasonable and equitable outcome. Continuing to further rounds risks both of us losing more value to inflation."
