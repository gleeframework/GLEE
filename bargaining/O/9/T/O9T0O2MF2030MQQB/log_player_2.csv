Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the increased inflation impact on your end, I'm willing to take a bit less than before, but still need to compensate for my own loss. This should be a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800
