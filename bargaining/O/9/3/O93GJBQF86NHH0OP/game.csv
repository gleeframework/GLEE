4500.0,5500.0,I think 60-40 is a bit too biased. How about we meet in the middle at 55-45?,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Let's be fair. Since we both rejected the previous offers, I think a 50-50 split is the best way to move forward. This way, we both get a good deal, even with the inflation.",Alice,3,
