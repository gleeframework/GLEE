"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing to split the $100 equally between us, with each of us getting $50."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not accepting this offer. I was hoping for a more equal split, and Bob's offer is too skewed in his favor. I'd like to propose a new offer and see if we can come to a more balanced agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly bigger share, but I still want a fair deal!""}

I'm proposing a slightly more generous offer, giving Bob a larger share, but still keeping a decent amount for myself. Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this one!"
