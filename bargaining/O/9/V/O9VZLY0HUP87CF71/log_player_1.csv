"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the $10,000, and Bob gets the remaining 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to be more cautious. Since Bob's offer is 50-50 split, I'll consider it carefully.

I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the effects of inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher share to compensate for the decreasing value of money. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on the money's value. Given the significant drop in value, I'll aim to get a higher share to make up for it. Bob's offer is a 40-60 split, which is more favorable to me than the previous round's offer.

I'll accept this offer.
