"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we divide the money 3:2 in my favor, considering the risk and effort involved. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's early in the game and I can potentially get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I think a 6:4 split is more fair, considering we both have equal opportunity to reject offers. What do you say?"" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the rejection of the previous offers, I propose an equal division of the money, acknowledging the symmetry of our situation. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
 
Even though inflation is affecting my money, I'd rather secure a 50/50 split now than risk getting a worse deal in the future."
