"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering to take $8,000 and leaving $2,000 for Bob. I'm framing this as a fair starting point, but I'm open to negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, let's see if we can find a better split from here 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, Bob's offer is worth less to me, so I have a slight advantage.

I'll consider the offer and respond:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I can do better than that. I'll make a new offer.""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and planning to make a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think I deserve the majority. Let's see if you'll accept.""
}
```

I'm increasing the amount I'm willing to give Bob, but still keeping the majority for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation. Let's see if you'll meet me in the middle 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the increased inflation, Bob's offer is worth even less to me, so I have an even bigger advantage.

However, I notice that Bob's offer is now more favorable to him than my previous offer, and I'm starting to feel pressure to meet him in the middle.

I'll consider the offer and respond:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, I'll meet you in the middle. I think this is a fair compromise.""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer, and we can finally settle on a division of the $10,000."
