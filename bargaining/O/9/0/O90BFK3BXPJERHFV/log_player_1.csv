"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}
```

I propose to take 990,000 dollars and leave 10,000 dollars for Bob. I want to secure a large share early on, as inflation will significantly decrease the value of the money in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, it's better to secure half the money now. Inflation will erode the value of any future earnings, and it's likely Bob will offer less in the next round."
