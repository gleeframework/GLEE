I'm going to start with a very generous offer to Bob. I'm hoping he'll accept, since the money will be worth less to him in subsequent rounds."

Round 2

Bob's offer:

# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This offer is terrible for me, and the money will be worth even less in the following rounds. I need to negotiate a much better deal."
