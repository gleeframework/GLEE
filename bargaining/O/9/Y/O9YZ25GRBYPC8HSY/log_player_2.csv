"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer still gives you a significant chunk. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to reject this offer.  Even though it's a decent amount, I know that if I reject, I'll have the chance to propose a better deal for myself in the next round.  Since the money will lose value for me, but not for Alice, I need to be strategic."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering the inflation factor will affect my share in the next round. Let's be efficient and end this now.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the inflation is working against you, but my offer is still the most reasonable. Let's settle this now before it gets any worse for you. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer again. While the offer is slightly better than the first round, it's still not a fair split considering the inflation. I'm confident that I can propose a better deal for myself in the next round, especially since the money will be worth even less for me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""The inflation is getting serious, let's end this now with a 50/50 split. It's the fairest solution considering the circumstances.""}
