"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\nI'm offering $6000 to myself and $4000 to Bob, with a message suggesting a fair split. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly. This way we both get a good share. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, considering the inflation, I can potentially get a better deal in the next rounds. Since the money is worth 20% less for Bob in each subsequent round, he may be more inclined to offer me a larger share to avoid further losses. I'll take the risk and make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""Consider the inflation, this is a good deal for you""}\n\nIn this round, I'm increasing my proposed share to $6500 and decreasing Bob's share to $3500. Given the inflation, where Bob's money is worth 20% less in each round, I believe this is still a reasonable offer for him, considering the decreasing value of his potential gain over time. The message aims to prompt Bob to consider the impact of inflation on his share and recognize that accepting this offer might be in his best interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We both know inflation is hurting me more. Let's compromise - I'll take a bit less, you take a bit more, and we both get something. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer again because, despite his attempt to compromise, the deal doesn't significantly improve my gain compared to what I previously proposed. Given that Bob's share is worth nearly 48.8% less than in the first round due to inflation, I believe he is under more pressure to make concessions. I will try to leverage this situation to my advantage by making another proposal that could give me an even larger share. The risk of not reaching an agreement and both getting nothing is still present, but I'm willing to take that risk for the potential of a better outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'm increasing my proposed share to $7000 and decreasing Bob's share to $3000. Given the significant impact of inflation on Bob's potential gain, now worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'm pushing for a more favorable split. The message aims to remind Bob of the urgency and the consequences of not reaching an agreement soon, in an attempt to persuade him to accept this offer. The risk of walking away with nothing is becoming more pronounced, but I believe the pressure of inflation on Bob's side gives me leverage to propose a more advantageous deal for myself.### {""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""Inflation is hitting you hard, this might be the best you can get""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to accept a smaller share, but I need something closer to a 40/60 split to make this worthwhile for me. Let's find a compromise. 
# Alice gain: 6500 
# Bob gain: 3500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm rejecting Bob's offer again because, despite his willingness to accept a smaller share, the proposed split of $6500 for me and $3500 for him doesn't fully capitalize on the leverage I have due to the significant impact of inflation on his potential gain. With his share now worth 67.23% less than in the first round, I believe I can push for an even more favorable deal. The risk of not reaching an agreement is increasing, but I'm willing to take that risk for the potential of an even better outcome.### {""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'm increasing my proposed share to $7500 and decreasing Bob's share to $2500. Given the severe impact of inflation on Bob's potential gain, now worth 67.23% less than in the first round, I believe I have significant leverage to push for an even more favorable split. The message aims to emphasize the urgency of the situation and the fact that each subsequent round will only worsen Bob's position, in an attempt to persuade him to accept this offer. The risk of walking away with nothing is becoming more pronounced for both of us, but I believe the pressure of inflation on Bob's side gives me the upper hand in negotiations.### {""alice_gain"": 7500, ""bob_gain"": 2500, ""message"": ""Given the inflation, this is likely your best option now""}"
