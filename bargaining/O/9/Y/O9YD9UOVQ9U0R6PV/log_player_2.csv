It's too early to accept a 60/40 split, especially with the inflation factor. Let's see if we can get a better deal in the next round."

Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500

Let's keep playing. I still think we can negotiate a better split, especially with the inflation factor impacting my share more than hers."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000, ""message"": ""We both know inflation is hurting me more. Let's compromise - I'll take a bit less, you take a bit more, and we both get something.""}

# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

I'm still holding out for a better deal. Even though inflation is hurting me, I think I can get a slightly larger share if I keep playing."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 3500, ""alice_gain"": 6500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to accept a smaller share, but I need something closer to a 40/60 split to make this worthwhile for me. Let's find a compromise.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Given the inflation, this is likely your best option now 
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

This offer is getting pretty rough with the inflation, but I'm getting close to the end of the rounds. Accepting this offer means at least getting *something*.  Let's see if Alice is willing to be a bit more generous in the next few rounds."
