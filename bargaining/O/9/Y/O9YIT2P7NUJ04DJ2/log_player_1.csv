"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable.  I propose we split it 55/45.  This ensures we both get a good chunk, and we avoid the risk of inflation eating away at our earnings. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
 
Bob's offer is better than what I would have gotten if I had accepted his first offer, but I believe I can do better by rejecting and proposing in the next round.  I'm confident I can get a bigger share while still ensuring Bob gets enough to accept."
