"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! I'm willing to give you a generous 10% of the total. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

This offer gives me 90% of the initial $1,000,000 and leaves Bob with 10%. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your generosity, but I think we can do better.  Let's split the money fairly, 90/10 in my favor.  This ensures a good start for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to flip the script on me.

Since I'm aware of the inflation effect, I know that the 100,000 I'd gain in this round is actually worth 95% of the 100,000 I would have gained in the first round, due to the 5% reduction in value.

I'm not impressed by Bob's attempt to ""split the money fairly"" in his favor. I'd rather wait for a better offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","It's my turn again. Considering the inflation effect, I'll aim to gain a smaller amount in this round to make up for the loss in value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""You're trying to take advantage of me, Bob! I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but still a good deal. Take it or leave it!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable, Alice. I'm offering you a fair share, considering the inflation. Accept this and we can move on. 
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to make a more reasonable offer, but I'm not convinced.

Considering the inflation effect, the 150,000 I'd gain in this round is actually worth 85.74% of the 100,000 I would have gained in the first round, due to the 14.26% reduction in value.

I'm still not willing to accept this offer, especially since it's not even the best offer I've received so far.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","It's my turn again. Considering the inflation effect, I'll aim to gain an even smaller amount in this round to make up for the loss in value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting any more generous, Bob? Fine, I'll give you a smaller share. Don't expect me to go any lower!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting nowhere.  Let's find a compromise. I'm lowering my share to 80%, but this is my final offer.  Accept it, or we both risk losing more to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to make a more serious offer, but I'm not convinced.

Considering the inflation effect, the 200,000 I'd gain in this round is actually worth 77.38% of the 100,000 I would have gained in the first round, due to the 22.62% reduction in value.

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me less than 80% of the initial value of the money, especially since I've been trying to negotiate for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","It's my turn again. Considering the inflation effect, I'll aim to gain an even smaller amount in this round to make up for the loss in value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting desperate, Bob. I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm not going to back down. Take it or leave it!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting tired of this game.  Let's cut our losses and settle. I'm dropping my share to 75%, but this is my final offer.  If you reject it, we both risk losing even more to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to make one last serious offer, but I'm not convinced.

Considering the inflation effect, the 250,000 I'd gain in this round is actually worth 62.83% of the 100,000 I would have gained in the first round, due to the 30.17% reduction in value.

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me less than 80% of the initial value of the money, especially since I've been trying to negotiate for a better deal.

However, I'm also aware that if we continue to reject each other's offers, the value of the money will continue to decrease due to inflation. I'm starting to think that it might be better to accept this offer, even if it's not ideal, to avoid losing even more value.
