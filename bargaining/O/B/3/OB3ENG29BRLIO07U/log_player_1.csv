"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new offer, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject.

After calculating the new values, considering the 20% and 5% inflation, I'll have:

* Alice gain: 5000 * 0.8 = 4000
* Bob gain: 5000 * 0.95 = 4750

I'll reject this offer, as I'd rather not give up more than I have to.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $5,500 and Bob gets $4,500."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the new values considering the 48.8% and 14.26% inflation:

* Alice gain: 5200 * 0.5162 = 2684.24 (approximately)
* Bob gain: 4800 * 0.8554 = 4114.72 (approximately)

I'll accept this offer, as it seems like a reasonable split considering the inflation.
