"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\n###\n\nThis proposal gives me a slight advantage, but it's still a relatively fair split. Since Bob's value for the money decreases by 10% each round, I'm hoping he'll be motivated to accept this offer rather than risking a worse deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable. This is my counter-offer. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money is worth the same to me in this round as it was in the first round, but Bob's offer gives me less than my initial proposal, I'll reject it. I'm hoping that in the next round, Bob will be more inclined to accept a less favorable deal due to the decreasing value of the money for him.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlso, I'll make sure to take into account the fact that Bob is more eager to settle as the rounds progress, so I might be able to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nSince Bob's value for the money decreases by 10% each round, I'll try to take advantage of this and offer him a slightly worse deal than before. I'll also try to create a sense of urgency by implying that this is a good opportunity for him to settle before the value of the money decreases further.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""This is a good chance to settle before it's too late""}\n\n###\n\nI'm hoping that Bob will be more willing to accept this offer, considering that the value of the money is decreasing for him, and that I'm still offering him a significant amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to be fair, but I need a better deal. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth the same to me in this round as it was in the first round, but Bob's offer gives me less than my initial proposal, I'll reject it. I'm hoping that in the next round, Bob will be even more desperate to settle due to the rapidly decreasing value of the money for him, and I might be able to negotiate an even better deal.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll keep in mind that Bob said this is his final offer, but since he's under pressure from the decreasing value of the money, I'm willing to take the risk and reject his offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll try to take advantage of Bob's desperation and offer him an even worse deal than before. Since the value of the money has decreased significantly for him, I'm hoping he'll be more willing to accept this offer rather than risking another round.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""This is my final offer, take it or leave it""}\n\n###\n\nI'm trying to create a sense of urgency and finality, implying that this is the last chance for Bob to settle. I'm also taking into account that Bob's value for the money has decreased by 27.1% since the first round, so even if he accepts this offer, he'll still be getting less value than he would have initially."
