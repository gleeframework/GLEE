"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll meet you in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, my gain of $2,000 is actually worth $1,800 in the new round.

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer. I think I can do better than a 20-80 split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me halfway, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, trying to find a middle ground that's more favorable to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me exactly in the middle, no haggling! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really biting! My gain of $5,000 is actually worth $3,650 in the new round.

I'm not sure if I want to meet Bob exactly in the middle, but I think it's a decent offer considering the circumstances. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer. It's a 50-50 split, and I'll take the $3,650."
