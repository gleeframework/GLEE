Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split, with me receiving $900,000 and Bob receiving $100,000. This seems like a fair starting point, as I'm taking the majority share but still offering Bob a significant amount.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is a significant factor. Accepting Bob's offer means I get $500,000, which is still a considerable amount.  It's better than risking further inflation and ending up with less in future rounds."
