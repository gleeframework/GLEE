"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose a 90/10 split, giving you $900,000 and Bob $100,000.  I figure this is a fair starting point, giving me a good chunk of the money while still offering Bob a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
I reject this offer. While I'd rather have something than nothing, I believe I can get a better deal. The money is worth less to me each round, but I still have time to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000} 
```

I'm offering Bob $150,000 and keeping $850,000 for myself.  I'm willing to compromise a bit more than the first round, but I still want a majority share. The money is worth less to me with each passing round, so I need to secure a decent amount while I still can."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

While this offer is tempting, I'm still holding out for a better deal. I'm losing money quickly due to inflation, but I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I can't let Bob take such a large portion of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $700,000 for myself, giving Bob $300,000.  The inflation is hitting hard, but I'm still trying to maximize my share.  I'm hoping Bob sees that his offer is getting less appealing each round, and he'll be more willing to compromise."
