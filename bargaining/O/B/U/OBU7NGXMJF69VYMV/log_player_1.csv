  ""alice_gain"": 60,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose an equal division of the $100 to ensure fairness and maximize our collective gains considering the diminishing value of money in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{
