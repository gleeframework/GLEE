Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting desperate, but still want a fair share 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate as the rounds go by. While her offer is closer to a 50/50 split, the inflation heavily favors me. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can secure a better deal."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic.  A 50/50 split is the fairest option at this point. Take it before time runs out."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a 50/50 split now. While I could push for more, Alice might accept this offer due to the time pressure and the fact that her potential gains are rapidly decreasing. A 50/50 split guarantees a good outcome for me without risking everything on a potentially greedy offer."
