"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start""}

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40. I think this is a fair starting point, and it's a good idea to split it evenly to begin with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more this round 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with Bob's offer. I was hoping to get a bit more than $40, especially considering the inflation. I think I can do better than this. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle this time""}

I'm proposing that we split the money evenly again, but this time I'm willing to compromise and meet in the middle. I think this is a fair offer, and I hope Bob will accept it."
