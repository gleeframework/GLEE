"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a generous, but not overly risky, offer in the first round.  I want to see if Bob is willing to accept a deal that heavily favors me, but still gives him a decent amount.  I figure he might be more willing to negotiate in later rounds if he gets a taste of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would have preferred to get more, the 5% inflation makes this a very risky offer to reject. I could potentially get even less if we continue and I don't manage to negotiate a better deal. It's best to take what I can get now."
