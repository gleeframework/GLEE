I'll start by being generous and offering Bob $100,000, hoping he'll accept this fair (in my mind) offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I reject this offer. Even though the money is worth less, it's not a fair division.  Let's see what Bob offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'll try to be more reasonable this time. I'm offering Bob 600,000, which is more than his previous offer, and I'm hoping he'll see that we can both get a fair share."
