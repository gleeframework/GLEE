I'm starting with a slightly uneven split, aiming for a fair but advantageous position.  Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is trying to take advantage of inflation! I'll reject this offer and see if he's willing to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'll propose a 50/50 split.  It's a fair compromise, and I don't want to risk losing any more money to inflation."
