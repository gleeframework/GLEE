"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leaving $4,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","In the second round, my offer is worth 10% less than the first round, so I'm effectively offering to take $6,000 * 0.9 = $5,400, and Bob is offering to take $4,000 * 0.8 = $3,200.

I think Bob's offer is a bit too generous, considering I'm still taking a larger share. However, I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept his offer.
