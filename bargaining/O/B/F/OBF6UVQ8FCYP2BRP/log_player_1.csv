Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. It's a fair starting point considering I'm the one making the initial offer. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a fair split. It's better than getting nothing at all in the next round due to further inflation."
