"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose a 900,000$ for me, and 100,000$ for Bob. This ensures I get a good chunk of the money, and Bob still gets something.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject this offer.  While it's tempting to take something, I still have a good chance of getting a better deal in the next round.  The inflation is hurting Bob more than me, so he'll likely need to make a more favorable offer to get me to agree."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I propose 700,000$ for myself and 300,000$ for Bob. This is a compromise, offering Bob more than his previous proposal, while still giving me a significant share. The inflation is starting to hit hard, so I'm hoping this offer is enticing enough for him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I accept this offer.  The inflation is biting hard now, and while I'd prefer more, this offer at least gives me a fair share. It's a 50/50 split, which is a decent outcome considering the circumstances."
