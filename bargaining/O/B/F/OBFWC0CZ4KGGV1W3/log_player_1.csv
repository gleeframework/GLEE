"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting 600,000 and Bob getting 400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split is more fair, reflecting my risk of rejecting your offer. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not happy with the 60-40 split, but I'm willing to consider it since Bob is offering me a larger share than in my original proposal.
