"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 

I propose to keep almost all the money for myself and give Bob just $1. This is a risky strategy, but it aims to secure the largest possible share for me while also offering Bob a tiny incentive to accept in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer to have more,  it's better to secure half of the money now than risk getting nothing in the later rounds due to inflation."
