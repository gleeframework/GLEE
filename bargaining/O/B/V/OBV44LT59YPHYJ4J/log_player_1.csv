"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer to end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous, now it's my turn to be fair 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 5% inflation, the $900,000 I could have gotten in the first round is now worth $855,000. I'm not sure if I should accept Bob's offer of $300,000.

However, considering the inflation, I think I should try to get as much as I can. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to make a better proposal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, the $855,000 I could have gotten in the second round is now worth $807,250.

I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""A more balanced offer. Consider this one!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'm not 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is catching up! With the 14.26% inflation, the $807,250 I could have gotten in the third round is now worth $693,119.

Considering the offer from Bob, I'm not thrilled about getting only $200,000. However, I don't have many options left, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with even less value.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer, hoping it's the best I can get at this point."
