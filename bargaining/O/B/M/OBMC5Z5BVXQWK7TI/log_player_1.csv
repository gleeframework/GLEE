"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you take 40%""
}
```

This is a relatively even split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it to get the game started!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'll give you a small chunk too 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is decreasing with each round!

I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

I'll decide to reject this offer. I'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a slightly larger share, but still give you a decent chunk. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, I'll take a bit more, but not too much 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly!

I'm not thrilled with the fact that Bob is suggesting a 50-50 split, but I suppose it's a reasonable compromise. Considering the decreasing value of the money, I'll decide to accept this offer.
