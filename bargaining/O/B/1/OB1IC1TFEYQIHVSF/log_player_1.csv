"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you $100,000 and take the rest.""
}
```

This way, I'll receive $900,000 and Bob will receive $100,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous with yourself, let's try a 60/40 split! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 5% inflation, my gain of $400,000 is now worth 95% of its original value, which is $380,000. I'm not sure I like this offer, but I'll consider it. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer. Given that the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, my offer is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you in the middle, but I think I deserve a bit more for being the one to make the next offer.""
}
```"
