"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

I'm offering Bob $20, and I'll take $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll consider the offer.

Since Bob is offering me $70, which is more than the $60 I would have gotten in the first round, I'll accept this offer.
