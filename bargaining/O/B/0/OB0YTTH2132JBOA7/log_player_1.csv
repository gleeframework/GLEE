"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000, leaving Bob with $2,000. My message is a simple explanation of the proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slightly more balanced split, let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less for me in the second round, I'll consider the actual values.

Alice's gain: $4,000 is actually worth $3,200 (80% of $4,000)
Bob's gain: $6,000 is worth $6,000 (no change)

Considering this, I'll make my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer, as it's a more balanced split and I'll end up with a decent amount of money, even after the inflation adjustment."
