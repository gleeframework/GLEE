"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being fair, but I'm taking the lion's share.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""That's a pretty uneven split you proposed!  I'm feeling generous, but we're on the clock, so let's make this happen.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable this time. I'm lowering my share to 5500, but I'm still taking the majority. Time is ticking, and I don't want to risk losing everything. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down slightly, it's still heavily in her favor.  The decreasing value of the money makes each round more critical, but I'm willing to gamble another round to try and secure a much better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Okay, Alice, let's stop wasting time. This is a fair split, and we both know the clock is ticking. Take it or leave it, but we need to decide now.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Alright, Bob, you're right, time is running out. This is my final offer - I'm willing to split it almost evenly.  It's time to be reasonable, or we'll both lose everything. 
# Bob gain: 5250 
# Alice gain: 4750 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**  This is a tough one, but ultimately the risk of getting nothing is too high now. Alice's offer is barely better than a 50/50 split, and while I think I could potentially squeeze out a bit more in a later round, the shrinking pot and the risk of total loss make this offer the safest bet. Better to take a slightly smaller win now than gamble and potentially lose it all."
