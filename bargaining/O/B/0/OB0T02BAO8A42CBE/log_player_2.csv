"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""I'm aiming for a more balanced deal this time, Alice.  Let's wrap this up.""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:**  It's crucial to reach an agreement quickly. Each round I delay, the money loses value for me.
* **Fairness:** Alice's initial offer was heavily skewed in her favor. My offer is still slightly advantageous to me, reflecting the time-pressure I'm under. 
* **Urgency:** The message aims to convey a sense of urgency and encourage Alice to accept rather than risk further devaluation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The value of the deal is going down, Bob. I'm offering you a reasonable deal considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** The inflation is severely impacting my potential gains. Waiting any longer is too risky.
* **Improved Offer:**  While not ideal, Alice's offer is better than her first one and fairly close to my proposal in Round 2 (after accounting for inflation).
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Rejecting this offer in hopes of a slightly better deal in Round 4 is too risky. The potential loss from inflation outweighs the potential gain."
