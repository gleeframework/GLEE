"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

I'm starting with a generous offer, hoping Bob will accept it and we can both get a decent share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is unfair, and even though I lose 20% of the value of my potential gain, it's better to keep playing.  I can likely get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but I'm still aiming for a significant portion of the money.  Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation, so I need to make a counter-offer that is still attractive but also protects my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly unfair.  I'm still losing more value from inflation than he is, but I'm not giving in to his greed just yet.  I can likely get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still hoping for a better deal than Bob's last proposal.  I need to be flexible to find a solution, but I'm not going to settle for being exploited."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still very unfair, and the inflation is really hurting me at this point. However, I'm determined to hold out for a better deal. I'm not going to settle for being taken advantage of.  I believe I can still get a more equitable split in the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still trying to get as much as I can.  The inflation is really biting now, and I need to find a balance between getting a decent share and ensuring the deal gets done.  I'm hoping Bob will recognize that we are both losing value with each passing round, and we should reach a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too lopsided. I'm losing a lot of value due to inflation, but I refuse to settle for such an unequal split. There are still a few rounds left, and I'm hoping we can find a more balanced agreement.  I need to stand firm and fight for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

The inflation is taking a heavy toll, and with only a few rounds left, I need to find a compromise.  I'm offering a 50/50 split, which is fair given the circumstances and the value we're both losing. I believe this is the best chance to secure a deal before both of us lose everything."
