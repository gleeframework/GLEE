"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start to our negotiation!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, which is a relatively generous offer to start with. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 70/30 is a more reasonable starting point. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is already affecting me!

Considering Bob's new offer, I think 30 is a bit too low for me. I'd like to counter with a slightly higher offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with 30. How about 45?""
}
```

Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The game continues!

Considering the 20% inflation, my offer from Round 1 was worth 60, but now it's worth 48 (60 - 20% of 60). I'll take that into account for my next offer. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and split it 50/50, no more negotiations needed!""
}
```

It's a straightforward offer, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
