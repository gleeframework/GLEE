"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 50/50, a fair start! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer.  While it's a fair split right now, I know the money will be worth less in future rounds. I'll see if I can get a better deal later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm taking a slight advantage this round, knowing the money will be worth less in the next.  Let's see if you'll accept this deal before the inflation hits!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm trying to make up for the loss in the last round. Will you take this deal? 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is taking its toll.  Accepting this offer guarantees me some money, and  I'm not sure if I can do better in the next round."
