I propose to take almost all the money ($999,999) and leave Bob with just $1. 

This is a very aggressive move, but since we have 12 rounds, I want to establish myself as the dominant player early on.  I'm hoping Bob will be scared to reject this offer and risk getting nothing in the end."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is a huge improvement for him, and a significant loss for me.  Even though I'm losing a large amount, I'm not going to accept this yet. I want to see if I can still get a better deal. The inflation means that the value of the money will continue to decrease, and I don't want to be stuck with a bad deal early on. I'm confident that I can get a better offer in the next few rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000} 
```

I'm going to offer Bob $100,000, which is still a significant amount for him, and hopefully enough to make him consider accepting.  The inflation is starting to bite, and I need to start making some concessions to avoid ending up with nothing.  However, I'm still holding onto the majority of the money, and I believe I can still negotiate a better deal for myself in the coming rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly better than the previous round, but it's still not good enough for me.  The inflation is affecting the value of the money more and more, and I need to start making concessions, but I'm still holding out for a better deal.  I'm going to continue to try and negotiate a more even split in the remaining rounds.  I believe that with a bit more persistence, I can get a fairer share of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000} 
```

The inflation is starting to become a serious problem, and I need to take a more pragmatic approach. I'm going to offer Bob an even split of the money.  This is a significant concession from my previous offers, but it's the best way to ensure I get something, considering the rapidly diminishing value of the money.  I'm hoping that Bob will be willing to accept this offer, as it's a fair compromise, and it gives us both a decent amount of money."
