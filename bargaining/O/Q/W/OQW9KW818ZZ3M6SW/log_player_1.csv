"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This is a classic negotiation strategy:  I'm offering Bob a tiny amount, knowing that if he rejects, he'll be the one making an offer in the next round, and I'll be the one getting 80% of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would have preferred a larger share, the 20% inflation makes this a decent offer. Accepting means getting 500,000, which is better than the 799,999.20 I would get after the inflation if I reject and Bob makes the next offer."
