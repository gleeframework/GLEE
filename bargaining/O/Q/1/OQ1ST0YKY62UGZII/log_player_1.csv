Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a little more, but I need a larger share to compensate for the inflation hitting us harder.  Let's split it 5500/4500. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500
