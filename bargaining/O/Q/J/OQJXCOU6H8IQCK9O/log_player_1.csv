"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm starting with a relatively fair split, giving Bob a decent chunk of the money to try to entice him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher share. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal for myself.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With inflation reducing the value of the money, I'll aim for a higher share to compensate for the loss. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}

Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"

# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value. I'll have to be careful with my next move. Since Bob's offer is relatively close to the original 50/50 split, I'll consider it a decent option. However, I'll aim for a slightly better deal to account for the inflation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With the money's value continuing to drop, I'll aim for an even higher share to compensate for the loss. Here's my new offer:

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a huge bite out of the money's value. I'll have to be careful not to get too greedy, or I'll end up with nothing. Since Bob's offer is relatively close to the original 50/50 split, and considering the rapidly decreasing value of the money, I'll consider it a decent option. I'll accept this offer to avoid taking a bigger risk.
