"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take 60%""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering Bob $4,000 and taking $6,000 for myself, hoping he'll see the fairness in the split and accept, avoiding further rounds and the loss of money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 55/45 is a fairer split, considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer because I believe I can negotiate a better deal, especially considering the relatively small concession he made despite the looming threat of further inflation reducing the value of our potential gains."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5250, ""bob_gain"": 4750, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet closer to the middle.""}\n\nI'll propose a split where I take $5,250 and Bob takes $4,750, adjusting my offer to reflect the decreasing value of the money and aiming to find a compromise that might appeal to Bob, thus ending the game before the money loses even more value."
