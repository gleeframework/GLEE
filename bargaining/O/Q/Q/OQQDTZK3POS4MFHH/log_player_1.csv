"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a pretty standard split to start with. I'll keep 90% and give Bob 10%. This seems like a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

While I'd prefer more, this offer is still quite good. It's a fair split, and I'm not sure if I can get a better deal with inflation kicking in."
