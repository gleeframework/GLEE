"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose an even split of $5,000 for each of us. It's fair and avoids any initial conflict."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
I reject this offer.  While I understand Bob is trying to get more, it's not a fair split considering the inflation and his smaller loss in value. I'm hoping we can find a more equitable solution."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500}
```

I'm willing to compromise and offer a slightly higher share to Bob, considering his smaller inflation loss.  This feels more fair to both of us while still acknowledging the need for a balanced outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I accept this offer.  The inflation is starting to hurt, and while I'd prefer a more even split, this offer is relatively fair considering the circumstances and the potential for even less in future rounds."
