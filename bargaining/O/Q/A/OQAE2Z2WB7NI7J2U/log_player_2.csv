"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, considering future losses 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While the offer seems fair at first glance, considering future inflation, Bob can potentially get a better deal by rejecting and proposing in the next round. The offer provides Bob with $4000, but since the money depreciates by 20% each round, that $4000 will be worth less in future rounds. By rejecting, Bob has the opportunity to propose a higher share for himself in the next round, taking advantage of the future devaluation of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Let's split it evenly this time. We both lose money every round, so a fair split is best for us both.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering your loss, this is more than fair 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is still not ideal, accepting it is the best course of action.  Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The money is now worth 36% less for Bob.  This means the $4500 offer is equivalent to only around $2880 in the original value.
* **Limited Rounds:**  We only have 12 rounds total. Each round of rejection increases the risk of getting nothing at the end.
* **Potential Loss:**  There's no guarantee that Bob will get a better offer in the future, and he might end up losing even more money.

By accepting, Bob secures a significant portion of the available money, despite the inflation. It's a pragmatic decision given the circumstances."
