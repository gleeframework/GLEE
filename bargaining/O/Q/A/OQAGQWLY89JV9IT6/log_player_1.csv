"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

This way, I get a decent share, but still leave Bob with a reasonable amount. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation and the previous offers, I'll make a new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

This time, I'm offering a slightly smaller share to account for the reduced value of money. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
