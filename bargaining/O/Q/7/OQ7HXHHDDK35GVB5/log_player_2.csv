"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, I get a bit more 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While this offer seems fair on the surface, the inflation rates mean that this offer will get progressively worse for Bob over time. It's best to try and get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's flip the script, I'll take a slightly larger share this time.  Inflation is a factor, so let's make it a deal!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet in the middle, considering inflation, this is more than fair 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to have a larger share, accepting this offer is the best choice in this scenario. Inflation is a significant factor, and I'm already losing more value than Alice with each round. Accepting this offer ensures that I get a decent share, even with the inflation."
