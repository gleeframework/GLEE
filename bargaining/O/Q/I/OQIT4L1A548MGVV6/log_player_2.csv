"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While it seems like a fair offer at first glance, I need to consider the impact of inflation. If I reject this offer, I'm likely to get a better deal in a later round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, so I'm proposing a compromise.  Let's settle this quickly before inflation eats away at our potential gains.""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Conceding slightly:** I'm offering slightly more than a 50/50 split to acknowledge Alice's desire for a larger share and to incentivize her to accept.
* **Time pressure:**  By mentioning inflation, I'm reminding Alice that delaying a decision is costly to both of us. 
* **Future leverage:**  If she rejects this offer, I'm in a stronger position to propose a more favorable split in later rounds as the value of the money decreases faster for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're willing to compromise, let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is clearly trying to anchor the negotiations in her favor. While her offer is slightly better, it's not enough to offset the impact of inflation. I'll hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""Time is running out, and these negotiations are costing us both money. This is my final offer - let's be done with it.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increased offer:**  I'm offering a more significant increase to show I'm serious about reaching a deal. 
* **Sense of urgency:** By stating this is my final offer, I'm creating a sense of urgency and putting pressure on Alice to accept.
* **Strategic positioning:** If she rejects this, I'm willing to play hardball in subsequent rounds as the impact of inflation becomes more severe, potentially aiming for a 50/50 split or even slightly better for myself."
