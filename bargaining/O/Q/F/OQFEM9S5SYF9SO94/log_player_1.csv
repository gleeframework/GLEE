"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving each of us $5,000. This seems like a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is a fair start, given that I'm the one making the offer this round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I'll consider it.

Since I don't know how the inflation affects Bob's money, I'll assume it's still worth 80% of the original value. In that case, Bob is proposing a gain of $6,000, which is equivalent to $7,500 in the original value.

In comparison, I would gain $4,000, which is equivalent to $4,000 in the original value.

I'll decide to reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share this round, but I think this is a fair compromise""}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob than the previous offer."
