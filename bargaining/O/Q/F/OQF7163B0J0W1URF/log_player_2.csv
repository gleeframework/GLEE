Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","### Step 1: Review the current state of the game
We are currently in Round 4 of the game. Alice has made two offers so far, and I have rejected both of them. In Round 2, I made an offer of a 60/40 split, which Alice rejected.

### Step 2: Analyze Alice's previous offers
Alice's first offer was a 90/10 split, which was heavily biased in her favor. Her second offer was a 65/35 split, which is still biased in her favor but shows some willingness to compromise.

### Step 3: Determine my next offer
Since Alice has shown some willingness to compromise, I will make an offer that is closer to a 50/50 split but still slightly biased in my favor.

### Step 4: Create the offer and message
I will offer a 55/45 split, with me taking 55% and Alice taking 45%. My message will emphasize the need for a fair and reasonable split.

The final answer is: {""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""We're getting closer, 55/45 is a fair and reasonable split. Let's end this game with a mutually beneficial agreement""}"
