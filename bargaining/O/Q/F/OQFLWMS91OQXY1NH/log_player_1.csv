Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 3:1 is too harsh. I'm offering a 3:2 split, which still gives me a decent chunk but also acknowledges your initial proposal. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
