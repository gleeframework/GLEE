Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'm aiming for a more balanced split. This considers the time pressure we're both under.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle of our previous offers 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is sticking close to her initial offer and isn't acknowledging the impact of inflation. While her offer is closer to the middle, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  I need to show I'm willing to walk away to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 520000, ""alice_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""Time is ticking, Alice.  This is a fair offer considering the dwindling value.""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, Bob. I've compromised. Don't let the money lose more value. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is finally moving closer to a more even split, but it's still not enough to offset the impact of inflation. Her compromise is marginal at best. I need to hold my ground for a little longer and see if I can get her closer to a 50/50 split."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's end this. A 50/50 split is the only fair way to divide this with the time pressure. Don't let greed make us both losers.""}"
