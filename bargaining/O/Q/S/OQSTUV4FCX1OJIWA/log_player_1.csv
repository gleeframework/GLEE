"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{

  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the decreasing value of money with each round, I propose we divide the $10,000 such that you receive $3000 in the first round. This way, we can secure a larger portion for you now, before the value drops.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller portion now, but I think it's fair considering the value of money will drop by 10% in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
