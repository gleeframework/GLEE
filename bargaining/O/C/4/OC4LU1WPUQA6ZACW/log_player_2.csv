# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to leverage the time pressure and inflation against me. While her offer is getting slightly better, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  I need to show I'm serious about getting a fair deal, even if it means risking getting closer to the deadline."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm coming down to show I'm willing to compromise.  Let's wrap this up - the clock is ticking! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, this offer is getting close to the best I can likely get at this stage. The inflation is eating into my potential gains with every rejected offer. It's time to be pragmatic and secure a reasonable amount, even if it's not a perfect split."
