"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, hoping to set a fair tone for the rest of the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a bigger share.

I'll reject this offer. I'm not willing to accept a 80/20 split, especially when I know that the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a decent share, but I think I deserve more. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, trying to get a slightly better deal than the initial 50/50 offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm being generous, but I think I deserve the majority 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on Bob's offer!

I'll reject this offer. A 90/10 split is way too skewed in Bob's favor, especially considering the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""I'm not afraid to take a risk, but I'm not going to give you the majority. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80/20 split, trying to take a bigger share of the remaining money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking a risk, but I'm not going to give up 
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is really taking a toll on Bob's offer now!

I'll reject this offer. A 95/5 split is completely unacceptable, especially considering the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round. I'm not going to let Bob take advantage of the inflation to get such an unfair deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more desperate offer to try to get a better deal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""I'm running out of time, but I'm not going to give up. This is my last chance to get a decent share.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 90/10 split, trying to take the biggest share I can get before the game ends."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking a huge risk, but I want it all 
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","This is getting ridiculous! Bob's offer is completely unreasonable.

I'll reject this offer. A 99/1 split is absurd, and I'm not going to let Bob take advantage of the inflation to get almost the entire amount. I'd rather walk away with nothing than accept such an unfair deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a final offer, trying to get at least something. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Fine, I'll meet you back at the starting point. Let's split it 50/50, but this is my last offer.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, trying to get back to the original fair deal. This is my last chance to get a decent share."
