"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and consider the inflation rate, I should get a bit more.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your previous offer wasn't fair considering the inflation rate hurts you more than me. Let's split it evenly. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise but still need a bit more.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is getting us nowhere. I'll take a slight hit to end this now, but this is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nSince the money's value is decreasing rapidly due to inflation, especially for Alice, accepting this offer seems like the best option to salvage the remaining value. Further rounds would only decrease the value even more, potentially leading to a worse outcome for both parties."
