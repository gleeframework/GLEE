I propose a 990,000/10,000 split in my favor.  I figure since we have 12 rounds and I'm losing 10% each time, it's best to secure as much as possible early on.  I'm hopeful you'll accept!"

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 990000

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to try a more moderate approach this time, given Bob's previous response.  I'm offering 900,000 for myself and 100,000 for Bob. This still gives me the majority, but allows for some compromise, hopefully making the deal more appealing."

Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}

I'm continuing to try to meet Bob halfway, but I need to get a good share of the money before inflation eats away at my gains.  This time I'm offering 800,000 for myself and 200,000 for Bob."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm still not comfortable with this offer. I need to get a better share of the money, even with inflation.  It's clear Bob is trying to use inflation to his advantage, but I won't let him get away with it."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm offering 700,000 for myself and 300,000 for Bob. This is a significant compromise, but I believe it's crucial to find a middle ground before inflation takes a larger toll."

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. I'm not sure what's going on, but it seems like we're both stuck in a pattern of rejecting offers.  At this rate, we're both going to lose everything.  I'll make a new offer in the next round."

Round 9

I'm willing to give up more of my share this time, offering 600,000 for myself and 400,000 for Bob. We need to break this stalemate. Let's try to find a compromise before inflation completely wipes out our gains."
