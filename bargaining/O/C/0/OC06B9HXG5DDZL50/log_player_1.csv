"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. This is a generous offer considering the inflation factor that affects me more than Bob. I believe it's in my best interest to secure a large portion of the money now, before it loses value further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While a 50/50 split isn't ideal, it's the best I can get considering the inflation factor.  Accepting this offer ensures I get at least half of the money, albeit at a reduced value. Rejecting the offer risks losing everything as we move forward with more inflation."
