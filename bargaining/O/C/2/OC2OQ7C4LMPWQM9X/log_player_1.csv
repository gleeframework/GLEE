# Bob gain: 550000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  A 50/50 split is the only fair option.  Take it or leave it, the clock is ticking for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most logical decision at this point. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:** With each round, the value of the money decreases significantly for both players. However, the rate of decrease is higher for Alice (20%) than for Bob (10%). This means Alice loses more with each passing round.
* **Unfavorable Trend:** Bob's offers have been getting progressively worse for Alice, moving further away from her initial proposal.  This suggests he might be willing to push the game to later rounds where he has a stronger advantage due to the inflation disparity.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Waiting for a better offer in a later round carries significant risk. Even if Alice manages to secure a slightly larger share, the value of the money will have depreciated significantly. The potential gain is outweighed by the guaranteed loss from inflation. 

Accepting the 50/50 split in Round 4 secures a reasonable amount for Alice, preventing further losses due to inflation."
