Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This is my initial offer. I'm aiming for a fair split, but I'm also aware of the inflation and want to secure a good portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

I'm adjusting my offer slightly to account for the inflation and Bob's previous rejection. I'm still aiming for a good portion of the money, but also want to make a compromise to avoid further rounds of negotiation and potential losses due to inflation."
