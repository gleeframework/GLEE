"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take 80 and you can take 20. Let's end the game here!""
}
```

This way, I get the majority of the money, but it's still a reasonable offer."

# Alice gain: 60

Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 60 is actually worth 90% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain of 40 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not sure if this is the best I can get, so I'll think about it for a moment...
