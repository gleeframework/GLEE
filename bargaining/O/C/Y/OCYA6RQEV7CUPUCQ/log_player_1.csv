"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

I'm starting with a fair and equal split, hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this new offer.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but the money Bob gains is worth 20% less, I'm actually getting a better deal than I would have in the first round, even though Bob is trying to take more.

I'll accept Bob's offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
