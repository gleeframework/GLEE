"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""
}
```

I'm offering to take 55% of the money, which I think is a reasonable starting point for the negotiation. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking a bit more this round, but I think it's fair given the shrinking value of the money. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for round 3:


{
  ""alice_gain"": 510000,
  ""bob_gain"": 490000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm being generous""
}


I've taken into account the reduced value of the money and made a slightly more conservative offer. Let's see if Bob is willing to accept it!"
