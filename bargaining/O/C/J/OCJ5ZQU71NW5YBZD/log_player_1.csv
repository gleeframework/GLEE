"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is a 60-40 split, which seems fair to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants a 50-50 split now. That's a bold move!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll stick to my original proposal of a 60-40 split. The money is still worth the same to me, so I'm not motivated to give up more of it."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With Bob's offer being a 50-50 split, I'm feeling a bit more generous. Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This is a 55.5-44.5 split, still a bit more in my favor, but closer to a 50-50 split than my original offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is taking its toll! Bob's offer is a 40-60 split now, and the money he gains is worth significantly less than it was in the first round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. The money I gain is worth the same as it was in the first round, so I'm not losing much by accepting this offer."
