Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 60% this time, leaving you with 40%.  It's a fair starting point for negotiation, and with the inflation, this is a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
