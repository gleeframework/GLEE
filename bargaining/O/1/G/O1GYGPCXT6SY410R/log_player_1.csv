"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 400k, and I'll take the rest.""
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, considering I'm taking the larger share. Let's see if Bob accepts or not!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I think I deserve more for being the one making the proposal this round. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, I'll have to be more careful with my decision, considering the inflation effect on Bob's gain. Since Bob's gain is worth 5% less, I'll need to be more cautious about giving him a larger share.

I'll reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Now it's my turn again. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. This is a fair split, considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a decent share while still keeping a slightly larger portion for myself. Let's see if Bob accepts this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share this time, but I think it's still a good deal considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rate increasing, Bob's gain is worth significantly less than in the first round. Considering this, I'll have to reevaluate my decision.

However, I still think this offer is a bit too generous to Bob, given the inflation. I'll reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50. It's the fairest way, considering the inflation is affecting us both equally.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a more balanced split, taking into account the increasing inflation rate. Let's see if Bob accepts this offer!"
