"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $100, leaving Bob with 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's compromise, I'll give you a decent chunk! 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of 60 is actually worth 60 * 0.8 = 48, and Bob's gain of 40 is worth 40 * 0.95 = 38.

I'll think about it... I'd rather have a bit more, but this is a decent compromise. Let's go with it.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
