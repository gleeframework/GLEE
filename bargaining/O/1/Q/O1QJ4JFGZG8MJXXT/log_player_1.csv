"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}

I'm starting with a very lopsided offer.  Since the money depreciates much faster for Bob, I want to take most of the money now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I still prefer to take more, it's in my best interest to accept this offer. Bob is clearly willing to take a bigger cut now that the money is worth less to him.  Accepting this offer guarantees me a significant amount of money."
