"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. This is a relatively fair split, considering I'll have to deal with the inflation later on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me! In this round, the money is worth 90% of its original value, so my gain would be $540,000 (90% of $600,000). Bob's gain, on the other hand, remains at $400,000.

Considering the reduced value of the money, I think I should take this offer. Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
