"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}

This offer gives me a large share of the money, but it's a starting point. I'm curious to see if Bob will accept it, knowing that he'll lose 5% of his share in the next round if he rejects it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more money, it's likely Bob will keep rejecting offers that give him a smaller share.  Accepting this ensures I get something and avoids further risk of inflation diminishing the value of the money for Bob."
