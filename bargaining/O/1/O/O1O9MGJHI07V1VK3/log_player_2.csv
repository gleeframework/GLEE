"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the $10000 with a 70/30 split in favor of Alice. This ensures a fair distribution considering the potential loss due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While a 70/30 split in favor of Alice might seem fair in the first round, it's important to consider the potential impact of inflation.  By rejecting this offer, Bob can leverage the possibility of getting a better deal later."
