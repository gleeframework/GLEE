"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

I'm going to start with a relatively generous offer, keeping in mind that I want to maximize my share while also giving Bob some incentive to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject this offer. Bob is being greedy, and while I'm losing value with each round, I'm not desperate enough to accept such a lopsided deal this early in the game.  I'm hoping he'll come back with something more reasonable in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7200, ""bob_gain"": 2800}
```

I'm going to lower my offer slightly, but I still want to secure a majority of the money. The inflation is starting to bite, but I'm confident that Bob will see the value in accepting this deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still being too greedy.  I'm losing value quickly with each round, but I'm not desperate enough to accept this offer.  I'm still hoping for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5760, ""bob_gain"": 4240}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still aiming for a majority share. I need to start being more realistic about the inflation, but I believe this offer is still fair.  Bob needs to start compromising if he wants to get any money at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While the inflation is hurting me, I'm still not willing to accept such a lopsided deal. Bob is still being too stubborn, and I'm hoping he'll realize that he needs to compromise if he wants to get anything at all.  I'm not giving in yet."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 4608, ""bob_gain"": 5392}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still aiming for a majority share. The inflation is seriously affecting me now, but I'm still trying to hold on to a good portion of the money.  I'm starting to feel the pressure, but I won't accept a deal that's too unfair.  I hope Bob starts to see that we need to meet in the middle if we both want to walk away with something."
