Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start by offering Bob a small amount, hoping he'll be greedy and reject it, giving me the opportunity to make a more favorable offer in the next round.  I'll see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get more, taking 4000 now is better than risking getting nothing at all.  The inflation will eat away at the value of the money if I keep rejecting offers.  I'll accept this one."
