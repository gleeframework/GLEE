"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can reassess as we go along.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting 60 dollars and Bob getting 40 dollars. I think this is a fair starting point, and we can adjust as needed based on future proposals."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's more fair to split the money evenly.  We can always adjust later if we both agree. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the uneven split, but I'm willing to consider it. Since Bob's offer is still worth 10% less to me than in the first round, I'll accept this offer.
