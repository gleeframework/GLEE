"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take a large share, but you'll get something to start with. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While it's tempting to accept something, it's better to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  The value of the money will decrease with each round, so it's worth pushing for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""message"": ""I'm willing to split the money more evenly.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still willing to take the majority, but let's get this done.  I'm willing to compromise a bit more.  
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice is offering more than in the first round, the value of the money for Bob has decreased significantly. It's still worth pushing for a fairer split, especially considering there are 9 rounds remaining."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 3000,
""alice_gain"": 7000,
""message"": ""I'm still looking for a more balanced split.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a bigger share to make this worthwhile for me.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to get concerned about the time. Let's compromise a little more.  I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share to avoid risking losing everything. 
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While the value of the money has decreased for Bob significantly,  Alice's offer is getting closer to a fair split, and accepting it is the best option at this point. The risk of losing everything by rejecting is too high, considering the decreasing value of the money."
