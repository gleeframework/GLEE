"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose to take 999,999$ and give Bob 1$.  Since the inflation is a factor, I'm aiming to get the most possible in the first round.  Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer to take more, it's clear that Bob is willing to take a much larger share than I initially offered.  Since inflation is a factor, accepting this offer is the best way to ensure I get a substantial amount of money."
