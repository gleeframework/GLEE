Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

# Alice's message: Okay, I'll compromise a little, but I'm still aiming for the bigger share. We only have 10 rounds left, so let's get this settled! 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm still not satisfied with this offer, Alice. I'm sure we can find a better solution."
