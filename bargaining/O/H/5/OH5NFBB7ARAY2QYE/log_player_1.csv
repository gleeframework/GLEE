"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $100, which is $40. I'll take the remaining $60. I'm hoping Bob will accept this fair offer and we can end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 50/50 is a good starting point. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 5% less, I need to consider the effect of inflation.

Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, which is a significant concession from his initial rejection of my 60/40 offer. Considering the inflation, I think this is a reasonable offer.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
