"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair.  I'll take 60%, you get 40%. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think 60/40 is a fair split, but I'm willing to negotiate.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time. We both lose value with each round, so a 50/50 split makes the most sense. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Even with the inflation, getting 5000 is better than potentially getting nothing."
