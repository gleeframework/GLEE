"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going for a large share in the first round.  Since the money inflates more for Bob than for me, I want to secure a larger portion early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It's a fair deal. While I get a smaller share than my initial proposal, it's better than risking nothing. With each round, my gains are guaranteed to decrease, and accepting ensures I get something."
