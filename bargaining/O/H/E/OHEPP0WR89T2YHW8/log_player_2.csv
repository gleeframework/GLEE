"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand this is a negotiation, Bob, but the clock is ticking louder for you than for me. I'm willing to be generous, but this offer factors in the increasing pressure due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 3600 
# Alice gain: 6400 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is correct that the clock is ticking louder for me, but she's still trying to take a significantly larger share.  While her offer is slightly better than her first, it's not moving fast enough to reflect the accelerating impact of inflation on my potential earnings. I need to signal I'm willing to walk away if she doesn't offer a more equitable deal soon."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, an even split might seem fair in a vacuum, but it doesn't account for the time pressure.  I'm holding firm on a deal that recognizes the shrinking value on your end. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough call, but I have to be realistic. Alice is playing hardball and seems unwilling to budge.  While her offer is far from ideal, rejecting it means risking getting even less in subsequent rounds due to the accelerating inflation working against me. Accepting now secures a disappointing but acceptable amount, which is better than walking away with nothing."
