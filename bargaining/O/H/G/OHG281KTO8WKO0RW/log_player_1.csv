Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

""alice_gain"": 5500,

Round 4

# Bob's message: Considering the increasing inflation impact on your side, I think this is a reasonable adjustment. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is taking advantage of the situation, but his offer is getting worse for me each round.  I need to hold out for a better deal while being mindful that time is running out."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic.  The clock is ticking, and this is the most straightforward path to both of us getting something.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency:**  Five rounds have passed. Emphasizing the shrinking pot due to inflation is crucial.
* **Fairness:** A 50/50 split, while not ideal given the inflation against Alice, is increasingly attractive compared to letting time run out.
* **Directness:** Bob needs to understand that continually pushing for a larger share might leave him with nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the significant impact of inflation on your share, I'm willing to take a bit more to ensure I get a decent amount, but still offering you something. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to take advantage of the situation. While time is running out, accepting this offer would mean a significant loss for me. It's a risk, but I need to push for a better deal in the hopes that Bob understands the urgency and that getting something is better than nothing."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""Bob, this is a compromise.  I need you to meet me halfway. We both lose if this goes on.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** With only 5 rounds left, the pressure is on.  A deal needs to be reached soon.
* **Concession:** Alice is slightly increasing her previous offer, acknowledging the need to incentivize Bob.
* **Urgency:** The message emphasizes that failure to agree is a loss for both parties. While not ideal for Alice, it's a realistic attempt given the circumstances."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is severely impacting your share, and we're running out of time. This is a realistic offer considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is getting dangerous, but Bob's offer is getting worse! He's clearly banking on me panicking as the rounds go on. I need to hold my ground, the next offer is crucial. If he doesn't budge significantly next round, I'll likely have to accept a bad deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is it. Take it or leave it. We're down to the wire and this is the best you'll get.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Ultimatum:**  This is it. Bob needs to understand there's no more time for games. 
* **Slight Concession:**  Alice is meeting Bob closer to his previous offer, but it's still more than he initially proposed.
* **Urgency:** The message is blunt. It conveys the severity of the situation.  Delay means zero gain for both."
