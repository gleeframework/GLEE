"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, I'll be generous""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. I'm framing it as a generous offer to try to get him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a fair share, but I'm not being too generous 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll have to consider the reduced value of the money due to inflation. Since my gain is worth 5% less, I'll calculate the effective value of the offer:

My gain: 300,000 / 0.95 (1 - 0.05) = 315,789.47

Not a bad offer, considering the reduced value of the money. I'll accept it.
