This is a tough one, and it hinges on reading Alice and understanding the risk.  Here's why I'm still holding out:

* **Alice is playing aggressively:**  She keeps pushing for a larger share, knowing the inflation hurts me more each round.
* **But, she hasn't walked away:** If she was truly unwilling to compromise, she could've ended the game already. This implies she wants *something*.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Accepting now guarantees me something, but it's a lot less than I want. I'm betting she'll get more reasonable as the rounds dwindle.

It's a gamble, but I think Alice will break before I do."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value fast! 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is frustrating, but I need to cut my losses.  Here's why:

* **Alice is clearly willing to play hardball:** She's not budging much, and the pressure is on me now.
* **The inflation is killing me:**  Every round that passes makes the potential gains significantly smaller. Waiting any longer is too risky.
* **Something is better than nothing:** 35% is far from ideal, but if this keeps going, I risk getting zero in the end.

It's a bitter pill to swallow, but better to take a smaller share now than risk getting nothing at all."
