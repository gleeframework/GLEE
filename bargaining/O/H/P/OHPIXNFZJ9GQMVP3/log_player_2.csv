**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate, and her offers are getting worse for her due to the faster inflation she's experiencing. It's risky, but we can likely squeeze out a better deal in the next couple of rounds."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""This is ridiculous.  We're running out of time. I'm offering a 50/50 split. Take it or leave it, but this is my final offer.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I could try to push for more, the risk of getting nothing is increasing significantly. Alice is clearly stubborn, but this offer is fair and gives her a chance to salvage something before inflation eats away at her share even more.  The strong message might also nudge her to accept."
