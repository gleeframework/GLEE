"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 50/50, a fair start! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
I'm going to see if I can get a better deal. I know there's inflation to consider, but I'm going to try to get more than half."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I think we can do better than 50/50. Let's try a 60/40 split, with me getting 60% since I'm taking the risk of proposing.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you 40% since you didn't take the first offer. You can't have it all! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll accept this offer. While it's less than what I proposed, the inflation has already reduced the value of the money considerably.  It's better to take 40% now than risk getting nothing."
