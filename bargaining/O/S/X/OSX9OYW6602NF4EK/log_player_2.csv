Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but 60/40 is too much in your favor. Let's split it 55/45, and we can move on. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher percentage, accepting a 55/45 split in Round 3 is strategically sound. Here's why:

* **Time Value of Money:**  The longer the game goes, the less the money is worth. Accepting now secures a decent amount.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a better deal risks getting a worse offer later, especially if Alice senses my desperation as we approach round 12.
* **Fairness:**  While not ideal, 55/45 is a reasonable compromise and significantly better than her initial 90/10 proposal."
