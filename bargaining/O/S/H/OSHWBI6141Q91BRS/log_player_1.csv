"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering to split the $10,000 evenly between us, with each of us getting $5,000. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, given the inflation risk.  What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation risk, I think Bob's proposal is a bit too skewed towards him. I'd rather take a smaller share now and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share to account for the risk of inflation. Your turn!""
}
```"
