This is a tough one, but I have to accept. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The longer this goes on, the less my share is actually worth. 
* **Alice's Strategy:**  She knows I'm getting hurt by inflation and seems content to wait me out for a slightly better deal.
* **Future Uncertainty:** There's no guarantee she'll offer me anything close to this in future rounds. 

While I'd prefer a 50/50 split, getting only $43 is better than risking even less in later rounds."
