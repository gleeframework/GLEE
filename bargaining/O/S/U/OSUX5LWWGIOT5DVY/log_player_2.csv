"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's tempting to get something, I believe I can negotiate a better deal for myself, especially given the inflation factor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}
``` 

I'm going to offer Alice $400,000 and keep $600,000 for myself. This is a fair split, and I believe it's in both our best interests to reach an agreement early on."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still very unfair.  While the inflation factor is hurting me, I'm still holding out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}
``` 

I'm offering a 50/50 split.  This is the fairest way to divide the money, and it's a good compromise given the circumstances."
