I'm offering a 90/10 split in my favor.  I figure this is a good starting point, as it leaves a decent amount for Bob while still giving me the majority of the money.  Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being greedy, trying to flip the script completely. I'm not going to accept this offer, I'll make my own proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm still aiming for a majority share, but I'm willing to compromise a bit.  This offer is closer to a 70/30 split. Bob got greedy in the last round, hopefully this is more appealing to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still being stubborn. This offer is only slightly better than his last one. I'm not going to cave, I'll make a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm reducing my share again, but only by 100,000.  I'm hoping to show Bob that I'm serious about negotiation, but I won't give in to his unreasonable demands."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too close to a 50/50 split.  He's barely budging, and inflation is eating away at our gains.  I need to hold firm and get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

I'm making a final concession, lowering my share to 550,000. Bob has shown he's not willing to compromise much, but this is still a good deal for both of us. If he rejects it, we'll both lose more to inflation and risk getting nothing."
