5800.0,4200.0,"Bob, time is running out.  I'll take a slight hit from my last offer, 5800 for me and 4200 for you. This is our last chance for a clean deal, otherwise, inflation will erode even more of our potential gains.",Alice,3,

4500.0,5500.0,"You're getting closer, but I still think we can do better than that. How about a 55/45 split in my favor?",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5200.0,4800.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Accept this 52/48 split in my favor, or the deal's off. The inflation is killing us both at this point, and I won't go any lower.",Alice,5,

5000.0,5000.0,"You've come a long way, but I still think I can get a bit more. How about we meet in the middle at a 50/50 split again?",Bob,6,
