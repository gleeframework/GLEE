I'm taking a greedy approach here. I'll give Bob just 1% of the money, knowing that inflation will work in my favor in the later rounds.  Let's see what Bob does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still pretty generous to him, and while I would like to see more for myself, I am confident that I can get a better deal in the next round. Inflation is working in my favor!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm raising my share a bit, but still leaving a significant portion for Bob.  The inflation is starting to kick in, so I want to secure a larger share before it becomes too much of an issue for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 190000 
# Bob gain: 810000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation is hitting Bob hard.  His offer is getting increasingly worse with each round, and if I keep rejecting, I risk ending up with nothing.  It's time to take this offer and secure something for myself."
