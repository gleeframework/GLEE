"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
``` 

I propose a 50/50 split. This seems like the fairest starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48}
``` 

I'm willing to offer a slightly better deal for Bob than the previous round, but still maintain a majority share for myself, given the inflation effect."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While the inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money, it's better to accept this offer than risk a further decrease in value with another round."
