Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

This is a 50-50 split, which is a fair starting point. Let's see what Bob thinks!"

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 10% less, I think I can do better than this offer.

I'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round.

Round 3

  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
