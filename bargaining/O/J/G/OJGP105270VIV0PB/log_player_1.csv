"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let us divide fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI am offering Bob $4000 and keeping $6000 for myself, with the message ""Let us divide fairly"". I am trying to be generous while also getting a larger share, as I have the advantage of not being affected by inflation. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest way. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI am rejecting Bob's offer to split the money evenly. Since Bob is affected by inflation and I am not, I believe I have the upper hand in this negotiation. I can try to get a better deal in the next round. Additionally, Bob's offer of an even split does not take into account the fact that the money is worth less to him due to inflation, so I think I can do better. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a good deal for you""}\n\nIn this round, I am offering Bob $3500 and keeping $6500 for myself. Given that the money is worth 20% less to Bob due to inflation, I believe this offer is still relatively generous. I am trying to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth less to Bob, while also trying to find a mutually acceptable agreement. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bigger share to make it worth it after inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI am rejecting Bob's offer again. Although Bob is trying to compromise, I still believe I can get a better deal. The fact that the money is worth 48.8% less to Bob due to inflation means that his $4500 is actually worth much less in real terms. Meanwhile, my $5500 is still worth the full amount. I think I can push for an even better deal in the next round, so I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal. Let's proceed!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""Inflation is taking its toll, this is a good deal considering""}\n\nIn this round, I am offering Bob $3000 and keeping $7000 for myself. Given that the money is worth 48.8% less to Bob due to inflation, I believe this offer is still relatively reasonable. I am trying to drive a harder bargain, as I think Bob may be getting desperate to reach an agreement before the money becomes even less valuable to him. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to accept a smaller share than before, but inflation is making this difficult.  Let's find a middle ground. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI am accepting Bob's offer. Although I have been trying to drive a hard bargain, I think this offer is reasonable considering the effects of inflation on Bob's share. With the money being worth 67.23% less to Bob, his $4000 is actually worth much less in real terms. Meanwhile, my $6000 is still worth the full amount. Given that we are already in Round 6 and the game has a limited number of rounds, I think it's time to reach an agreement. I don't want to risk Bob walking away and both of us getting nothing, so I'll accept this offer and end the game."
