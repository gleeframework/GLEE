"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable given that we're starting with a large amount of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll try to negotiate from here 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round.

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You're trying to meet me in the middle, but I think I can do better than that.""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 64% of its original value (80% * 80% = 64%) due to the two rounds of inflation, I'll make a new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to give up too much.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a slightly better deal and holding onto as much value as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not giving up enough, I'll take a smaller share this time 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 51.2% of its original value (100% - 48.8% = 51.2%) due to the four rounds of inflation, I'll consider Bob's new offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You're trying to flip the script, but I think I can still do better than that.""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 42.24% of its original value (51.2% * 0.82 = 42.24%) due to the five rounds of inflation, I'll make a new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 525000,
  ""bob_gain"": 475000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much ground.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a slightly better deal and holding onto as much value as possible, considering the increasing inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to get desperate, but I'll hold firm on this 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 32.77% of its original value (100% - 67.23% = 32.77%) due to the six rounds of inflation, I'll consider Bob's new offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You're trying to squeeze the last bit out of me, but I think I can still do better than that.""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further, hoping to salvage what's left of the original value."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 26.21% of its original value (32.77% * 0.8 = 26.21%) due to the seven rounds of inflation, I'll make a new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""It's getting late, let's meet in the middle and end this game before it's too late.""
}
```

I'm trying to be more conciliatory and propose a 50-50 split, hoping to end the game on a more equal note."
