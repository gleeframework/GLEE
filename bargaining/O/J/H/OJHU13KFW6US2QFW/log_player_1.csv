"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $45 and taking $55 for myself, with a message suggesting that this is a relatively fair division. Since the value of money doesn't decrease for me but does for Bob with each round, I'm starting with a slightly higher offer for myself to take advantage of this dynamic. The message aims to psychologically nudge Bob into considering this as a reasonable offer, potentially leading to an early acceptance and maximizing my gain before the value of money starts to decrease for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time, I think it's the fairest way to go. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, given the inflation dynamic, an even split in the second round is not as advantageous to me as it would have been in the first round. The value of the money hasn't decreased for me, but it has for Bob. By rejecting this offer, I aim to leverage this advantage in subsequent rounds, pushing for a division that favors me more significantly as the value of the money Bob receives continues to decrease."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, this is more than fair now""}\n\nIn this round, I'm increasing my proposed share to $60, with Bob receiving $40. Given that the value of money decreases by 5% for Bob each round, his $40 in this round is worth less than the $45 I offered him initially and significantly less than the $50 he offered in the second round. My message aims to remind Bob of the impact of inflation on his earnings, suggesting that accepting this offer is prudent as the value of his potential gains will only continue to decrease in subsequent rounds."
