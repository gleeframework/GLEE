6000.0,4000.0,Let's be fair and split it 60-40. It's a good deal for both of us!,Alice,1,

4500.0,5500.0,"I understand you want a fair share, but I need to plan for the future. How about a 55/45 split?",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
6500.0,3500.0,"You didn't like my first offer, and I didn't like yours. Considering the inflation, I think this 65-35 split is more than fair.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Alice, let's stop wasting time. This back and forth helps neither of us. I propose a 50/50 split - it's the fairest and ensures we both benefit before inflation eats away at the value.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
7000.0,3000.0,"I understand your desire for a 50/50 split, but considering the significant impact of inflation on your share, I think this 70-30 split is more realistic.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Alice, this is getting out of hand.  I'm offering a 45/55 split. This is a compromise and a realistic offer considering the inflation.  Let's be logical and end this before we both lose out.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
7500.0,2500.0,"I understand you think your offer is realistic, but with the inflation, your share is worth less than a third of its original value. This 75-25 split reflects the current situation.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
6000.0,4000.0,"Alice, this is getting absurd.  I'm offering you the 60/40 split you originally wanted.  Take it before inflation makes this entire endeavor pointless!",Bob,8,
