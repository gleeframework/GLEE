"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and straightforward offer. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent chunk, but I'm not giving up too much. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting Bob's gain, his 70$ is actually worth 65.25$ (since 95% of 73.33$ is 70$). 

My gain of 30$ is still worth 30$. 

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the large disparity in gains. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 90% of its original value after two rounds of inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes this into account. 

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I still want a decent share""
}
```

I'm offering a 40/60 split, which is a bit more generous than my initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I still want a bit more for my efforts. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting Bob's gain, his 55$ is actually worth 46.88$ (since 85.74% of 64.44$ is 55$). 

My gain of 45$ is still worth 45$. 

This offer is closer to my initial offer, but I still think I'm giving up a bit too much. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 84.48% of its original value after four rounds of inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes this into account. 

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 42,
  ""bob_gain"": 58,
  ""message"": ""I'm not budging much, but I'm willing to meet you halfway""
}
```

I'm offering a 42/58 split, which is a bit more in my favor, but still a reasonable compromise."
