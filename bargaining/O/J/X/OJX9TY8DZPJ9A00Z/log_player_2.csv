"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'd like to propose a counteroffer, but since I have to reject first, I'll do that. Considering the 20% inflation, I think I can get a better deal. Let's see what happens next!\n\n###\nPlease proceed with the next round. I'm excited to make my proposal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\nI'll make a counteroffer that takes into account the 20% inflation. Since the money is worth less to me now, I'll try to get a larger share. Here's my proposal:\n\n###\n{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I think this is a fairer split.""}\n\n###\nLet's see what Alice thinks!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This offer still gives you a good share, Bob, but time is running out. Let's be reasonable and close the deal. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'll reject this offer as well. Although the money is worth 36% less to me now, I think I can still negotiate a better deal. Alice seems willing to make concessions, so I'll try to push for a bit more. Let's see what happens next!\n\n###\nPlease proceed with the next round. I'm excited to make another proposal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 6500, ""alice_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""Inflation is taking its toll on me. I need a bigger share to make up for it.""}\n\n###\nLet's see if Alice is willing to accept this offer!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  Take this offer before inflation eats away at your share even more! 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on my share, I think it's time to accept this offer. The difference between this offer and my previous proposal is relatively small, and further negotiations might not yield a better result. I'll take the 4800 dollars, which is still a decent amount despite the inflation.\n\n###\nLet's conclude the game here! It was a fun negotiation!"
