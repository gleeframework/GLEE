6000.0,4000.0,Let's start with this. It's a fair deal for both of us.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the inflation rates we'll be dealing with.  Let's get this done in the first round.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Okay, let's find a middle ground. This offer accounts for the inflation affecting us both.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Let's split this evenly. We're both losing value with each round, so a 50/50 split is the most reasonable solution at this point.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5200.0,4800.0,"Bob, we're both losing out with each passing round. This is a slight improvement on my previous offer and gives us both a bit more than a 50/50 split would at this point.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
4800.0,5200.0,"Alice, we're both losing money rapidly.  This is a fair compromise that slightly favors me due to the much higher inflation rate I'm facing.  Let's accept this and move on.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Bob, it's clear we both want a bit more than the other is willing to give. Let's be realistic, take the 50/50 split and avoid losing even more to inflation.",Alice,7,
