"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 80% and you can take 20%""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 60% and keep 40% for myself. It's a decent compromise. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of 6000 is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, which is still a decent amount. However, I'm not sure if I want to settle for 60% of the remaining amount. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a higher percentage to account for the decreasing value of money. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take 70% and you can take 30%. It's a fair compromise considering the inflation.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 65% and keep 35% for myself. It's a bit more generous than your offer, but I think it's a good compromise. 
# Alice gain: 6500 
# Bob gain: 3500 
Do you accept this offer?","The offers are getting closer, but I'm still not convinced. With the inflation rate, my gain of 6500 is worth significantly less than what I initially wanted. I'll reject this offer and try to push for a better deal.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation taking a bigger hit, I'll aim for an even higher percentage to compensate for the loss in value. Here's my offer:

  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""I'll take 75% and you can take 25%. It's the best I can do considering the inflation.""
