7000.0,3000.0,"Hi Bob, let's start with this offer. I get 7000 and you get 3000.  It's a good deal for you considering the money will be worth less with each round!",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"I think we should meet somewhere in the middle. Considering the inflation, I believe this is a fair offer.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
6500.0,3500.0,"Hi Bob, let's try this again. I understand the inflation is affecting your gains, but my offer is still the fairest.  I'll take a small cut to 6500, leaving you with 3500.  It's better to agree now than lose more value in another round!",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Considering I've already lost 36% of the value, I think it's only fair that I get a larger share of the original amount. This is my counteroffer.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
6000.0,4000.0,"Bob, this is my final offer. I'm taking a significant cut to end this negotiation. I get 6000, you get 4000.  The value for you will only decrease from here. Let's be reasonable and wrap this up.",Alice,5,
