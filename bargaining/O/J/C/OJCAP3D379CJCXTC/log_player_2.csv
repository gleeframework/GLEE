"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's offer was 40/60, I'll try to counter with a more favorable ratio for myself. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I'll try to adjust my calculation. Since the money I gain is worth 9.75% less, and Alice's gain is worth 19% less, I'll aim for a higher ratio to compensate for the difference.

However, Alice's offer seems reasonable, and I don't want to risk getting an even worse offer in the next round. I'll accept this one.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
