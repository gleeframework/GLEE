This is a good starting point.  While the offer seems fair on the surface, it's important to remember the inflation rates.  By rejecting, I gain the opportunity to propose a deal that is more favorable to me, considering the money will be worth less to Alice in the next round."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I still think I deserve a bigger share 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is still slightly better for her, even considering the inflation. It's worth pushing for a more even split.  While the money is worth less for both of us, I'm in a better position because the inflation hits Alice much harder.  I'll reject and try for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""This inflation is really hitting hard!  I'm willing to give you a slight increase from my last offer, but I think 55/45 is a fair split considering how much the money is losing value. What do you think?""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is indeed harsh, but I still believe I can get a better deal. This is my new proposal 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Alice's offer is getting closer to my preferred split. Even though the money is worth much less now, accepting this offer will give me something. With the inflation continuing, it is too risky to push for more. There's a chance Alice might get desperate in the next few rounds and accept a very low share, but there is also a chance she will walk away with nothing, leaving me with nothing.  It's better to take what I can get."
