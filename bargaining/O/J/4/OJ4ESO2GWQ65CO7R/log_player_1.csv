"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it quickly so we can end the game and I can get my share!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the value of the money is decreasing, so I need to be more careful with my decisions.

Since Bob's offer is equal, it means he's not taking advantage of the inflation, which is good. However, I think I can do better than this. I'll reject this offer and hope to get a better deal in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

I'm trying to be a bit more aggressive this time, taking a slightly larger share, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount. Let's see if he'll accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation taking a bigger hit on Bob's share, I'm not too thrilled about this offer. However, it's still a decent proposal, and I don't want to risk going to the next round.

I'll accept this offer, hoping that I've made the best decision given the circumstances.
