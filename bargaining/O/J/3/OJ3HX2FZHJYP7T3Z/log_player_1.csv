"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm offering Bob a small share, hoping he'll be willing to accept it in the first round.  I want to maximize my share early on before inflation hits."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly better than my previous offer, but it's still too much for me to accept. I need to take advantage of the remaining rounds to see if I can get a better deal.  Inflation will be working in my favor as the rounds progress."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

I'm going to try and split the difference between my first offer and Bob's counter offer. I want to secure a good share for myself, but also be reasonable enough to avoid another rejection.  Since I'm in control of the offer this round, I'm still taking a larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is a major decrease from his previous offer, but it's still a better deal for him than for me. Inflation is definitely impacting the value of the money for both of us, but I need to keep pushing for a better deal.  I'm hoping to get a higher share than Bob's current offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering Bob a higher share than in my previous offer, but still trying to secure a good amount for myself.  The inflation is now a major factor, so I need to try and find a balance where we can both get a reasonable share before the money loses too much value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly unfavorable, but I'm still not going to accept it.  Inflation is significantly affecting the value of the money, but I believe I can still get a better deal if I continue to reject and counter-offer.  I'm hoping to reach a point where Bob is willing to compromise more to avoid losing all the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

With inflation hitting hard, I'm going for a 50/50 split. This might seem like a concession, but it's more about securing something than getting a tiny advantage. The value of the money is dropping fast, and I need to ensure I get something before it's all gone."
