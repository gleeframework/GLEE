"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good split. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better offer. The 5% inflation rate for me is a concern, but I think I can get more than 40%. Let's proceed to the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll try to negotiate for a better split. Since the money is worth 5% less for me in each round, I'll aim for a higher amount to compensate for the loss.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering I don't lose value, 58-42 is reasonable. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll reject this offer as well. Although the money is worth 9.75% less for me now, I still think I can get a better deal. Alice's offer of 58-42 is not significantly better than her initial offer, and I'm willing to take another round to try and get closer to my target.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll try to find a middle ground that takes into account the decreasing value of the money for me. Since Alice's last offer was 58-42, I'll aim for a split that is slightly more in my favor.

{""bob_gain"": 52,
""alice_gain"": 48,
""message"": ""Given the increasing inflation, I think 52-48 is a reasonable compromise.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation affects you more, 57-43 is a better split. 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll accept this offer. Considering the money is now worth 18.55% less for me, I think 57-43 is a reasonable split. The difference between this offer and my last proposal is relatively small, and I don't think I can get a significantly better deal in the next round.
