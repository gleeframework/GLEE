"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, you can propose next""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. I'm leaving room for him to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer.  Let's see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering the new offer, I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think a 60/40 split is fair, especially considering the initial offer was 4:1 in my favor. I'll try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth 40% less now due to inflation.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair and equal share""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping to meet Bob in the middle and avoid further negotiations."
