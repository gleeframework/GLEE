Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 460000 
# Alice gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:** While I lost value on my earnings (36% less), Alice lost value too (19% less).  This means her offer is now more favorable to me.
* **Negotiation:** This is a better deal than what I proposed in the previous round, and it's close to my initial desired outcome of 600,000.  

By accepting, I ensure I get a decent share, even with inflation."
