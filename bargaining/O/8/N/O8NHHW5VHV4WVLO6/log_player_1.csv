"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the original $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effects of inflation, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, I'll aim for a higher share to compensate for the loss in value. However, Bob's offer is still quite generous, and I don't want to risk going to the next round.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
