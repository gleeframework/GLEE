"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping to set a fair tone for the negotiations. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take the majority! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take the majority! 

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll have to consider the inflation effect on Bob's gain. With 5% less value, Bob's gain is effectively worth 95% of the original amount.

Considering this, I'll decide to reject Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was for a 60/40 split, I'll try to counter with a 60/40 split in my favor this time. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""You wanted the majority, now it's my turn!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, I'll take a smaller majority! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to find a compromise! 

Let's calculate the effective value of Bob's gain, taking into account the inflation of 14.26%. This means Bob's gain is worth approximately 85.74% of the original amount.

Considering this, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject the offer. Since my gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll think carefully about the trade-off.

After considering the offer, I'll decide to reject Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was for a 70/30 split, I'll try to counter with a 55/45 split this time. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's find a compromise!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking a big risk, but I think I can get a better deal! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is taking a bold move!

Let's calculate the effective value of Bob's gain, taking into account the inflation of 22.62%. This means Bob's gain is worth approximately 77.38% of the original amount.

Considering this, I'll have to think carefully about the trade-off. Since my gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll weigh the risks and benefits. Accepting this offer would mean I'd be getting a significantly lower amount than I could have in previous rounds, but it's still a substantial sum.

After considering the offer, I'll decide to reject Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was for an 80/20 split, I'll try to counter with a 40/60 split this time. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""bob_gain"": 600000,
  ""message"": ""Let's give you a bigger share, but I'm not going to give up too much!""
}
