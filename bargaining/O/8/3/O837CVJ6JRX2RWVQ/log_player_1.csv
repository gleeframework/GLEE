This offer gives Alice the majority of the money, leaving Bob with a small amount.  It's a risky strategy, but it aims to secure a large share of the money quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
