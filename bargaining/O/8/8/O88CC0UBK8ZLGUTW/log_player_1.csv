"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! I'll give you 10% and keep 90%. It's a fair start.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000. I'm framing it as a generous offer to get the game started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to be careful.

I'll analyze Bob's offer:

* My gain would be $500,000, which is worth 80% of the original amount ($1,000,000 * 0.8 = $800,000).
* Bob's gain would be $500,000, which is worth 90% of the original amount ($1,000,000 * 0.9 = $900,000).

Considering the inflation, I think Bob's offer is actually a good one, and I'm willing to accept it.
