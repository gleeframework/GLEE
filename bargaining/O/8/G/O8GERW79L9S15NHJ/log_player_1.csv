"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll take 80% of the initial amount. Will you accept?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share to see if he'll accept quickly, but I'm also keeping a significant portion for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 60% and leave 40% for you. Is that fair? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation, my gain of 4000 is now worth 80% of the original 4000, or 3200. This is a significant reduction.

Considering Bob's offer, I think I can do better. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer.

```
