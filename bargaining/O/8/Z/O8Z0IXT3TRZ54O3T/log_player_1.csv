"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $10,000, which is $6,000, and leaving $4,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, let's start with a compromise 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a toll!

Considering the new offer from Bob, I'll calculate the actual amounts I'll receive after the 20% reduction due to inflation:

My gain: $5,000 x 0.8 = $4,000
Bob's gain: $5,000 x 0.8 = $4,000

This offer seems reasonable, and I'm not sure if I'll get a better deal in the next round. I'll accept this offer.
