Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your initial offer was a bit too far off for me. Let's be fair - this split is much closer to even and gives us both a reasonable amount. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
