Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept it and we can finish the game quickly."

# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 10% less, I'm not as eager to give up as much as I was in the first round. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate for a better deal.
