4000.0,6000.0,"I think a more even split is fair, considering we both lose value over time.  Let's start with this.",Bob,2,
,,"I appreciate the sentiment, Bob, but that's a significant shift in your favor. Let's try to find a middle ground.",Alice,2,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Okay, Bob, let's meet closer to the middle. This offer acknowledges the time pressure while still being a bit more advantageous for me due to the higher inflation I face.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"I'm willing to compromise, but I think a split closer to 50/50 is fair considering the diminishing value of the money. Let's try this.",Bob,4,
,,"Bob, we're running out of time, and this offer still disproportionately favors you. I'm willing to be flexible, but not at the cost of a significant loss for myself.",Alice,4,reject
5200.0,4800.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm offering a compromise - slightly better for me than a 50/50 split to account for the faster inflation hitting me.  Take it or leave it, we're running out of time!",Alice,5,
