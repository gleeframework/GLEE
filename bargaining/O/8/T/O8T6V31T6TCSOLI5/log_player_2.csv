"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. Take 10% this time, and I'll be more generous later. 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer is heavily skewed in Alice's favor. While she's promising to be ""more generous later"", there's no guarantee of that. It's better to push for a more equitable split early on, especially considering the inflation working against me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 70,
""alice_gain"": 30,
""message"": ""That offer was too low, Alice. I'm proposing a more realistic split considering we both want to leave with something.  Let's be reasonable and avoid wasting rounds.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better deal than that.  Let's split it closer to 60/40 this time.  We can work something out. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice's offer is getting better, but it's still not a great deal for me.  The inflation is working against her, so she's feeling the pressure to make a deal. I think I can push for a slightly better split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Okay Alice, let's meet in the middle.  60/40 is my final offer. Time is ticking, and neither of us wants to walk away empty-handed.""
}
