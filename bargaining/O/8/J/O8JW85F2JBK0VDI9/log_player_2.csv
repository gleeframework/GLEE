Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Consider the inflation, this is a better deal for you than the last one. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500

Round 4

""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest deal given the inflation.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You should accept this before the money loses more value for you. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While the offer is unfavorable, it's the best option at this point due to inflation severely diminishing my potential gains in future rounds. Accepting ensures I get something, rather than risking getting nothing in a later round."
