"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn to respond!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000 and leaving $2,000 for Bob. This way, we both get a decent share and can negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is a good compromise. Your turn to respond! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less now, my gain of $5,000 is equivalent to $4,500 in the first round's value.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with a 50/50 split, considering I was initially offered a smaller share. However, I don't want to reject it outright. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm comfortable with a 50/50 split, but I'm willing to consider other proposals. Let's negotiate further!""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less again, my gain of $5,000 is now equivalent to $4,500 in the first round's value, and $4,500 in the current round's value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share. Your turn to respond!""
}
```

I'm offering to take a smaller share, but still trying to negotiate a better deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I still think I deserve a bit more. Your turn to respond! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 27.1% less now, my gain of $4,000 is equivalent to $2,913 in the first round's value.

I'm not sure I'm happy with this offer, considering I was initially offered a larger share. However, I don't want to reject it without considering the current state of the economy. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this offer, but I'm willing to negotiate further. Can we discuss a different split?""

Your turn, Bob!"

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 2500,
  ""bob_gain"": 7500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a smaller share, but I think I'm getting close to a reasonable compromise. Your turn to respond!""
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive in this offer, taking a smaller share in the hopes that Bob will accept and we can finalize the deal."
