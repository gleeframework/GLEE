Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.

# Alice's message: Okay, I'll give you a little more this time.  I'm still hoping for a quick resolution, so let's do 70/30.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting tired of this game, Bob.  Let's split it 60/40, with me taking the larger share.  Accept and we can both get out of this with something. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000

``` 

While not ideal, accepting a 40/60 split at this stage is better than risking getting nothing if we continue to haggle. The effects of inflation are becoming significant, and it's better to secure something rather than nothing.
