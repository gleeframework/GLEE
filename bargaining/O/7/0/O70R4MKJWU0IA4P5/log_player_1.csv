Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

 I propose to keep $90 and give Bob $10.  I want to maximize my share in the first round, as the money will be worth less for Bob in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more money, Bob's offer is still better than if we keep going.  In the next round, the money I receive would be worth the same, but the money Bob receives would be worth even less due to inflation. This means he is more likely to offer me an even worse deal in the future. It's better to accept now and get something than risk getting nothing later."
