# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, how about a compromise?  I'll come down a bit to $5500, and you get $4500.  This feels like a fair deal considering the time pressure and inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500
