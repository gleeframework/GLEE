"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}

I'm going for a very lopsided offer in the first round.  I want to see how greedy Bob is.  Since we both get nothing if we don't agree within 12 rounds, I'm willing to risk a rejection to try and get the most I can early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While it's painful to take a loss, I'm accepting Bob's offer.  He's being very aggressive, and I'm not sure how much further the inflation will hurt me.  Taking 20% now is better than risking getting nothing in the end."
