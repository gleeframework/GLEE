Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're both losing money each round, let's try to be reasonable. I'm willing to concede a bit, but I need a bigger share to make it worth my while. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit my disadvantage with inflation. While the offer is better than her first one, accepting now would still give her the vast majority of the money. I need to show her I'm serious about getting a fairer share and willing to let the game progress (and inflation worsen) to get it."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Time is money, Alice, and we're both losing. 60/40 is fair and gives us both a good chunk. Let's close this out.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Conceding but firm:** I'm coming down from my previous offer to show flexibility, but I'm holding firm to a significant portion (60%).
* **Highlighting time pressure:**  Reminding Alice that delaying hurts both of us due to inflation keeps the pressure on.
* **Simple and direct:** The 60/40 split is easy to understand and positions the deal as mutually beneficial."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not sure what your strategy is, Bob, but this is getting ridiculous. We're both losing money, and I'm willing to be more flexible, but I need a bigger share than that. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is slowly creeping up, but it's still heavily skewed in her favor. She's trying to use psychological tactics by questioning my strategy and emphasizing the losses, but the reality is, the longer we wait, the more the inflation hurts *me*, not her. I need to signal I'm willing to play this out to later rounds if necessary to get a better deal."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Okay, Alice, let's be real. You know the longer this goes, the worse it gets for me, and we BOTH walk away with nothing. 55/45 is generous, and it ends this now.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight concession, firm stance:** I'm lowering my demand slightly again, showing a willingness to negotiate, but 55/45 is my bottom line for this stage of the game. 
* **Direct and blunt:** The message cuts through the pleasantries and lays out the stakes clearly. Alice knows the situation; there's no need to sugarcoat.
* **Implied ultimatum:** By framing the 55/45 offer as ""generous"" and emphasizing the ""walk away with nothing"" outcome, I'm subtly putting the pressure on her to accept before the stakes get even higher for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're both losing out here. I'm starting to think you're just playing games. I'm willing to go lower than my previous offers, but I need a decent share to justify this. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough one. Alice's offer is getting closer to a reasonable split, and the inflation is starting to bite. However, she's also using psychological tactics, accusing me of ""playing games.""  This suggests she might be getting nervous and could be more open to a favorable deal for me in the next round or two. 

I need to hold my ground a bit longer and see if she'll crack. Accepting now would mean settling for significantly less, and I think I can still get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Enough games, Alice. 50/50. Take it or leave it. We're running out of time.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **The Ultimatum:**  At this stage, with inflation eating into my share and time running out, a firm 50/50 split is the strongest play. 
* **Projecting Strength:**  The message is direct, bordering on blunt. It shows Alice I'm serious and removes any doubt about my willingness to walk away.
* **Leveraging Time Pressure:** By emphasizing the shrinking clock (""running out of time""), I'm adding weight to the ultimatum. Alice knows another rejection brings us closer to zero for both of us.

**This strategy is risky**, as Alice might call my bluff. However, it's a calculated risk based on:

* **Alice's reluctance to settle for less:** Her offers have been steadily increasing, indicating she wants a deal.
* **The rapidly approaching deadline:**  Both of us lose everything if we don't agree soon. This creates strong pressure for her to accept a reasonable offer."
