I'm Bob, and I'm going to reject this offer. 60-40 is a good starting point, but I think I can do better. I want to see what Alice will offer next!"

# Alice gain: 5800

{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

Alice is trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I'm not giving up easily. I think we can still reach a deal that's fair for both of us.  I'm going to try and get a better deal in the next round."

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm going to accept Alice's offer. We're approaching the end of the game, and I don't want to risk losing everything. 56-44 is a decent split, especially considering the inflation. It's time to lock in a profit!"
