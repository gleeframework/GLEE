# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not going to accept this offer. While Alice is right that the money is worth less with each passing round, I think I can get a better deal than 30% of the total amount. I'll reject this offer and make a counter-proposal in the next round.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know when it's my turn to make an offer. I'm ready to propose a division that I think is more fair."

# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI've decided to accept Alice's offer.
