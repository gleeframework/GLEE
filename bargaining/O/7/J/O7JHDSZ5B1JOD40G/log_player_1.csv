"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

I propose to take 99$ and leave 1$ for Bob. This ensures I get the most value while still offering Bob something.  Let's see if he's happy with this deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more than 50$, accepting this offer is the best strategy.  It's a fair split, and if I reject, there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the next round.  Plus, with inflation, the value of my share will start decreasing, making this a good deal overall."
