Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

I'm offering you $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself."

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll need to adjust my strategy. In this round, I'll aim to maximize my gain while considering the reduced value of the money.

I'll reject this offer.
