"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a generous 40% of the initial amount. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can split the money!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is already taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering the offer from Bob, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject it. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the previous round, my share of $300,000 is equivalent to $240,000 in the first round's value. This is still a significant amount, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.
