"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money 4:1. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Splitting 50/50 is a fair start. Your turn to counter. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's 50/50 offer because I'd rather try to get a better deal, considering the money is worth less with each passing round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise. Your turn to counter. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth even less due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than a 3,000 to 7,000 split, especially considering the money is worth less with each passing round. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.

# Bob's message: I'm sticking to my guns. This is a fair split, and I'm willing to compromise. Your turn to counter. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth significantly less now. I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I still think I can get a better deal. A 4,000 to 6,000 split is not as favorable to me as I'd like, considering the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's try a 50/50 split again. It's a fair and even split, considering the value of the money is decreasing rapidly.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping that Bob will accept it this time."
