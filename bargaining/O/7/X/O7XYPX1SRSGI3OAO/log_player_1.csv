"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000 and keeping $9,000 for myself. It's a generous offer, considering the time pressure and the risk of inflation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 20% less, so I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

However, considering the simplicity and fairness of the offer, I'll accept it. After all, 50/50 is a reasonable split, and I don't want to risk going to the 10th round.
