"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

This offer gives me $6,000 and Bob $4,000, which is a 60-40 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's compromise and meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 20% less, so $6,000 is now equivalent to $4,800. And Bob's gain is worth 5% less, so $4,000 is now equivalent to $3,800.

Considering Bob's offer, I'd be gaining $5,000, which is equivalent to $4,000 in the original value. That's a good compromise, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With another round of inflation, my gain is now worth 20% less than in the previous round, so $4,800 is now equivalent to $3,840. Bob's gain is worth 5% less, so $3,800 is now equivalent to $3,610.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think I deserve a bit more for my efforts.""
}
```

This offer gives me $5,500, which is equivalent to $4,320 in the original value, and Bob gets $4,500, which is equivalent to $4,135 in the original value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think I deserve a bit more for my efforts too. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is getting worse!

In the first round, I had $6,000, which is now worth 48.8% less, so that's equivalent to $3,124.80. Bob's gain of $4,000 is now worth 14.26% less, so that's equivalent to $3,442.60.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'd be gaining $4,500, which is equivalent to $3,180.60 in the original value. That's a bit less than what I had initially, but it's still a decent compromise.
