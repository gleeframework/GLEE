I propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor. This seems like a fair starting point, given I'm making the first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm increasing my share slightly to 8000, but still offering Bob 2000. I'm hoping this will be more appealing than his last offer, considering inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, with each round, Bob's offer becomes more appealing as the inflation hits him harder.  It's better to secure 4500 now than risk getting less in the next round."
