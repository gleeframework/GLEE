"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

I propose taking 999,000 for myself and leaving Bob with 1,000. This is a large initial offer, but I want to start strong and see if Bob is willing to negotiate.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. While it is a significant increase from his first offer, it is still significantly lower than what I proposed in the first round. I am willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for such a low percentage."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm willing to compromise by offering Bob 100,000, which is 10 times more than his last offer, while still securing 900,000 for myself. This should hopefully encourage further negotiation and prevent us from getting to the later rounds where the value of the money decreases."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. Although the amount offered to me is higher than in the previous round, the inflation effect is significant, and his offer is still too low compared to what I initially proposed. I'm hoping to reach a more equitable split before the inflation significantly impacts both of us."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm offering Bob 200,000, which is more than double what he offered me in the last round. We're getting closer to a 50/50 split, and I think it's time for him to start meeting me halfway. The inflation is getting worse, and I don't want to risk losing too much more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, considering the inflation. While the amount he's offering me has increased, the decrease in value due to inflation makes it a worse deal than previous rounds. I need to secure a larger share to compensate for the increasing inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm proposing a 70/30 split, offering Bob 300,000. This is a significant increase from his last offer and puts us closer to a fair compromise. The inflation is escalating, and we need to reach an agreement soon."
