"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, 60-40. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable for a starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split in my favor is more fair, given the potential for inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a toll on my gains.

I'll have to think carefully about this new offer. Since Bob is pushing for a 60-40 split in his favor, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject.

After considering the offer, I'll...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 60-40 split in favor of Bob, especially since I'm already facing inflation. I'll try to negotiate further. Your turn, Bob!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise on a 55-45 split. Let's meet in the middle!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and being realistic about the decreasing value of money. Your turn, Bob!"
