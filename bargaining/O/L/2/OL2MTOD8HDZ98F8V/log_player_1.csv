"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I think we can both be happy with this.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40. This is a fair split, and I think it's a good starting point for the game. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject the offer!"
