"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}

I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor. Since I'm the first to propose, I'm going for a large share. However, I'm also leaving a small amount for Bob to incentivize him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though the money I gain is worth less due to inflation, a 50/50 split is still better than what I would get if we keep rejecting offers."
