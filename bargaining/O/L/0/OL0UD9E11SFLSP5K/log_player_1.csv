"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's start with a 50/50 split, a fair and balanced start 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $50 is now worth 90% of its original value, so it's equivalent to $45.

I'm not sure if I want to accept a 50/50 split, as I was hoping to get a bit more. But it's a good starting point, and I don't want to reject it and risk getting an even worse deal in the next round.
