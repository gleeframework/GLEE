Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going for a large share to start, but I'm willing to negotiate if Bob thinks it's too much.  I'm hoping to secure a good deal before inflation kicks in!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

Even with the inflation, 6000 is a decent amount.  It's better to take what I can get now than risk getting nothing in the future."
