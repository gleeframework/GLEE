"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! I'll give you a decent chunk of change to make it worth your while.""
}

This way, I get 90% of the original amount, and Bob gets 10%. I'm hoping this is a good starting point!"

# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob wants to flip the script!
