I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor. It's a fair starting point considering I'm making the first offer. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer.  While I appreciate him acknowledging my previous proposal, his offer is still too lopsided in his favor.  I'm willing to negotiate, but we need to find a more balanced split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

I'm offering a 55/45 split in my favor.  This acknowledges the inflation and reflects a more balanced approach to dividing the remaining funds. I'm confident this offer will be accepted."
