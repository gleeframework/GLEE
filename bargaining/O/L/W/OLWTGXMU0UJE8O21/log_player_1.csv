I'm going to be greedy and take most of the money in the first round. This way, I get the biggest chunk before inflation kicks in.  Let's see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is a fair deal for both of us. While my offer was rejected in the previous round, the money is now worth less for both of us. It's better to take what we can get now than risk losing everything."
