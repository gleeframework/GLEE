I propose a slightly unfair but reasonable split, giving me 51 dollars and Bob 49 dollars. This allows me to secure a majority of the money while still leaving Bob with a decent share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I propose a 50/50 split. With the inflation, I don't think it's worth risking another round. This is a fair and reasonable split that avoids further potential losses."
