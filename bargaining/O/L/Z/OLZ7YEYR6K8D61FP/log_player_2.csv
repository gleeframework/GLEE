Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but the declining value of the money significantly impacts me.  This offer is a compromise, aiming for a fairer resolution. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to a more even split, it's still heavily in her favor considering the rapid depreciation of her share.  We need to push her towards a more equitable arrangement."
