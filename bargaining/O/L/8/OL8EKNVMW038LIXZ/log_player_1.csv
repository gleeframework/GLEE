"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

This is a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 20% less, I'm actually gaining more in real terms if I accept Bob's offer.

I accept the offer.
