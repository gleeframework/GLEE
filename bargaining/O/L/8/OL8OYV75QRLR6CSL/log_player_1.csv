"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take 60, you take 40. No need to negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which is a relatively even split, and I'm suggesting that we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bigger share, but I still want to keep some for myself. 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my share is worth 20% less, so I'll have to adjust my expectations.

I'll analyze Bob's offer:

* I would gain $70, which is worth 80% of the original $60 I was offered in Round 1.
* Bob would gain $30, which is the same as his original offer.

Considering the inflation, I think this is a decent offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll decide to reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 40% of its original value due to two rounds of inflation, I'll aim for a higher share to compensate for the decreased value.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a slightly larger share, but I'm not willing to give up too much. This is my best offer so far.""
}
```

I'm offering an 80-20 split, which is a significant increase from the original offer, but I'm still leaving some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not willing to give up too much more. This is my best offer so far. 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","With the third round of inflation, my share is worth only 51.2% of the original $60 I was offered in Round 1, which is $30.60.

I'll analyze Bob's offer:

* I would gain $75, which is worth 125% of the original $60 I was offered in Round 1.
* Bob would gain $25, which is the same as his original offer.

Considering the significant inflation and the fact that Bob's offer is still relatively close to the original offer, I think this is a decent offer. I'll decide to accept this offer.
