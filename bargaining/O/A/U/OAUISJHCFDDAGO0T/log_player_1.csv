Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a relatively fair offer to see how Bob responds. If he rejects this, I'll be more aggressive in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 937500 
# Bob gain: 62500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred to keep more of the money, the inflation means that each round I wait, the value of the money I receive decreases. It's not a great offer, but it's better than waiting and getting even less in the next round."
