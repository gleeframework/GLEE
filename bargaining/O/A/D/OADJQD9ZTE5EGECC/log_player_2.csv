"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 90% and you can have 10%. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While 100,000 is a decent sum, it's worth considering the potential for a better deal later.  I'll see what Alice offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I'm willing to split the money 60/40 in my favor, considering the potential for inflation. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take 70% of the remaining money, but I'm willing to give you 30%. I think this is a fair split considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred a more even split, considering the inflation and the fact that I have no way of knowing how Alice is being affected, accepting this offer is the best course of action. I can still gain a decent sum, and further negotiation might not be worth the risk of getting nothing."
