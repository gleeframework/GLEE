Let's see if Bob is willing to accept a deal that's heavily in my favor right off the bat!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, it's better to take this deal than risk getting nothing at all in later rounds. The inflation is hitting Bob harder, so he's likely to become more and more aggressive in his demands."
