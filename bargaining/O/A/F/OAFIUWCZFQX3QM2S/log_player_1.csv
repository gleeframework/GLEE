"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, I'd like to get a higher share to compensate for the loss in value.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now and wait for the next round. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll need to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm willing to compromise""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still trying to get a decent amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'm getting impatient 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on me! With the money worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I need to be very careful with my decisions.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about getting only 20, but I'm starting to get a bit desperate. I'll have to weigh the risk of waiting for a better offer against the possibility of getting nothing if I reject this one.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
