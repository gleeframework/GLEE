Round 2

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think it's fairer if I get a bit more since you got the bigger share last time.  Let's split it 60/40 this time.""}

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 55/45 this time.  That's a fair compromise given the inflation, and we can both walk away with a decent amount. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
