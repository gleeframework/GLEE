"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $250,000, and I'll take the rest.""
}
```

This way, we both get a significant amount, and we can negotiate further in the next rounds."

# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","That's a very uneven split. I'm not willing to accept such a small share. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal.

```
{

}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and the fact that the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll make a new offer. I'll try to get a better share this time.

```
{

  ""bob_gain"": 600000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you the majority, but I need a decent share for myself. Let's meet in the middle.""

Round 4

# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more, but I'll give you a decent share to keep you motivated to negotiate. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and the decreasing value of the money, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a better share. I'll aim for a 50/50 split, but I'll give Bob a slight edge since I'm starting to run out of time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm running out of time, so I'll give you a slight edge. Let's split it 58/42.""
