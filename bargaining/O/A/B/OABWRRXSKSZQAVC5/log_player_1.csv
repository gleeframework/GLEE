"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. The message is a friendly nudge to get Bob to accept the offer quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 90% and you can have 10%.  Let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

I'm not too thrilled about the 10% cut, but I'd rather not risk going to the next round. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the $100,000 and call it a day."
