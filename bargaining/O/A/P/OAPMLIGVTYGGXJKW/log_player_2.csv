"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, I'll take a bit more to end this quickly. Inflation is no joke! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to reject. While it's a decent deal now, inflation will hit Alice much harder than me in the next round. I can likely get a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I'm offering you a slightly better deal than before, but inflation will hit you harder than me in the next round. Let's end this quickly.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling the inflation pinch already. This is my final offer - let's wrap it up. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While inflation is hitting me harder than before, it's still a better deal than if I reject and go to the next round. Plus, Alice is adamant this is her final offer."
