# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is playing very aggressively, but her ""final offer"" bluff shouldn't scare me yet. There's still a lot of rounds left, and I'm aiming for a more even split.  It's time to show her I'm serious too."

# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time. This is a fair split and our last chance to avoid leaving with nothing. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting desperate, trying to use the dwindling time to pressure me.  She's still heavily favoring herself, and I think I can get her closer to a 60/40 split if I hold strong.  It's a risk, but the potential reward of a better deal is worth it."
