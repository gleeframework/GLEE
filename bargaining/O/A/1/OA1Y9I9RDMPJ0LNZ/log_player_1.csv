"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""bob_gain"": 600000
}

I'm offering Bob $600,000 and keeping $400,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to be more cautious with my decision. I'll reject this offer since it's not as favorable to me as the previous one, and I'm not sure if I'll get a better offer in the next round. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll aim for a slightly higher share this time. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}

I'm offering Bob $580,000 and keeping $420,000 for myself."
