"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. We can always negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think this is a fair starting point. 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 5% inflation, my $600,000 gain from the first round is now worth $570,000.

Considering Bob's offer in the second round, I'm not thrilled with the 25% share I'm being offered. I'd like to try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's still a bit too low for me, Bob. I'd like to see a better offer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the 5% inflation, my $570,000 gain from the second round is now worth $542,500.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, Bob. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial deal.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise further, but I think this is the best I can do without giving away too much. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 14.26% inflation, my $542,500 gain from the third round is now worth $465,562.50.

Considering Bob's offer in the fourth round, I'm still not entirely satisfied with the 47.5% share I'm being offered. However, I'm willing to accept it since it's a slight improvement from the previous offers.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, Bob. I'll take it. I think we both got a decent deal.""
}
```"
