Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:

**Reasoning:**

Even though Alice is offering a slightly better deal, accepting now would give Bob only $450,000 (due to inflation). If Bob rejects this offer and Alice rejects Bob's next offer, the game will go to the final round. At that point, Bob has no choice but to accept whatever Alice offers. It's a risky move, but Bob can still try to secure a larger share in the next round before being forced to accept a potentially worse deal in the final round."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical solution. Let's end this now before the inflation eats away at the value any further.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a high-stakes gamble, but it's Bob's last chance to negotiate. Here's why:

* **Final Round:**  This is the penultimate round. If Alice rejects this offer, Bob will be forced to accept whatever she offers in the final round, which could be far worse than a 50/50 split.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  The longer the game goes on, the more Bob loses to inflation. Accepting a smaller loss now might be preferable to a potentially much larger loss in the final round.
* **Fairness Appeal:**  A 50/50 split is inherently fair and might appeal to Alice's sense of reason, especially since she's aware of the inflation working against Bob. 

This is a bold move, but it might be Bob's best shot at securing a reasonable share of the money."
