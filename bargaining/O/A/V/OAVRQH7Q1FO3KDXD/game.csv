55.0,45.0,"I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need a fairer split than 60/40.  How about we go with 55/45?  We both lose money with each round, so let's compromise.",Alice,3,

42.0,58.0,"I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer, Alice. How about 58/42?  The clock is ticking and we both lose with every round.",Bob,4,

52.0,48.0,"I'm still not comfortable with that 58/42 split. Let's meet in the middle again, at 52/48. It's a better deal for both of us, and we can avoid further losses from inflation.",Alice,5,
