"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This means I'm offering to take 600,000 dollars and leaving 400,000 dollars for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll adjust my calculation accordingly.

My gain of 450,000 is worth 90% of the original amount, which is 450,000 * 0.9 = 405,000.
Bob's gain of 550,000 is worth 80% of the original amount, which is 550,000 * 0.8 = 440,000.

Considering the adjusted values, I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This time, I'm offering a slightly different split, with me taking 550,000 and leaving 450,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the adjusted values for Round 4.

My gain of 500,000 is worth 72.9% of the original amount (100% - 27.1% = 72.9%), which is 500,000 * 0.729 = 364,500.
Bob's gain of 500,000 is worth 51.2% of the original amount (100% - 48.8% = 51.2%), which is 500,000 * 0.512 = 256,000.

Considering the adjusted values, I'll accept this offer.
