"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, let's get this done quickly. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. The current offer is too skewed in Alice's favor, and I believe I can negotiate a better deal. Let's see what happens in the next round! \n\n###\n\nPlease let Alice know my decision and let's move on to Round 2! \n\n###\n\n(Remember, with each passing round, the money is worth 20% less for me, so I'll need to take that into account in my future proposals.) \n\n###\n\nThanks for relaying the message!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'd like to make a counteroffer that's more balanced, considering the decreasing value of money for both of us. Here's my proposal:\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and account for inflation!""}\n\n###\n\nPlease relay this offer to Alice and let's see how she responds! \n\n###\n\n(Remember, the money is now worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Alice compared to the initial amount.) \n\n###\n\nLooking forward to Alice's decision! \n\n###\n\nThanks for facilitating the game!"
