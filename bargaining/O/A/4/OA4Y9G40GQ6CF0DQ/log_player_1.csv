{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we each get $500,000. This is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 400,000 offer, but I'm willing to negotiate. Since Bob is giving me a smaller share, I'll make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""I'm not sure about 400,000. How about 420,000 for me?""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

I'm increasing my share to 420,000 and giving Bob a slightly larger share of 580,000. Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this offer."

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my share! I'm not thrilled about the 300,000 offer, but I'm getting desperate. I'll think carefully before making a decision.

After some thought, I've decided to:

{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Okay, I'll take the 300,000. I'm not getting any younger, and I don't want to risk going to the next round.""}

I'm accepting Bob's offer, hoping that 300,000 is enough to make it worth my while."
