Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I deserve a bit more, considering the inflation hits you harder. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob is trying to take advantage of the situation. I'm willing to negotiate, but not to be taken advantage of. I need to propose something that benefits me more in the next round, but is still tempting enough for Bob to accept."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

""decision"": ""reject""

This is getting dangerous. Bob is clearly trying to pressure me into accepting a bad deal. I need to hold my ground, but I also need to make sure my next offer takes into account the increasing impact of inflation."
