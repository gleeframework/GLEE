"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering to give Bob 50% of the money, and I'll take the other 50%. This is a fair and straightforward offer to begin with. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 4000, but I think I deserve a bit more since I'm the one making the offer 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 20% less for me, so I'll gain 4000 * 0.8 = 3200, and Bob will gain 6000 * 0.9 = 5400.

I'll reject this offer because I think I deserve more, considering the inflation affects me more severely. My response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round for me, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3500,
  ""bob_gain"": 6500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I still think 65/35 is a fair split""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping the majority of the money for myself. It's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more since I'm the one making the offer. 70/30 is a more reasonable split 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 48.8% less for me, so I'll gain 3000 * 0.516 = 1548. So, the offer is actually a good one for me.

I'll accept this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
