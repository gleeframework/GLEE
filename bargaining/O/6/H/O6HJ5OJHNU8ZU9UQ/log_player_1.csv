I'm starting with a generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept it. After all, it's the first round, and I want to get this game over with before inflation kicks in!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though the money is worth less, it's still better to accept this offer than to risk another round of inflation and potentially get an even worse deal."
