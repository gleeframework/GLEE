Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going for a pretty aggressive offer in the first round.  Since the money depreciates with each round, I want to secure as much as possible early on. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd like to get more than 50%, it's a fair offer considering the inflation. It's better to secure half the money than risk losing it all in further rounds."
