"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'll reject this offer and see what Alice proposes next. 1000 is a very small share, and I can likely do better with further negotiations."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}
``` 

I'm offering Alice 4000, keeping 6000 for myself. I believe this is a fair split, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement in the next few rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share,  accepting this offer is the best option given the inflation. I'm gaining 3000 which is better than nothing, and the inflation will only continue to erode the value of the money if we continue negotiating."
