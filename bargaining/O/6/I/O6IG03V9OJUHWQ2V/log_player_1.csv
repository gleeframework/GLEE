"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

This is a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting Bob's gain, I'll consider the value of the money he's offering me is worth 5% more than what he's actually getting. Since he's offering me $4000, I'll consider it as $4200 in terms of purchasing power.

Considering this, I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
