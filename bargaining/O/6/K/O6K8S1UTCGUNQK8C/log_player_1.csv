"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a chance to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000, which is a relatively small amount, hoping he'll think it's a fair starting point and will want to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $5,000 in Round 2 is worth less than my gain of $9,000 in Round 1.

I'll think about it... Meeting in the middle seems like a reasonable proposal, but I'd like to try to get a bit more. However, it's a good starting point, and I don't want to risk going to Round 3 with even less value.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
