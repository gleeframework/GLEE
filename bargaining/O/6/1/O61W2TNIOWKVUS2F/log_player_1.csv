I'm offering Bob a smaller share, but this is the first round and I'm still trying to gauge his preferences. Let's see what he does."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 840000 
# Bob gain: 160000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation rate for Bob is much higher than mine. Accepting this offer is a good way to secure a decent amount of money, especially considering the risk of getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
