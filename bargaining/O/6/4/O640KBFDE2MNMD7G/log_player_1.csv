"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start, see how it goes""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to begin with, and I'm curious to see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I deserve a little more, but let's see what you think. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it for a moment...

I'm not thrilled about giving up $1000 more than I did in the first round, but I'm willing to compromise. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer and take $4000."
