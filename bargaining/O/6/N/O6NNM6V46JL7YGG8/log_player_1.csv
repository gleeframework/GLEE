"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10} 
``` 
 
I'll start by offering Bob a small share, hoping he'll accept it in the first round. I'll adjust my offer in the next rounds if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is quite unreasonable, especially after he rejected my fair offer in the first round. I'll see if I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20} 
``` 

I'm going to offer Bob a slightly larger share this time, but still keeping the majority for myself. I'm hoping he'll recognize the value of getting something now, rather than risking getting nothing later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still being too greedy. I'm losing a lot of value due to inflation, but I'm not going to cave in to his demands this early in the game. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm starting to feel the pressure of inflation, but I still believe I can secure a decent share of the money.  This offer is more generous than my last one, but I'm not willing to give Bob more than 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offers are becoming increasingly unreasonable.  I'm losing a significant amount of value due to inflation, but I'm not going to be forced into accepting a terrible deal.  I'll try to negotiate a better outcome in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm feeling the pressure of inflation, but I'm still trying to get a fair share.  I'm offering Bob a larger portion than before, but I'm not willing to give up more than 40%.  Hopefully, he'll recognize that it's better to accept something now than risk getting nothing at all."
