"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\n###\nI'll offer Bob $4000 and keep $6000 for myself. Since the money doesn't lose value for me, I can make a more conservative offer. The message is a simple ""Let's divide fairly"" to try to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split, considering the money is worth less to me in the next round. Let's end this now. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer because I can try to get a better deal in the next round. Since the money doesn't lose value for me, I can afford to wait and make another proposal. Also, Bob's argument about the money being worth less to him in the next round is true, but it also means that he'll be more eager to settle in the next round, which gives me an advantage."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a bit more, considering the inflation""}\n\n###\nIn this round, I'll increase my share to $6500 and offer Bob $3500. Since the money is worth 20% less to Bob in each round, he may be more willing to accept a smaller share to avoid further losses. My message acknowledges the inflation and tries to justify my increased share."
