"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. Let's start with a 90/10 split.  Think of it as an investment in a good relationship for future rounds! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round. With a 10% decrease in value each round, I'm willing to take the risk to potentially get a better offer. Alice's ""generous"" offer still leaves me with a relatively small share, and I believe I can negotiate for more. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering the inflation I'm facing!""}\n\nI've taken into account the 10% decrease in value for me, and I'm hoping Alice will consider the impact of future rounds on my share. A 40/60 split seems more reasonable, and I'm hoping Alice will see it as a fair compromise. Fingers crossed!"
