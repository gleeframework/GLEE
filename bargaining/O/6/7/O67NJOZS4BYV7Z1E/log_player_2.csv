"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Alice, the total value of the money is now 95% of 100$ for me and 90% of 100$ for Alice.

My offer is:
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 9.75% less for me and 19% less for Alice compared to the first round, I'll calculate the effective values.

For me, the offer is 50 * 0.90 * 0.9875 = 48.4375 (approximately)
For Alice, the offer is 50 * 0.80 * 0.9875 = 39.375 (approximately)

My offer is still better for me, so I'll reject this one too.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","The money is worth 9.75% less for me and 19% less for Alice compared to the first round, so the total value of the money is now 90% of 90% of 100$ for me and 80% of 80% of 100$ for Alice.

My offer is:
{""bob_gain"": 72, ""alice_gain"": 28}"
