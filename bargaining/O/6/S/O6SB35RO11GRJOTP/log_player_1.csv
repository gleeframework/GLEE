"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, which I think is a fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60/40 is a fair split, given the inflation rates we're facing. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is identical to mine in the first round, but with the adjusted values due to inflation. I'll have to think carefully about this...

I'll reject Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that this is the best deal, considering the inflation rates. I'd like to make a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer, taking into account the 20% reduction in value for me and the 5% reduction in value for Bob:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""Compromise: I'll take less to ensure we reach a deal""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42/58 split, which I think is a reasonable compromise given the changing value of the money."
