"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that we split the $1,000,000 equally, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but still fair 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the $450,000 I would gain in this round is worth $360,000 in the previous round's value.

I'm not thrilled about giving up more than I did in the first round, but I'm willing to negotiate. I'll accept this offer.
