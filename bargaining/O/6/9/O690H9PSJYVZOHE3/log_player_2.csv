Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: Considering the inflation and the previous offers, I propose a 60/40 split in favor of Alice. This aims to find a balance where both of us feel fairly compensated, given the decreasing value of money over time.
