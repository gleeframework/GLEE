Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start""
}
```

This is a fair and equal split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have a smaller share, but I'm still willing to give you a decent amount 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less, I'm getting a slightly smaller share, but still a decent amount.

I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,

```

I'm trying to negotiate a bit more, hoping to get a better deal."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'm not giving up much 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of me!

Considering the money is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, $3000 is actually a pretty low offer. I'm not sure I want to accept it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll keep trying to negotiate for a better deal!"

# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000

Considering the money is worth 22.62% less than in the first round, $2000 is a very low offer. I'm not sure I want to accept it.

```

  ""message"": ""This is my final offer, take it or we'll go to arbitration""
}
```
