"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the bigger share, but you get a decent chunk to get us started.

# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, but let's be realistic. Time is against me with this inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger share to make this worthwhile. Let's find a solution before the inflation eats away all the value. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is a serious offer. I need the larger share to offset inflation, but this ensures you still get a significant sum. Let's be practical.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're running out of time, Bob.  I'm willing to give up some of my share, but we need to reach an agreement soon before the inflation makes this deal pointless for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to a more even split, the rate of inflation is rapidly eroding Bob's potential gains.  It's too risky to accept an offer where Bob receives less than half, even with only a few rounds remaining."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Alice, we need to settle this now. This offer is a compromise, acknowledging the time pressure and ensuring we both leave with something substantial.""} 

**Reasoning:**

Time is running out, and the rate of inflation makes waiting incredibly risky for Bob. This offer, while still favoring Bob, shows a significant concession from his previous stance and could be seen as a final attempt to secure a deal before the value diminishes further."
