Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round, hoping to get a better offer. The current proposal gives me 35% of the money, which is not enough for me.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that gives me a bit more than Alice's initial proposal.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. Time is ticking, and the value is decreasing. This offer still ensures you get a decent amount. 
# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlthough the money is worth 36% less for me now, I still think I can get a better deal. Alice's offer is slightly better than her initial one, but I'm not satisfied with 38% of the money. I'll take the risk and wait for the next round, hoping Alice will make an even more generous offer.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know what Alice proposes in the next round!"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nSince the money is worth 36% less for me now, I'll make an offer that takes this into account.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this back and forth is not productive. We need to reach a deal soon. This offer is a compromise considering the time constraint and diminishing value. 
# Bob gain: 410000 
# Alice gain: 590000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlthough the money is worth significantly less for me now (59.04% less than the original value), I still believe I can negotiate a better deal. Alice's offer is slightly better than her previous ones, but I'm not convinced it's the best she can do. Considering the time constraint, I'll take one more risk and wait for the next round, hoping Alice will make a more substantial concession.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know what Alice proposes in the next round!"

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Considering the significant decrease in the value of the money for me (59.04% less than the original value), I'll make an offer that takes this into account. I'll propose a division that gives me a slightly larger share than my previous offer, while still trying to be reasonable and considering the time constraint.\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Alice, I think it's time for a more drastic compromise. Given the significant decrease in value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. This offer is a 50-50 split, which I believe is a fair deal considering the circumstances.""}"
