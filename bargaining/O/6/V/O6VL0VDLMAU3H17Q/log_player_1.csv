"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll have to accept a slightly smaller share. I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
