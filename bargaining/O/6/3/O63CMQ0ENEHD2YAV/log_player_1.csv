"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,
  ""message"": ""I propose we divide the $100 with a 3:1 ratio, giving you $25 and keeping $75 for myself. This is a fair offer considering the potential decrease in value due to inflation.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split the money 60/40.  This is a more fair distribution, and we both get a decent amount. Let's end the game and avoid any more inflation. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
