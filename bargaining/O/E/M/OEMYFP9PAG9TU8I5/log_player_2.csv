Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want a fair deal, but I need to account for inflation. Let's settle this with a slightly better split for me. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While this is a better offer than my previous one, I'm going to push for an even better deal. The inflation is in my favor now, and I'm confident I can get a more even split."
