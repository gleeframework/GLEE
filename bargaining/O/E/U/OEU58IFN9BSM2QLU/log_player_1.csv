Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was a bit too skewed in your favor.  Let's be reasonable. This offer gives me a slight advantage, acknowledging the time-value of money.  It's a good deal for both of us if we settle now. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
