"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I take a bit more considering the inflation rate impacts me less. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is reasonable, it's better to see if I can get a better deal, especially considering the inflation will affect me more. I'll try to negotiate a more even split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly this time. We both know the money is losing value, so let's be fair and work together.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out. I'll come down a little, but this is a fair deal considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still better for her, but with the inflation hitting me harder, I need to take what I can get before it's too late. Accepting this offer gives me something at least."
