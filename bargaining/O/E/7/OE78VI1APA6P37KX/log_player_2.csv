Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","```json

While 2500 is a decent starting point, I'm not going to accept anything less than 5000 right away.  I want to see if I can do better, especially since the money is going to be worth less in each round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}
``` 
Let's start with a 50/50 split.  This seems fair, and we both get a decent amount.  I'm hopeful Alice will accept this."
