I'm going for a big chunk, but leaving Bob with something to potentially make him accept in the first round.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being greedy! I'm not going to let him get away with that. Even with the inflation, I'll hold out for a better deal.  Let's see what he offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm lowering my share slightly, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount.  It's a risk, but I think I can get a better deal in the long run."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation.  I'm still holding out for a better deal.  I'll see what he offers next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

We're getting close to the end, and the inflation is really starting to bite.  I'm offering a 50/50 split. This is the fairest deal, and hopefully, Bob will finally see reason."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm starting to feel the pressure of the inflation.  Even though Bob is still getting more, I'm taking this offer. There's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in the next round, and the risk of getting nothing is too high."
