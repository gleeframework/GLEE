"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 40% share, which I think is a generous starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'm not going easy on you! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to negotiate from a position of strength!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. With inflation, the $2000 I'd gain is worth only 95% of what it was in the first round, so it's actually worth $1900 in ""real"" terms.

I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer or reject it and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a stronger offer this time. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not getting taken advantage of!""
}
```

I'm increasing my offer to 55% of the total, which I think is a reasonable compromise. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a smaller share, but I'm not budging further! 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to squeeze me out!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. With inflation, the $1000 I'd gain is worth only 85.74% of what it was in the first round, so it's actually worth $855 in ""real"" terms.

I'm not sure if I'm willing to accept such a small share, but I don't want to risk losing everything either. I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer or reject it and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not going to let you take everything! Take a smaller share and let's move on.""
}
```

I'm taking a firmer stance and offering Bob a 30% share, which I think is a more reasonable compromise. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: It's time to be fair, let's split it 50-50 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to make a conciliatory offer!

I'm surprised he's suggesting a 50-50 split, but I'm not sure if I can trust him after all the previous rejections. With inflation, the $5000 I'd gain is worth only 77.38% of what it was in the first round, so it's actually worth $3879 in ""real"" terms.

I'm not sure if I'm willing to take the risk of getting only $3879, but I don't want to pass up a chance at a 50-50 split. I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer or reject it and try to negotiate further.
