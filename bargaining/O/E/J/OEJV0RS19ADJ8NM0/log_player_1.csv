"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to begin with, hoping to set a fair tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but still fair 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 10% less, the actual values are:

Alice gain: $4,000 (pre-inflation) = $3,600 (post-inflation)
Bob gain: $6,000 (pre-inflation) = $5,400 (post-inflation)

I'm not too keen on Bob taking a larger share. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Since the money is worth 10% less again, the actual value is $9,000 (pre-inflation) = $8,100 (post-inflation).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll compromise again, but not that much 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 27.1% less than the original $10,000, the actual value is $7,271 (pre-inflation) = $5,266.90 (post-inflation).

Considering the previous offers, I think this one is a bit more reasonable. I'll accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
