"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we each get $5000. This seems like a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, let's try for a better deal! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 4000/6000 split, but I'm willing to negotiate. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll try to get a better deal. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll try to adjust my proposal accordingly. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, a 45/55 split is fair given the inflation""}

I'm proposing a 45/55 split, which is a slight adjustment from my initial 50/50 offer. I'm hoping Bob will find this more acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'm taking a bigger share this time! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob's offer is getting more aggressive! I'm not thrilled about the 3000/7000 split, but I'm running out of time and options. I'll have to think carefully about this one. Since the money is worth even less due to inflation, I'll have to make a tough decision. I'll accept this offer, hoping that Bob will be more reasonable in the next round.
