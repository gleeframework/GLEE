"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, it's a fair and simple way to begin.""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a straightforward and fair way to start the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a slight advantage for me is fair, as I get to make the first proposal.  Let's see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not comfortable with the 55/45 split in favor of Bob. I was hoping for a more balanced split, especially since I didn't get to make the first proposal. I'll try to make a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 475000, ""bob_gain"": 525000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share, but I still think 50/50 is a fair starting point. Let's meet in the middle at 47.5/52.5.""}

I'm trying to find a middle ground that's closer to 50/50, while still giving Bob a slightly larger share than my initial offer."
