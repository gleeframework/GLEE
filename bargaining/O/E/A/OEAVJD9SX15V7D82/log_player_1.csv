"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering to take $600,000 and leave $400,000 for Bob. This is a fairly balanced offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it to avoid going to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll need to adjust my strategy. Bob's offer is quite aggressive, but I'll consider it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm offering to take $550,000 and leave $450,000 for Bob. This is a slightly more favorable split for me, but still a reasonable offer to try to get the game to a conclusion."
