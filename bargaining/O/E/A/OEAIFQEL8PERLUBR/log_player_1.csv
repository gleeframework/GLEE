"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Accept and we can move on to the next round, or I'll make a better offer next time.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but it's a fair starting point. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take it or leave it, I'm not budging! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Considering the inflation, the money is now worth 90% of its original value. With this in mind, I'll make my decision.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept Bob's offer. I'll wait for a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 81% of its original value due to inflation, I'll adjust my proposal accordingly.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7200,
  ""bob_gain"": 2800,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob! It's a fair split.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I'm not giving up yet! 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on the money's value!

Considering the offer, I'll make my decision.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take Bob's offer this time. 7000 is a decent amount, and I don't want to risk going to Round 5 with the money being worth even less."
