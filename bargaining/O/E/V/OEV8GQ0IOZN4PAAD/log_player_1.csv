"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5}
```

I'm going for a pretty aggressive opening move, aiming to secure the lion's share of the money.  Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a blatant power play by Bob, and I'm not going to give in that easily. The inflation is starting to bite, but I believe I can still secure a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm adjusting my offer slightly, but still aiming for a larger share. The inflation is impacting both of us, but I think I can still get a good deal.  I'm hoping Bob sees the value in settling sooner rather than later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

The inflation is hitting hard, but I'm not ready to accept a deal that gives me such a small share. Bob's offer is getting more reasonable, but I believe I can still get a better outcome. I'm going to keep pushing for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm slightly decreasing my offer, but still aiming for a majority share. I'm factoring in the increasing inflation, but I believe I can still secure a fair deal for myself.  Let's see if Bob is ready to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

The inflation is definitely taking its toll, but I'm still holding out for a better deal. Bob's offer is improving, but I'm confident I can still get a bigger piece of the pie."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

The inflation is getting pretty severe, and I'm starting to feel the pressure. I'm adjusting my offer downwards again, but I'm still aiming for a decent share.  I'm hoping Bob is starting to see the writing on the wall and is willing to compromise before the money becomes worthless."
