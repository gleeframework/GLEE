Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate the offer, Bob. But I still think I deserve more. I'll take 70% and you get 30%. This is my final offer, let's not waste any more time. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting greedier, and the inflation is starting to significantly impact her potential gains. I need to hold out for a better deal, but I also need to be mindful that time is running out."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. Time is literally money for both of us, and it's disappearing fast. I'm proposing a 55/45 split. This is a fair deal considering the circumstances.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Pressure:** Alice needs to understand the urgency of the situation. Highlighting the time pressure and the ""money disappearing"" aspect reinforces the need for a quick agreement. 
* **Fairness:** While I'm aiming for a slight advantage, the 55/45 split is presented as a reasonable compromise, especially considering the inflation working against Alice.
* **Positioning for future rounds:** If Alice rejects this, I'm in a stronger position to push for a more favorable deal in subsequent rounds as the pressure continues to mount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're both losing money with every passing round. I'm willing to compromise, but I can't go lower than 60%. Let's be reasonable and agree on this split before we both get nothing. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is feeling the pressure, but she's still overestimating her position.  While she's willing to go lower, she's losing value fast. I need to remain firm and highlight the shrinking pie.  The longer she waits, the less appealing a 60/40 split in her favor becomes."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm offering 52/48. You're focused on the percentage, but the actual value you're getting is shrinking fast.  Let's make a deal now before we both lose even more.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Highlighting the loss:**  Alice needs to understand that fixating on a 60/40 split is hurting her. Emphasizing the reduced actual value due to inflation is key.
* **Slight concession:** The offer is a small step back from 55/45, showing flexibility but not desperation.  
* **Urgency:**  The message continues to reinforce the time pressure, hoping to push Alice towards a more realistic agreement."
