"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm going to start with a fairly generous offer to Bob.  This is to see if he's willing to accept a quick deal, or if he thinks he can do better by waiting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse for me than my initial offer, and he's offering me only 20% of the money.  I'm willing to wait and see if he'll come back with a more reasonable proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but still giving Bob a decent share. I'm hoping this demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I value my own share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is slightly better than his last one, it's still not good enough for me. The inflation is hurting both of us, but I'm willing to wait and see if he'll compromise further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

With inflation increasing, I'm going to propose a 50/50 split. This is a fair offer, and hopefully Bob will realize that waiting further will only hurt both of us."
