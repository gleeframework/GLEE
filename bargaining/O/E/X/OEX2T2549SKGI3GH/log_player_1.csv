I'm going for a big initial gain, hoping Bob will accept to avoid the risk of losing more in the next round.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a bigger share, it's better to take the 5000 now. Inflation will continue to eat away at my potential gains, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the future. It's a fair split considering the circumstances."
