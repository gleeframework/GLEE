"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 3:1 ratio in my favor, as you offered in the previous round.  This is a fair compromise given the changing value of money. 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","{
