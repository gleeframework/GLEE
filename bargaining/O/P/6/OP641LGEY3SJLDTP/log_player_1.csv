Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $400,000. You can try to do better in the next round.""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, but I'm leaving room for Bob to negotiate or improve his offer in the next round."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can do better than that! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gain, I need to be more cautious. Since Bob's offer is now more favorable to him, I'll try to negotiate further.

```

}
```

I'll reject this offer and hope that Bob will make a more balanced proposal in the next round."

  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give away the farm. You can try to do better than this.""

# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on my potential gain. With the money worth less and less each round, I need to be careful. However, Bob's offer is still not as favorable as I'd like.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and try to make a more aggressive move in the next round. I'll need to be strategic to get a better deal before the money becomes even less valuable."

Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation affecting my gain even more, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a better deal. I'll aim for a higher gain, but still leave room for Bob to negotiate.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not going to give away more than 52% of the money. You can try to do better, but I'm not budging much more.""
}
```

This offer is a 48-52 split, which is more favorable to me than the previous offers. Let's see if Bob will take it or try to negotiate further."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to think you're not serious about a fair split. 
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll on my potential gain. However, Bob's offer is now more favorable to him than my previous offer, and it's also closer to a 50-50 split.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer. It's not ideal, but it's a relatively fair split, and I don't want to risk waiting for a better offer that might not come. With the inflation, I'm not sure how much more value I can get from the money."
