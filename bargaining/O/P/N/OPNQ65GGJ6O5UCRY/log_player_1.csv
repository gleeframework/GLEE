"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 60/40 split in my favor, as I am the first to offer.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation will continue to decrease the value of the money with each round.  Accepting this offer guarantees me a larger share than I would get if I were to reject and continue playing."
