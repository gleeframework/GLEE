"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer is a good starting point for both of us.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share Alice, but that's a bit too low for me.  How about we try something a bit more even?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out and the money is losing value. I'm meeting you halfway from my previous offer. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is still heavily favoring herself in this deal, and while the penalty for inflation is growing, I can likely get a better deal with a well-timed counter offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 425000, ""alice_gain"": 575000, ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle. This offer is a compromise that acknowledges the decreasing value of the money while still being fair to both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close to the point where the decreasing value makes this pointless for both of us. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 375000 
# Alice gain: 625000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a tough one, but time is really working against me now.  While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting a 375,000 payout now is better than risking getting nothing at all if the negotiations fail."
