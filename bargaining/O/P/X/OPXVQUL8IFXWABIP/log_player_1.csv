# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","This offer is tempting since Bob is taking a larger share of the shrinking pot. However, it's still early in the game, and accepting this would mean settling for significantly less than half. Let's see if I can negotiate a better deal.

Do you accept this offer?","Bob is steadily increasing his share while taking advantage of the inflation working against me. While I need to reach a deal soon, accepting now would mean losing a significant amount of money. I have to push back.

# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a tough situation. Bob is clearly being inflexible, and accepting his offer would mean a significant loss. However, with only two rounds left and the value decreasing rapidly, the risk of getting nothing is substantial.
