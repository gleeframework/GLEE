"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Will you accept?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair to split the money more evenly.  What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth less for me now!

I don't think it's fair that Bob gets 90% of the money. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, but I'm not getting too generous""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle. I think this is the fairest way to divide the money. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is getting worth less and less for me!

Splitting it down the middle sounds reasonable, and I'm not getting any younger. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the $500,000 and call it a day!"
