"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and let's split the money fairly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is 40% of the original amount, and I'll take the remaining $6,000, which is 60% of the original amount. Let's see if Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take a smaller share, let's play it safe! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'd rather take a smaller share now and be sure of getting something, rather than risking it all and potentially getting nothing.

I accept Bob's offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
