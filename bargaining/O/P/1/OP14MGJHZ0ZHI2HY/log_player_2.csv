"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money 60/40. This gives us a fair advantage to start, considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While 40 dollars is a good starting point, it's worth seeing if I can get a better deal. I'll try to negotiate a higher share in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is a better starting point for both of us. It's still a good deal for both sides, and it sets us up for a more balanced negotiation as the rounds progress.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I see your point about a more balanced split. How about we meet in the middle at 55/45?  It acknowledges the time pressure but is fairer than your last offer. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
While I prefer the 55/45 split I proposed,  Alice's offer is still a good deal for me, and accepting it means we can avoid the risk of getting nothing at all as the rounds progress and the inflation impacts both of us further."
