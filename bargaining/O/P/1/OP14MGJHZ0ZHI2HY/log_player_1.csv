"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is a better starting point for both of us. It's still a good deal for both sides, and it sets us up for a more balanced negotiation as the rounds progress. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
