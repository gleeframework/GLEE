"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can reassess as we go along.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting 60 dollars and Bob getting 40 dollars. I'm hoping this is a fair starting point, and we can adjust as needed in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, reflecting our different valuations of the money with each passing round. Let's see if this works for you. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not convinced that Bob's proposal is a significant improvement from my original offer. However, I'm willing to consider it. Since the money is worth less now, I'm not as opposed to a more unequal split as I was initially.
