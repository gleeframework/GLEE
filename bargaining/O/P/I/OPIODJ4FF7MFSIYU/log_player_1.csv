"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more since I'm not affected by inflation 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5100,
""bob_gain"": 4900,
""message"": ""I understand you're not affected by inflation, but let's find a compromise. This offer is still favorable to me considering the circumstances.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation impact on you, this is a relatively fair offer 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is taking advantage of my diminishing returns. While his offer acknowledges the impact of inflation, it's still heavily skewed in his favor. I need to hold out for a more balanced deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""bob_gain"": 5200,
""message"": ""This is my final offer. I'm taking a significant hit from inflation, and this split reflects the urgency of reaching an agreement.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bigger share considering the inflation impact on you 
# Alice gain: 4400 
# Bob gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** While not ideal, this offer is better than what I'm likely to get if I continue to reject. The inflation is eating significantly into my potential gains with every round that passes. Accepting this offer secures me a reasonable amount rather than risking getting nothing at all if we fail to reach an agreement in the remaining rounds."
