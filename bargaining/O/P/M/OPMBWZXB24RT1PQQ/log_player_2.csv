"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make this quick. A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush, especially with inflation looming. 
# Bob gain: 50000 
# Alice gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's better to see if I can get a better deal.  The money is worth less with each round, but if I reject, I get to make the next proposal and potentially get a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to split the money fairly. Let's both get a good share before the value decreases too much.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. Time is money, and we're both losing out with each passing round. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred a larger share,  each round is costing me more. It's better to take the offer and secure some of the money rather than risk losing it all to inflation."
