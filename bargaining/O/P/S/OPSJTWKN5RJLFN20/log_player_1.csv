```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

I'm rejecting this offer because I'm hoping to get a better deal, considering the money is still worth a significant amount."

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's try to make a deal""

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 5% less than the previous round, my potential gain is now worth $3,657.45 (5% of $3,859.70 is $192.985, so $3,859.70 - $192.985 = $3,666.715, rounded to $3,657.45).

# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 22.62% less than the original $10,000, my gain of $5,000 is now worth $3,848.10.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
