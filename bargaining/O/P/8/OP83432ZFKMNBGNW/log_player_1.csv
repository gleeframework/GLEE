"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 

This is a classic ultimatum game with the twist of inflation. As Alice, I want to maximize my gains, and I'm assuming Bob is rational and will try to do the same. 

Starting with a 90/10 split is a good strategy because:

* **It's a strong opening offer:** This shows Bob I'm not afraid to be assertive.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects, I know he'll be the one to propose in the next round, and he'll likely have to offer me a better deal to get my acceptance. 
* **Inflation plays a role:** While I don't know how inflation affects Bob, I know it's a factor in his decision-making as well. This might make him more likely to accept an offer in the earlier rounds to avoid the risk of getting less later. 

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
