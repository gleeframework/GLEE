"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

 I'm proposing a 990,000/10,000 split in my favor. This is a generous offer, considering the inflation that will affect the money in the next round. It's in Bob's best interest to accept now and secure a small portion of the money, rather than risk getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
 While I'd prefer to have a larger portion of the money, accepting this offer is the best course of action. The inflation rate makes it clear that the money will be worth significantly less in future rounds, and I'm not confident I can secure a better deal. A 50/50 split ensures I get a significant amount, which is more important than potentially losing everything due to inflation."
