"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose to take $90 and give Bob $10. This seems like a fair starting point, as it's a significant share for me, but still gives Bob something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer.  While it's tempting to take $45, I'm confident I can do better.  Bob's offer doesn't reflect the inflation differential, and I'm willing to risk another round to get a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 72, ""bob_gain"": 28}
```

I'm going to propose a slightly lower offer for myself this time, but still a significant gain. I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to negotiate and that a deal can be reached."
