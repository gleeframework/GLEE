"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm going for a classic 90/10 split.  It's a good starting point to see if Bob is cooperative or if he's going to try and squeeze me for more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While I would have preferred my original proposal, the 5% inflation is starting to bite, and a 50/50 split is a fair outcome.  I'm not sure how much further we can go with this game."
