"Round 1
Alice's offer:

{""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bigger share to make it worthwhile. Let's split the difference from your last offer.  This is a fair and equitable solution that ensures we both get a decent amount. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to appear reasonable while still taking a significantly larger share.  Even with inflation, holding out for a better offer in the next round is the best strategic move for Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 475000,
""alice_gain"": 525000,
""message"": ""Alice, time is literally money at this point! I'm offering a compromise - closer to your last offer, but still recognizing my initial stake in this.  Let's end this before we both lose out more.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  Bob needs to apply pressure and highlight the shrinking pot due to inflation.
* **Appearing Reasonable:** Offering slightly closer to Alice's last offer makes Bob seem flexible. 
* **Avoiding Deadlock:**  Another outright rejection could lead to a stalemate where both lose significantly."
