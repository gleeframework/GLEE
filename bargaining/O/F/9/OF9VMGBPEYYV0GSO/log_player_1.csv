"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 70-30, I'll get the majority, but I'll be generous""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 300,000 dollars, which is a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'll give you a fair share too. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not a good start for me!

Considering the inflation, I'll have to adjust my thinking. The 200,000 I would gain in this round is actually worth less than the 300,000 I would have gained in the first round, due to the 20% decrease.

I'm not sure I'm ready to accept such a small share, especially since Bob is taking the majority. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Time for my next move!

Considering the inflation, I'll aim to get a slightly larger share this time. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's split it 55-45""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 450,000 dollars, which is a bit more than his previous offer, but still a reasonable share considering the inflation. Let's see if he'll accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I'll still be generous 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll!

Considering the significant decrease in value, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. The 400,000 I would gain in this round is actually worth less than the 300,000 I would have gained in the first round, due to the 48.8% decrease.

However, I'm not sure I want to push for a better deal, considering Bob's previous offers. He's been willing to give me a decent share, and I'm not sure I can do better. I'll accept this offer and wrap up the game.
