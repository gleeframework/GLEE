""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer was quite cheeky! Let's be fair, I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. It accounts for the risk I'm taking by rejecting your offer, and it's still a good deal for you considering inflation.""

Round 3

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's compromise. I'll take slightly less than your offer, but I think this is a fair deal for both of us.  Remember, the money is losing value each round.  Let's get this done.

# Alice gain: 550000
