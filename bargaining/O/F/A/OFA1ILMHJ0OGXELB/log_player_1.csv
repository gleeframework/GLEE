"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose a split of 90 dollars for me and 10 dollars for Bob. This seems like a fair initial offer considering the potential for inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I'm still aiming for a majority of the money, but I've lowered my demand slightly to 85 dollars for me and 15 dollars for Bob.  This reflects the increasing impact of inflation while still providing a significant advantage for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is more equitable than his previous offer, it's still significantly unfavorable to me. I'm willing to take the risk and continue negotiating, as inflation will make the future cost of rejecting his offers even lower."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm lowering my offer again to 80 dollars for me and 20 dollars for Bob. This reflects the continued impact of inflation, but I'm still trying to maintain a substantial advantage. I believe this offer is a fair compromise considering the potential for future inflation to further reduce the value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is closer to a 50/50 split than before, but I'm still hoping for a better deal. With inflation increasing, the value of the money I would receive is decreasing rapidly, but I'm willing to take the risk and continue negotiating."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}
```

I'm lowering my offer once more to 75 dollars for me and 25 dollars for Bob. This offer reflects the increasing impact of inflation on the value of the money. While I'm willing to compromise further, I believe this is still a fair deal considering the diminishing value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 25 
# Bob gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Although Bob's offer is more equitable than before, I'm still hoping for a better deal.  The inflation is hurting both of us, but I believe I can still get a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm lowering my offer one last time to 70 dollars for me and 30 dollars for Bob. With inflation rapidly decreasing the value of the money, I need to secure a deal before it's too late. While I'm giving up more ground, this is still a reasonable offer considering the circumstances."
