"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need for further negotiations""
}
```

I'm making a fair offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value due to inflation, my gain of 40 is actually worth 38 (since 100 - 5% = 95, and 95 * 0.4 = 38).

I'll have to decide whether to accept Bob's offer. Considering the initial offer was 50/50, and now he's offering me 38, which is a significant decrease, I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the previous offers and the decreasing value of the money due to inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the current value of the money.

Since the money is now worth 95% of its original value, I'll aim for a higher percentage of the remaining value. I'll offer Bob a lower percentage of the original 100, but still a decent amount considering the reduced value.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 45 is a fair share""
}
```

This way, I'm keeping a slightly higher percentage of the remaining value, but still giving Bob a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 42, but I think I'm getting closer to a fair share 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual value of the money I would gain from Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 85.74% of its original value (100 - 14.26%), and I would gain 42, I would actually receive 42 * 0.8574 = 36.01.

Considering the previous offers and the decreasing value of the money, I think 36.01 is a relatively good offer. I'll accept this offer.
