"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}
``` 
 
This offer is designed to be fair, but also gives me a significant advantage since I'm the first to propose.  I believe Bob will accept it, as he gets something, but we'll see!  Let me know what he decides."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly better than the 5% reduced value of my original proposal. Accepting this ensures I get a substantial share of the money, even with the inflation factor."
