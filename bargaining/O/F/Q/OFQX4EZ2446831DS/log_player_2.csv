"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, let's try this again. This offer acknowledges the time pressure while still being reasonable for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5800,
""alice_gain"": 4200,
""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking, and frankly, your offers aren't reflecting the urgency. This is my final offer.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is it.  A 50/50 split is the only fair offer at this point. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

At this point, accepting a 50/50 split is the best option for Bob. Here's why:

* **Severe Inflation:** Bob is losing value rapidly with each round. A 50/50 split, even though seemingly unfair in earlier rounds, is now the best he can realistically achieve.
* **Alice's Stance:**  Alice's message suggests she's unwilling to budge further.  Rejecting this offer means risking an even worse outcome for Bob in the next round."
