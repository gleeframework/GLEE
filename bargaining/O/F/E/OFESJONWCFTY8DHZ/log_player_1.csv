"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $1,000,000, leaving Bob with $200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll have to reassess the offer.

In this round, the money is worth 90% of the previous round's value, so my gain of $500,000 is actually worth $450,000.

I'll decide to accept this offer.
