Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I believe a slightly higher share for me is reasonable as the money's value will decrease with each round. This way, we both still get a significant amount before its value drops further. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
