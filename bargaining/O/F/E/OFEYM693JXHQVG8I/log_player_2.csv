"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split close to even, Bob, but factor in a slight advantage for me since I'm making the first offer. This ensures we both benefit before inflation cuts into it too much.

# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I believe a slightly higher share for me is reasonable as the money's value will decrease with each round. This way, we both still get a significant amount before its value drops further.""}\n\n###"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want to maximize our gains.  Let's stop wasting time with unequal offers and the risk of further inflation. A clean 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical outcome here. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000
