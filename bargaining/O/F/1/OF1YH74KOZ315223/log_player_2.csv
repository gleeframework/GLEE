"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair.  I'll take the majority, but you get a decent share.  Accept, and we both win.

# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're both losing money with each round.  Let's split the difference from your last offer - we both get a decent amount, and we stop losing value. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to anchor me to my previous offer, but it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  Given the faster inflation rate I face, I need to push for a more significant gain in the next round."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
