"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""bob_gain"": 6000
}
```

I'm offering Bob 60% of the initial $10,000 and keeping 40% for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, so I'll have to adjust my decision accordingly.

I accept Bob's offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
