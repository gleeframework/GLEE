"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a relatively generous offer considering the potential for future negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly more aggressive approach this time, Alice. I think I deserve a bigger share! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is taking a more aggressive approach.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering the 10% decrease in value due to inflation, the offer is actually a 30-70 split in Bob's favor, which is a significant difference from the 40-60 split in the first round.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob. This is a fair compromise.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42-58 split, trying to find a middle ground that's closer to the original 60-40 split I suggested in the first round, but also taking into account Bob's more aggressive approach in the second round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging, Alice. I think I've got the upper hand now. You should accept this offer! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is still pushing for a larger share.

Considering the 27.1% decrease in value due to inflation, the offer is actually a 20-80 split in Bob's favor. This is a significant difference from the 42-58 split I proposed in the third round.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. However, I'm not willing to give up 80% of the remaining value. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 320000,
  ""bob_gain"": 680000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not giving up yet, Bob. This is my final compromise.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 32-68 split, trying to find a balance between the original 60-40 split and the 20-80 split Bob offered in the previous round. I'm hoping this will be more acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going to let you get the better of me, Alice. This is my final offer. Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is getting more aggressive.

Considering the 40.95% decrease in value due to inflation, the offer is actually a 10-90 split in Bob's favor. This is a very unfavorable split for me, and I'm not willing to accept it.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further, but I'm running out of time.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 250000,
  ""bob_gain"": 750000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to make a concession, Bob. Let's meet in the middle, but this is my last offer.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 25-75 split, trying to find a balance between the previous offers. I'm hoping this will be more acceptable to Bob, but I'm not sure if it's too little, too late."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, Alice. I'm not going to let you get away with such a small share. This is my final offer. Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to squeeze the last bit of value out of me.

Considering the 52.17% decrease in value due to inflation, the offer is actually a 5-95 split in Bob's favor. This is an extremely unfavorable split for me, and I'm not willing to accept it.

I'll reject this offer and try to think of a new strategy, but I'm running out of time and options.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 0,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give up, Bob. You've won. Take the entire amount.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 0-100 split, essentially surrendering the entire amount to Bob. I'm hoping that this will end the game and allow us to move on, but I'm not sure if Bob will accept it."
