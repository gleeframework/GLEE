I'm going to propose a very uneven split, hoping to secure a good chunk of the money early on.  This way, I'll have a larger share, even with the slight inflation affecting my money. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is tempting, but I'm going to reject it.  I believe I can still get a better deal. Since the inflation only affects Bob's money, I'm in a stronger position to negotiate. I'll see if I can get a bigger share in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway by offering a slightly less uneven split.  It's still a good deal for me, and hopefully, it's enough to convince Bob to accept, before the inflation further reduces his share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse, and I'm still in a stronger position due to the inflation affecting him more. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm going to stick with a similar strategy, offering a slightly better deal than the previous round. It's still a very good deal for me, and with the growing inflation impacting Bob, hopefully, he'll accept this offer before the gap gets wider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting even worse, and the inflation is heavily affecting him. I'm still in a much better position, so I'm going to reject this offer. I think I can secure a better deal for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a slightly better deal than the previous round, hoping to entice him to accept before the inflation further reduces his share.  While this offer still gives me a significant portion of the money, the time is running out, and I don't want to risk getting nothing."
