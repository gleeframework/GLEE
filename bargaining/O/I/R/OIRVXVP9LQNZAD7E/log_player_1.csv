"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

This is a very aggressive offer, but I want to see if Bob is willing to accept even a tiny amount in the first round.  I'm hoping he'll be tempted to take something rather than risk getting nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. While it's tempting to take 400,000, I know that I can likely get more if I hold out.  Inflation is working in my favor, and I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to try a more balanced offer this round. I'm aiming for a higher share than Bob's offer, but I want to avoid pushing him away completely. I'm hoping he'll see that it's in his best interest to accept, as his share is worth less with each passing round due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting this offer. While the inflation is starting to take a bigger bite, I'm still confident I can get a better deal.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to try and get a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm going to try a 50/50 split this round.  With inflation biting down, I need to start being more reasonable.  This is a fair offer, and I'm hoping Bob will recognize that accepting it is better than risking getting nothing in the later rounds."
