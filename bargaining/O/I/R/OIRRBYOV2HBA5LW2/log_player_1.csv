"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable for a starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, you can have a small share 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

After considering Bob's offer, I decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 25-75 split, especially considering the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the previous round. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a more balanced split, taking into account the inflation that's affecting my share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, take the crumbs 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my share!

After considering Bob's offer, I decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept such a paltry amount, especially considering the value of my share has decreased significantly due to inflation. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 300000,
  ""bob_gain"": 700000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting it all, Bob!""
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive in my offer, considering the value of my share has decreased significantly due to inflation. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're running out of time, take the tiny share 
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","The clock is ticking, and the value of my share is dwindling rapidly!

After considering Bob's offer, I decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept such a tiny share, even if it's a slight improvement from the previous offer. I'll try to squeeze out a better deal in the next round, but I'm running out of time and options!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 200000,
  ""bob_gain"": 800000,
  ""message"": ""Last chance, Bob! Meet me at 50-50!""
}
```

I'm making one final push for a more balanced split, hoping Bob will see the value in sharing the remaining amount more equally. It's my last chance to negotiate a decent deal before the game ends!"
