"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, but I'm sure you understand the power of the first offer! 
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
I'm not going to accept that offer! 10,000 dollars is not a fair share of 1 million. I'll take my chances with a counter-offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""bob_gain"": 900000,
""alice_gain"": 100000,
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable. I'm offering a fair split - 90% for me, 10% for you. We both get something, and we move on.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving up a huge chunk. This is the best offer you'll get. Accept and let's end this before the inflation gets worse for me. 
# Bob gain: 50000 
# Alice gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm still not convinced. I can do better than 50,000. Let's see what happens in the next round."
