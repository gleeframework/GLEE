"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 65/35 split is more fair, considering the inflation difference. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not convinced that a 65/35 split is fair, considering that the money is worth 20% less for me and only 5% less for Bob. I'd like to make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""I'll accept a slightly larger split for you, but 45/55 is the best I can do.""}

I'm proposing a 45/55 split, trying to compromise and give Bob a slightly better deal, while still getting a decent share for myself."
