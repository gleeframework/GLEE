{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""

This is a straightforward proposal, offering Bob a 50/50 split. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or reject this offer!"

# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants to take a bigger share this time!

I'll reject this offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's an insult! I want a better deal!""
}
```

# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to rub it in my face one last time!

I'll reject this offer as well. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You've gone too far, I'd rather walk away with nothing!""
}
```

I'm not going to accept a single dollar share, that's just humiliating. Since we've reached the 12th round, I suppose we'll have to walk away with nothing. Better luck next time, Bob!"
