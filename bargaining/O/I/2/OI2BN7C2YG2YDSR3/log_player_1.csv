Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}

This is a 50-50 split, a fair and straightforward proposal. Now it's Bob's turn!"

Round 2

}"

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll try to make a more reasonable offer this time.

# Alice gain: 50000

}"

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time, given Bob's previous attempts to lowball me.

  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}

This is an 90-10 split, which is a pretty significant advantage for me. Let's see if Bob will accept it!"

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I think I've had enough of Bob's ridiculous offers. It's time for a very aggressive counteroffer.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 999000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000
}

This is a 99.9-0.1 split, which is essentially the opposite of Bob's last offer. Let's see if he'll accept it!"
