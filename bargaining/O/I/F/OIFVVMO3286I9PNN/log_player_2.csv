"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, but that's not very fair to me. How about a 55/45 split?""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can do 58-42, it's a compromise. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""This is getting ridiculous. I'm offering you almost half. Take it or leave it.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting desperate, I can see. 57-43 is my new offer. 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage. While time is running out, accepting a deal where I get less than 50% after inflation is a losing scenario. I need to show firmness to make her see that a more balanced deal is necessary."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""This is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the only fair outcome. Accept it, or we both lose.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your 'final offer' wasn't final, was it? I'm still not budging much. 
# Bob gain: 41 
# Alice gain: 59 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The game has reached a critical point. While 41 is much lower than I'd like, rejecting this offer means risking an even lower amount in subsequent rounds due to the accelerating inflation. Alice is unlikely to budge significantly, and the risk of getting nothing at all is too high now. It's a disappointing outcome, but better than walking away empty-handed."
