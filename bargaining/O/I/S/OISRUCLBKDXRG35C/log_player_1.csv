"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. What do you say, Bob?""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slight adjustment from my previous offer, Alice. I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, the offer from Bob is actually a 50-50 split, which is a significant concession from his initial offer.

I think this is a fair compromise, so I accept the offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
