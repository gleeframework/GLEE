**Reasoning:**

Alice is stubbornly sticking close to her original offer. While the gap is narrowing, it's not narrowing fast enough to offset the impact of inflation on my end. I need to show her I'm serious about getting a more significant share, or the inflation will make even accepting her ""compromises"" a bad deal."
