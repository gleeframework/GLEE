"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's start with a fair split. I propose I take $55 and you take $45.  It's better to secure a deal early before inflation eats away at our potential earnings.

# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I think a more even split is fairer. How about we switch it up for this round?""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The clock is ticking and inflation is eating our money. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both benefit. Let's close this deal now. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
