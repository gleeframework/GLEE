"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 7:3, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 7:3 split, where I take 700,000 and Bob takes 300,000. I think this is a good starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about meeting in the middle, as I was hoping to get a better deal. I think I can do better than 50/50. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'll compromise, but I want a slight edge""}

I'm proposing a 55:45 split, where I take 550,000 and Bob takes 450,000. I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still hoping to get a slightly better deal than the 50/50 split Bob offered earlier."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slight edge, but not that much! 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm starting to get a bit desperate, and Bob's offer is actually quite reasonable. I'll accept the 47.5:52.5 split, where I take 475,000 and Bob takes 525,000. It's not the best deal I could have hoped for, but it's better than nothing!"
