"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 80% and you take 20%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split in my favor, which is a fair starting point, I think."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll start with a 50/50 split. Your turn to decide. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $5000 is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, which is $4000. I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, as it's a 50-50 split, but I'd be getting less than I would have in the first round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, the $10,000 is now worth 64% of its original value (80% of 80%). I'll make a new offer that takes this into account.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6400,
  ""bob_gain"": 3600,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a smaller share this time. Let's see if you'll accept""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but still a fair one. Your turn to decide. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $4000 is now worth 40% of what it was in the first round, which is $3200. I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, as it's still a relatively small share, but I'd be getting more than I would in the next round.
