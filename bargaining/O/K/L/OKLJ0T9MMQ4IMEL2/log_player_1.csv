"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, a fair starting point!""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob gets 20%. I think this is a fair starting point, and we can negotiate from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a more balanced split, 3:2 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too thrilled about the 3:2 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Since the money is worth less now, I'm looking for a better deal.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now, hoping to negotiate further in future rounds.
