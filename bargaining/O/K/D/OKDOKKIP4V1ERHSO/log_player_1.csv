"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 20% of the total.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split, with me getting $8,000 and Bob getting $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split that accounts for our different inflation rates. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer, considering the inflation rates.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I think the split is a bit too skewed towards you, considering the inflation rates. I'd like to see a more balanced split.""
}
```

I'm not convinced that this split is fair, considering the inflation rates. I'd like to make my own proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation rates, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway. This split should be more balanced, considering the inflation rates.""
}
```"
