"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable for a starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started with a fair offer, but I think I can do better. This is a slightly more generous offer from me. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to squeeze a bit more out of the deal.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that this offer is significantly more generous, and I'm not willing to give up 10% of the remaining money just yet. Let's see what Bob comes up with next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""You're trying to squeeze a bit too much, Bob. Let's find a middle ground.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping a slight edge for myself. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not getting any younger, and I think I deserve a bigger share. This is my best offer so far. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is hitting me hard!

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give up nearly 70% of the remaining money, especially considering the value of my share is decreasing rapidly due to inflation. I'll try to negotiate a better deal next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""bob_gain"": 600000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not getting any younger either, Bob. Let's meet in the middle before it's too late!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and not giving up too much to inflation. Hopefully, Bob will see reason this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not backing down, Alice. I think I deserve the lion's share, and this is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the value of my potential gain is dwindling rapidly!

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a share that's less than 10% of the original amount, especially when it's worth so much less due to inflation. I'll try to hold out for a better deal, but it's getting increasingly difficult."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 250000,
  ""bob_gain"": 750000,
  ""message"": ""I'm running out of options, Bob. Let's split it 50-50 before it's too late!""
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive and offer a 50-50 split, hoping that Bob will see the value in not leaving the table empty-handed."
