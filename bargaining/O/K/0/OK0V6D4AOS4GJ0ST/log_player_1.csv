"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""
}
```

I'm offering to take $60 and give Bob $40. Let me know if he accepts or not!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not happy with Bob's offer, so I'll reject it and make a new proposal in the next round. The inflation is hurting me more than Bob, but I think I can still get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 3:


{
  ""alice_gain"": 57,
  ""bob_gain"": 43,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, considering inflation""

I'm taking into account the inflation and trying to find a middle ground. Let's see if Bob accepts this offer!"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is hitting you harder, I'll take a bit more 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{ ""decision"": ""accept"" }\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on my gains, I think it's time to accept Bob's offer and cut my losses. The difference between our proposals is getting smaller, and further rounds will only make things worse for me. Time to settle!"
