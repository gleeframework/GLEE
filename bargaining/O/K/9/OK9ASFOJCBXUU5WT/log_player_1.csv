"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

This means I'm offering to take $800,000 and leave $200,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","Thanks for the update on the offer from Bob.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that I should take a smaller share, even with a slightly larger amount. I'll hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more than half of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value quickly due to inflation! Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a smaller share than I proposed in Round 3, especially considering the money is worth less now due to inflation. I'll try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 650000,
  ""bob_gain"": 350000,
  ""message"": ""Getting closer, Bob. Meet me at 65-35!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise that's closer to my original proposal in Round 3, but still leaves room for Bob to get a decent share."
