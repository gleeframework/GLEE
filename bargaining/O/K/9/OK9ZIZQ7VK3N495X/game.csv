55.0,45.0,Let's start fair!  I propose a 55/45 split in my favor.  I think it's a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
40.0,60.0,"I'm willing to compromise. How about a 60/40 split in my favor? It's still a fair deal, considering the starting point was 55/45 in your favor.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
50.0,50.0,"Okay, let's be reasonable. I understand you want a larger share, but inflation is affecting me too.  A 50/50 split is fair given the circumstances.  Let's end this before the value of the money drops further.",Alice,3,
