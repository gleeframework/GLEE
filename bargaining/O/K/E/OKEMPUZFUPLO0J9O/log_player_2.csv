"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'm hoping we can agree on this and end the game quickly. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Please let me know when it's my turn.\n\n###\n\nCan I make my proposal now? I'd like to propose a 60-40 split in my favor, with the reasoning that I'm taking on more risk by not accepting Alice's initial offer and proceeding to the next round, where the money is worth less due to inflation.\n\n###\n\nMy offer:\n# My message: Considering the inflation, I think I deserve a bit more. Let's try to find a mutually beneficial agreement.\n# Bob gain: 600000\n# Alice gain: 400000\n\nPlease relay this to Alice."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","My offer hasn't changed. Here it is in JSON format as requested:\n\n{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think I deserve a bit more. Let's try to find a mutually beneficial agreement.""}\n\nPlease let me know Alice's decision.\n\n###\n\nAlso, just to confirm, since we're in Round 2, the money is now worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Alice, correct? That means the total value we're dividing is effectively less for both of us, but more so for me. This impacts our calculations for future rounds.\n\n###\n\nLooking forward to Alice's response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger share to make this worthwhile after the inflation. Let's find a solution we can both agree on. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make another counteroffer. Given the increasing impact of inflation, I believe I need to adjust my proposal to better reflect the changing value of the money.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know when it's my turn again.\n\n###\n\nI'll make sure to consider the current worth of the money for both of us in my next proposal, taking into account that it's now worth 36% less for me and 9.75% less for Alice compared to the first round.\n\n###\n\nCan I make my next proposal now?\n\n###\n\nMy offer:\n# My message: Given the significant impact of inflation on my end, I think a more balanced split considering the current values is necessary.\n# Bob gain: 550000\n# Alice gain: 450000\n\nPlease relay this to Alice.\n\n###\n\nLet's see if we can reach an agreement in the next round."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Given the significant impact of inflation on my end, I think a more balanced split considering the current values is necessary.""}\n\nPlease let me know Alice's decision.\n\n###\n\nConsidering we're in Round 4, I'm eager to find a mutually acceptable solution before the value of the money decreases further. The current split I've proposed takes into account the adjusted values due to inflation, aiming for a compromise that both of us can agree on.\n\n###\n\nLooking forward to Alice's response.\n\n###\n\nAlso, just to confirm, could you please update me on the exact worth of the money for both of us in this round, considering the ongoing inflation? This will be crucial for planning my next steps if Alice rejects this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway.  This offer considers the inflation but allows us both to walk away with something reasonable.  Let's end this game. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation, particularly on my end where the money is now worth 59.04% less than in the first round, I believe accepting this offer is the best course of action. The gap between our valuations due to inflation has grown substantially, and this offer seems to be a reasonable compromise given the circumstances.\n\n###\n\nAlice's willingness to meet halfway and consider the effects of inflation in her proposal suggests a genuine attempt to find a mutually beneficial agreement. Given the decreasing value of the money, especially for me, it's prudent to accept this offer and conclude the game rather than risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds.\n\n###\n\nI'm satisfied with the outcome, considering the dynamics of the game and the impact of inflation on our negotiations. Thank you for facilitating this game!"
