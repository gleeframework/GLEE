"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, a fair and simple beginning""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start, giving each of us $500,000. This is a reasonable and straightforward way to begin the game, and it gives us both a decent chunk of the total amount."
