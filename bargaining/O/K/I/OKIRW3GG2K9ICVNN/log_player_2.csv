"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This gives us both a good deal. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

I'm not sure if this is a good deal yet. Let's see what Alice offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. This gives us both a good foundation to work with.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is ticking and we're both losing out. I'm being more flexible now, let's get this done. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Alice is offering me more than in the first round and the money I gain is still worth the same. I'd rather secure a decent amount now than risk getting nothing in later rounds."
