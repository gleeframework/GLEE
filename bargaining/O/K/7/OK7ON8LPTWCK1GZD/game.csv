5700.0,4300.0,"Bob, time is money, and it's losing value fast! I'm coming down a bit to $5,700, but let's close this deal now before inflation eats away at our gains further.",Alice,3,

5400.0,4600.0,"Bob, I'm sensing some reluctance here.  I'm dropping my offer to $5,400.  Let's be practical, every round costs us both.  Agree now and we both walk away with something.",Alice,5,
