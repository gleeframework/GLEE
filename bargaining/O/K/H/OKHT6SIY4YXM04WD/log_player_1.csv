"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

``` 

I'm going for a big chunk, but I'm also leaving Bob with something to hopefully encourage him to accept. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is worse than my original proposal, even with the inflation. I'll reject and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm reducing my share again, but I'm confident this is still a good deal for both of us, given the inflation. Let's see if Bob will be more reasonable this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still very unfair, even with the inflation considered.  I'm sticking to my strategy of offering a more balanced split and hoping he'll come around eventually."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm taking a smaller share, but I'm still offering a significant amount to Bob. The inflation is starting to get serious, so I need to be more flexible while still holding out for a decent cut."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still not happy with this offer. It's true that inflation is eating away at the value of the money, but I'm not going to cave in just yet.  I'm holding out for a better split, and I'm confident I can get it."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

We're getting close to the end, and inflation is getting more serious. This is a generous offer on my part, but I still need to secure a decent share.  I hope Bob will see this as a good compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is getting frustrating!  While I'm getting closer to a 50/50 split, I'm still not satisfied with this offer.  I believe I can get a better deal if I keep rejecting and pushing for a more equitable division."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

This is a 50/50 split, which is the fairest outcome in my opinion.  Given the current inflation rate, I believe it's a good deal for both of us. It's time for Bob to be reasonable!"
