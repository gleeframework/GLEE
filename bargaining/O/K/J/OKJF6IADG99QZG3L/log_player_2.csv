"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, it's my turn to make a new one. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of 40 in this round is actually worth less than my gain of 50 in the first round. I'm not sure if Alice's gain is worth the same as in the first round, but I'll assume it is.

Since I rejected Alice's offer in the first round, I'm not sure if she'll make a better offer this time. However, 40 is a relatively low amount for me, considering the initial offer was 50. I'll take a chance and accept this offer.
