I'm starting with a seemingly generous offer to Bob, but I want to keep the majority for myself. It's a risky strategy, but it's worth a shot."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to get the better deal. I'm not going to let him get away with that. Let's see if he's willing to be more reasonable in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer, but I'm still aiming for a larger share. I believe that Bob will start to see that his strategy of taking all the money for himself isn't going to work. This round is crucial to establish a baseline for future negotiations."
