"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see what kind of offer Alice will make in the next round.  While 4000$ is tempting, I think I can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than last round. Let's split the difference this time.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Time is running out 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though the money is worth less for me, I'm afraid if I reject, Alice will offer even less in the next round. It's better to take what I can get."
