"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $4000, which is 40% of the total amount, and I'll take $6000, which is 60%. I've included the message ""Let's be fair"" to convey that I believe this is a reasonable and equitable split. Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than last round. Let's split the difference this time. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can get a better deal in the next round, considering the inflation affects Bob's gain more than mine. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll offer Bob $3500, which is less than what he offered me in the previous round, considering the inflation factor. I'll take $6500 for myself. The message ""Time is running out"" is meant to convey that the longer we play, the less valuable the money becomes for Bob, so he should consider accepting this offer.
