"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 70% and you can take 30%. We can discuss further if you'd like to negotiate.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, which is a relatively fair starting point. I'm leaving some room for negotiation, though, in case Bob wants to make a counteroffer."
