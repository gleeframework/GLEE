"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I think we can both agree on this.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $60 and Bob getting $40. I'm hoping this will set a good tone for the game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a slightly more even split is fair, Alice.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 5% less for me, so I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think a 49-51 split is a reasonable compromise, and I'm willing to accept it to move on to the next round."
