"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets the remaining 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60-40 is a fairer split, with me getting a bit more since I'm the one making the offer this round. Let's make a deal! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not convinced that Bob's offer is fair, especially since the money is worth less now due to inflation. I was willing to consider a 60-40 split initially, but Bob's offer is now even more skewed towards him. I'd like to propose a new offer and see if we can find a more balanced split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share, but I still think 45-55 is a fairer split considering the inflation.""}

I'm proposing that I get 45% of the remaining $100, which is $45, and Bob gets the remaining 55%, which is $55."
