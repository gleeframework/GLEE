Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share, but I still think 45-55 is a fairer split considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll take the 55% this round.  The inflation is starting to hurt, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all."
