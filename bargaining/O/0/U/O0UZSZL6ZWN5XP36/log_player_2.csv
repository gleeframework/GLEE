"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and you get 10%, but we can negotiate further. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm not going to accept a 90/10 split right off the bat. I'm hoping to get a better deal. Let's see what Alice offers next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm offering a 60/40 split.  Let's be reasonable and avoid risking the entire pot.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but 60/40 is too unbalanced. Let's meet in the middle with 70/30.  Remember, inflation is hitting you harder than me. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I would prefer a more even split, I'm worried that if I reject again, inflation will make things worse for me in the next round. Accepting this offer is the safest option to ensure I get something."
