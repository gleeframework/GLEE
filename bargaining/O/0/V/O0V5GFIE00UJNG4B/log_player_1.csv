"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the original $100, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less due to inflation, I will have to adjust my gain accordingly.

In the first round, I would have gotten $60, but due to inflation, it's worth 95% of that amount, which is $57.

Bob's offer in the second round is $40, which is worth 80% of the original $100. So, in terms of the original value, I would get $80.

Since $57 is less than $80, I reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the 5% inflation, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 95% of its original value, I'll aim to get a larger share to account for the decrease in value.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```"
