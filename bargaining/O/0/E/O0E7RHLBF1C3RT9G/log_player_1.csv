"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering 60% of the initial $1,000,000 to myself and 40% to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $400,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, so it's equivalent to $360,000. Bob's gain of $600,000 is now worth 80% of its original value, so it's equivalent to $480,000.

I'm not happy with this offer, so I'll reject it.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the decreasing value of money. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm offering 70% of the current $1,000,000 to myself and 30% to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the equivalent value of the gains in the first round.

My gain of $700,000 in round 3 is worth 72.9% of its original value, so it's equivalent to $507,300.

Bob's gain of $300,000 in round 4 is worth 52.2% of its original value, so it's equivalent to $156,600.

However, Bob's offer is for $300,000, which is worth 30% of the original $1,000,000. This is a relatively small share, but I'll consider it.

I'll accept this offer.
