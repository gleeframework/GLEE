I'm going to start with a fairly generous offer, hoping to secure a quick win. I'll keep 90% for myself, leaving 10% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is a complete reversal of mine.  I'm not going to accept that!  I'll counter with my own offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to reduce my share slightly, but still offer a decent portion to Bob. I hope this will be enough to persuade him to accept, as inflation is starting to bite."
