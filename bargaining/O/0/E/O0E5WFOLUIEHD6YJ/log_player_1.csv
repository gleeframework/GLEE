"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need for further negotiations.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game on a good note!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I think I deserve more for being the first to propose. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not a bad offer, but I'm not willing to give up too much. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is starting to take its toll, but I'll try to make a counteroffer. Here's my proposal:

```

  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I think I deserve a larger share for being a tough negotiator.""
}
