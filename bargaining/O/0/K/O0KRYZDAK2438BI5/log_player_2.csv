"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I take a bit more to start, but we both win big! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. The current proposal gives Alice a significantly larger share, and I believe we can negotiate a more balanced split. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground. Given the inflation, it's wise for both of us to secure a deal sooner rather than later.""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn, Alice!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate the sentiment. How about we swap numbers from your last offer? It seems fair considering we're both losing money by waiting. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the impact of inflation, accepting this offer seems prudent. Waiting further would only decrease the value of the money, and Alice's offer, although not perfectly balanced, is reasonable given the circumstances. Let's finalize the deal before the value drops further!"
