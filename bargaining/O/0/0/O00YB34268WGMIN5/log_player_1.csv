"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

I propose a division of $9,000 for me and $1,000 for Bob.  This is a generous offer to start, given that the money will lose value for me in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
 
While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best strategy. Due to inflation, each round that passes will reduce the value of my potential earnings.  Accepting this offer ensures I get at least something."
