"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $4000 and keep $6000 for myself, with a message suggesting a fair division. This way, I'm showing willingness to share but also ensuring I get a slightly larger portion. Since the value of money doesn't decrease for me but does for Bob, I'm in a stronger negotiating position, and starting with a higher offer for myself sets the stage for potential future negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better with a more equitable split. Let's try this. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Although Bob's suggestion aims for a more equitable split, considering the inflation that affects Bob's gain but not mine, I believe I can negotiate for a better deal. The fact that the money's value remains constant for me but decreases for Bob gives me a strategic advantage. By rejecting this offer, I aim to leverage this advantage in the next round, potentially securing a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a fairer split""}\n\nIn this round, I'll offer Bob $4200 and keep $5800 for myself, emphasizing that considering the inflation affecting Bob's gain, this split is more equitable than it initially seems. The message aims to reason with Bob, highlighting the impact of inflation, which I hope will make the offer more palatable. By slightly decreasing my initial offer, I show a willingness to compromise while still leveraging the strategic advantage provided by the inflation dynamic."
