"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that. Let's be more equitable! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\n### My next offer: {""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle!""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Getting closer!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle. It's the fairest solution. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nIt looks like after several rounds of negotiation, I'm willing to accept Bob's offer to split the money 50/50. The effects of inflation have reduced the value of the money, and it seems like meeting in the middle is a reasonable compromise. I'm choosing to end the game here and walk away with $50, even though it's worth less than it would have been in the first round."
