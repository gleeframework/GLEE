Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your offer was tempting Bob, but ultimately unfair considering the inflation. Let's settle this before it gets any worse for you. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is trying to use the inflation against me, but she's undervaluing how much it will hurt me later. I need to push for a more significant share while I still have some leverage."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Accept this offer, or we both lose out.  Time is literally money for you. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is getting desperate, which means I still have bargaining power. Accepting now would mean losing out on a significant sum, even with the inflation. I need to hold my nerve."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm sticking to my guns on this one. A 55/45 split is fair considering the circumstances. Let's end this here and both walk away with something substantial.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm compromising one last time.  This is the definition of fair considering the rapidly devaluing pot.  Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice is right.  The deal is getting worse with each round, and I need to be realistic.  While not ideal, 400,000 is still a significant amount of money, and it's better than walking away with nothing if I continue to push my luck."
