"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80/20, I'll take the risk of inflation""
}
```

This offer gives me $8,000 and Bob $2,000. I'm proposing a 4:1 split, which is a relatively generous offer considering the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a smaller share, but still a fair one. Your turn! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my $8,000 from Round 1 is now worth $6,400, and Bob's $2,000 is now worth $3,600.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll accept the offer since it's a better deal for me than the original proposal. I'll take the $6,000 and call it a day.
