Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. 60/40 seems fair to me considering the inflation.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Bob. How about 5800 for me and 4200 for you? This accounts for the inflation a bit better while still being a decent deal for you. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer seems to acknowledge the inflation, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  The decreasing value of the money hurts me more than it does her as the game goes on. I need to push for a more equitable split soon or risk getting a much worse deal in later rounds."
