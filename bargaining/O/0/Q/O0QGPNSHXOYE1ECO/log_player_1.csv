"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a very lopsided offer in the first round.  Since the money is worth less to Bob with each passing round, I'm hoping to get most of the money now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's a fair offer, and it's better than the risk of getting nothing if we keep playing."
