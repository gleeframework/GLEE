"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60-40""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a fair and reasonable starting point. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject the offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, you can't refuse 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is already taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully. With the 20% decrease in value due to inflation, I'd be getting only 2000 dollars, which is worth significantly less than the 6000 I could have gotten in the first round.

However, I'm not sure if I can afford to be too picky, since the game is already in the second round and the value of the money will continue to decrease. I'll have to weigh the potential benefits of waiting for a better offer against the risk of getting a worse deal later on.

For now, I'll decide to reject Bob's offer and hope for a better deal in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth 40% less due to inflation. I'll have to adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3000,
  ""bob_gain"": 7000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a fair share""
}
```

I'm proposing a 30-70 split, which is a bit more skewed towards Bob's favor, but I'm hoping it's still reasonable considering the decreasing value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take it all, you're getting desperate 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking its toll now! The money is worth a fraction of its original value, and Bob's offer is reflecting that.

While I'm not thrilled about the prospect of getting only 1000 dollars, I have to consider the fact that the value of money is decreasing rapidly. If I reject this offer, the value of the money will continue to drop, and I might end up with even less.

I'm not sure if I'm ""getting desperate,"" but I do need to make a decision. Considering the rapidly decreasing value of the money, I'll decide to accept Bob's offer.
