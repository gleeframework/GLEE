"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early!""
}
```

This way, I'll get 75% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob will get 25%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think this is a good starting point. Let's see if you can do better! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting already!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll have to be more cautious. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting Bob's offer, as I think I can do better."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is taking its toll, and the money is worth 80% of its original value now.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You're trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I'm not falling for it. This is my counteroffer.""
}
```

I'm aiming for a more balanced split, considering the reduced value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to give in too easily. Let's see if you can do better! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a bite out of my potential earnings.

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll have to be more aggressive in my next offer. However, I'll accept Bob's offer this time, as it's a decent compromise.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the 400,000 and call it a day."
