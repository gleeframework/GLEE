"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $5,000. This is a fair and straightforward offer, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer. You can consider this one. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to negotiate a better deal. Considering the inflation rates, the money is worth less now, so I need to adjust my expectations.

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll think about it, but I'm not ready to accept yet. I'd like to propose a counteroffer.""

```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and preparing to make a counteroffer in the next round."
