"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit too much in your favor, Alice. How about a split that's a little closer to even, but still gives you a slight edge for being first? 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
