"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  This gives Bob a small share but hopefully encourages him to accept in the first round.  It's a good starting point, and I'll be willing to negotiate if he rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While this is a significant drop from my initial proposal, accepting this offer means I still get a portion of the money. Considering the inflation rate, the value of this money will continue to decrease with each passing round. It's better to secure something than risk losing it entirely."
