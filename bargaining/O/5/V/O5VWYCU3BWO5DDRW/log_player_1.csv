"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

``` 
I'm going to start with a very generous offer, hoping to end the game quickly.  I'll take $90, and Bob can have $10."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to reject this offer.  While it's tempting to take $10, I know that if I reject this offer, I get to make the offer in the next round, and inflation will have worked in my favor."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm going to offer Bob $20, and keep $80 for myself.  The inflation has worked in my favor, and I can afford to be a bit more generous, but still take the majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While it's a lot less than I initially hoped for,  the inflation is making it very hard to secure more. I'll take the $20 and end the game."
