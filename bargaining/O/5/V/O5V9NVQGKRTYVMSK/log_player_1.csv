"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 900,000$ - 100,000$ split in my favor. I believe this is a fair offer considering the potential for inflation and the fact that I am the one making the first offer.  Let's see if Bob agrees."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
This is a much better deal for me than the previous offer.  While I would have preferred a larger share, the risk of getting nothing due to inflation is too high.  I'll take the 500,000."
