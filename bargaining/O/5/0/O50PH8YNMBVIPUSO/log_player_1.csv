"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making an offer. Here is my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}

I'm offering Bob $40, which is a fair share, but I'm keeping the majority of the money for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","That's a pretty lopsided offer! I'm not going to accept it. I think I can do better than that. 

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll try to make a more balanced offer this time. Here it is:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}

Let's split it 50/50, a fair and equal share for both of us."
