"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take $900,000 and you get $100,000. What do you say?""
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping to set the tone for a fair negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I think it's a fair compromise. You can't have it all! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $400,000 is now worth 95% of what it was in the first round, which is $380,000.

I'm not thrilled with the offer, but I'm willing to compromise. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm comfortable with such a large disparity. I'd like to try to negotiate further.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth 5% less than in round 2, so my gain of $400,000 is now worth 95% of what it was in round 2, which is $361,600.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'll take $550,000 and you get $450,000. Is this more to your liking?""
}
```

This offer is a bit more aggressive than my initial offer, but I'm trying to find a balance that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise. You're getting a decent chunk of the money too! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $550,000 in round 3 is now worth 85.74% of what it was in round 1, which is $472,550.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'm not thrilled with the idea of taking $300,000, which is worth 30% of what my initial gain was worth in round 1. I'd like to try to negotiate further to get a better share.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with such a low offer. I'd like to try to get a better deal.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 5, the money is worth 5% less than in round 4, so my gain of $300,000 is now worth 95% of what it was in round 4, which is $285,000.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
 ""message"": ""I'm willing to split the money 50/50. This way, we both get an equal share and can call it a day.""
}
```

This offer is a bit more aggressive than my previous ones, but I'm trying to find a fair and equal split."
