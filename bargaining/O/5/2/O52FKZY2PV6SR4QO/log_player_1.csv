"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to see if Bob accepts and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, you can't do better than that! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation affecting the value of the money, I need to think carefully.

Since the money is worth less in each round, I'd rather get a larger share now and end the game. Bob's offer of 40$ is a good deal for me, considering the decreasing value of money.
