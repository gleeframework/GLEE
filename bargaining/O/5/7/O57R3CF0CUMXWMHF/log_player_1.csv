"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, seems fair to me!""
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the original 100$, which is 60 dollars, and Bob gets 40% of the original 100$, which is 40 dollars."
