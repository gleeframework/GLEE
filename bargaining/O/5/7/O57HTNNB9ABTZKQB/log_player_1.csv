"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping he'll accept quickly and we can end the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take it, Alice! It's a fair deal! 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth 20% less for Bob, his offer is actually more generous than it seems. I'll accept his offer.
