"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
``` 

I propose a 55/45 split in my favor.  I think this is a fair starting point, considering I get the first offer and the money will start to lose value quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is worse than my original offer, even after accounting for inflation.  I will reject and make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
``` 

I'm proposing an even split of $50 each. Since Bob's offer was worse than my initial one, I believe this is a fair compromise, especially with the inflation factor starting to take effect."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my previous offer, even taking inflation into account. I will reject and make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}
```

I'm proposing a 45/55 split in favor of Bob.  I believe this is a fair offer considering the rapid inflation, and I want to reach an agreement before the money becomes practically worthless."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly unreasonable. Even with inflation, it's significantly worse than my previous offer. I will reject and continue negotiating."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60}
```

I'm proposing a 40/60 split in favor of Bob.  I'm willing to give a bit more to avoid further rounds of negotiation and avoid losing more value due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still far too unfavorable, even considering the significant inflation. I'm determined to get a fairer share and will continue negotiating."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 35, ""bob_gain"": 65}
```

I'm proposing a 35/65 split in favor of Bob.  We're running out of time, and I need to concede a bit more to reach an agreement before we both lose everything."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 36.98% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is becoming increasingly unreasonable.  While inflation is a factor, it's not enough to justify such a lopsided split. I'm willing to negotiate further to secure a more equitable outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 30, ""bob_gain"": 70}
```

We are nearing the end of the game.  I am proposing a 30/70 split in favor of Bob.  I recognize the value of the money is dwindling rapidly, and I need to concede further to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 68.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 43.12% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even with the significant inflation, accepting Bob's offer would be a complete loss for me. I refuse to accept such an unfair deal and will stand my ground, even if it means we both get nothing."
