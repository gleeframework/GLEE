Let's see if Bob agrees to this fair, but slightly advantageous, offer!"

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see if we can get a better deal in the next round!"

This offer still gives me a significant portion of the money, while also acknowledging that we need to come to an agreement quickly to avoid further inflation losses."
