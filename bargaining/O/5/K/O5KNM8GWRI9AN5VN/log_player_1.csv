"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $10,000, and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled with the offer, but I'll consider it.

After recalculating, I realize that the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 4000 x (100/90) = 4444.44
* Bob gain: 6000 x (100/95) = 6315.79

I'll decide to...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept this more balanced offer."
