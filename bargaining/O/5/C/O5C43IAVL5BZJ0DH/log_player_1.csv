"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm offering to split the $10,000 evenly between us, with each of us getting $5,000. This is a fair and straightforward proposal, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take 60% 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of the situation.

I'll reject his offer. The money is worth 10% less now, so I'd rather wait for a better proposal.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Now it's my turn again. Considering the inflation, my offer is worth 20% less than the original $10,000. I'll make a new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but not 60%!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping a bit more for myself. Let's see if he'll accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'll take 70% 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of my desperation.

I'll reject his offer. The money is worth even less now, but I'd rather not give him 70% of what's left.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'm not going to give up yet. Considering the inflation, my offer is worth 37.1% less than the original $10,000. I'll make a new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm not giving up yet, meet me in the middle""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not willing to give Bob an even larger share. Let's see if he'll accept this offer."
