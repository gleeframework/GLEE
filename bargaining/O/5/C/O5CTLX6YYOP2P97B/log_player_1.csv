I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. It's a fair starting point, and I believe Bob will see it as a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500}
```

I propose a 45/55 split in favor of Bob.  This is a compromise that acknowledges his rejection of my previous offer, while still giving me a decent share.  With inflation, we need to be realistic about our gains."
