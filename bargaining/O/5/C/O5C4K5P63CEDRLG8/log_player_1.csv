"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```
I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets the remaining 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I still get the same value from my share, but Bob's share is worth 10% less.

I'll accept this offer.
