"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. 60/40 seems reasonable. What do you think?""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Starting Point:**  A 60/40 split in Alice's favor is a strong opening offer. It gives Alice a clear advantage but isn't so extreme that Bob would immediately reject it.
* **Time Pressure:** Both players lose money to inflation each round. Bob's losses (20% per round) are much steeper than Alice's (10%). This time pressure encourages Bob to consider even somewhat unfavorable offers as the game progresses. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:** The message is framed as a starting point for negotiation, leaving room for Bob to counter-offer and find a mutually agreeable split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a good starting point, Alice.  How about we meet closer to the middle? This accounts for the inflation affecting us both. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to a 50/50 split and acknowledges the inflation factor, it's not advantageous enough for Alice to accept just yet. Here's why:

* **Inflation Favors Alice:** Bob's higher inflation rate means he loses value faster with each passing round.  Alice can leverage this.
* **Early Rounds:** It's still early in the game. Rejecting now puts pressure on Bob to make a more compelling offer in the next round.
* **Target Range:** Alice should aim for a split closer to her original 60/40 proposition, especially considering she has the inflation advantage."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5800,
""bob_gain"": 4200,
""message"": ""I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, Bob, but the inflation hits you harder than me. Let's settle this quickly. 58/42 seems fair considering the circumstances.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Concession:** Alice reduces her demand slightly from 60/40 to 58/42, demonstrating flexibility.
* **Emphasis on Inflation:** The message reiterates that Bob's losses due to inflation are greater, justifying Alice's stronger position.
* **Urgency:**  ""Let's settle this quickly"" adds a sense of urgency, reminding Bob that time is of the essence. 

By Round 3, Bob should be feeling the pressure of potential losses and might be more inclined to accept a deal that's still reasonably favorable to Alice."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is ticking, Alice. I'm willing to be flexible, but this offer is as low as I can go. Let's wrap this up. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Shifting Power Dynamics:** While not ideal, Bob's offer is now reasonably close to Alice's previous proposal. The longer the game goes on, the more the inflation difference starts to benefit Alice less and less in practical terms as the total amount shrinks.
* **Bob's Firm Stance:**  ""This offer is as low as I can go"" signals that Bob is unlikely to budge much further. Holding out for a marginally better deal might backfire.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Accepting a 55/45 split at this stage is better than risking getting a worse deal or even reaching no deal at all, leading to zero gain for both players.  

It's time for Alice to prioritize securing a win rather than holding out for an increasingly less likely ideal outcome."
