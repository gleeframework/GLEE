Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, Bob, but the inflation hits you harder than me. Let's settle this quickly. 58/42 seems fair considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the deal is getting worse for me due to the higher inflation rate, Alice is getting increasingly incentivized to settle quickly. Holding out longer puts more pressure on her to offer a better deal before we both lose out."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""Time is ticking, Alice. I'm willing to be flexible, but this offer is as low as I can go. Let's wrap this up.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my offer slightly to signal a willingness to compromise but also setting a firm boundary.  The message emphasizes the time pressure and aims to nudge Alice towards accepting a deal that, while not ideal, still gives me a reasonable share."
