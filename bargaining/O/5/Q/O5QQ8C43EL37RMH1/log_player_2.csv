Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

``` 
It's a tough decision, but with each round my gains keep getting smaller due to inflation.  It's better to take the $30 now than risk getting nothing at all in the next round."
