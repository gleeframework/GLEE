"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly considering inflation""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, considering that each round reduces the value of money by 20% for Bob, but not for me. This way, Bob still gets a significant amount, but I account for the future loss in value if we proceed to further rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair, considering the inflation that will affect me in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting this offer because, given the inflation dynamics, accepting a 40-60 split in Bob's favor doesn't account for the fact that the money's value remains constant for me but decreases for Bob with each round. I should leverage this advantage in negotiations."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""Considering the increasing impact of inflation on your gains, this split is more reasonable""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I've increased my share to 65%, considering the inflation's growing impact on Bob's potential gains. The money's value remains unchanged for me, but Bob faces a 20% decrease in value with each round. Given this dynamic, I believe a 65-35 split is more reasonable and reflects the changing value of the money over time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better share than 35 to make this worthwhile for me. Let's split it 45/55. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting this offer because, despite Bob's willingness to compromise, the 55-45 split still doesn't fully account for the significant decrease in value that Bob's share has undergone due to inflation. By this round, Bob's potential gains are worth 48.8% less than initially, while my potential gains remain unaffected. I should continue to negotiate for a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Given the substantial impact of inflation on your share, this is a more realistic split""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, considering the inflation's significant and growing impact on Bob's share, I've adjusted my offer to a 70-30 split in my favor. The money's value for Bob has decreased by nearly half since the first round, while it remains unchanged for me. This offer reflects the current state of the money's value for both of us, making it a more realistic proposal under these conditions."
