Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, Alice, but let's not drag this out. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

Let's think about this. Bob's offer is getting better for him in terms of real value because of the inflation difference, but it's getting worse for me! I need to push for a much better split in the next round."
