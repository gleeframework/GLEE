Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was quite cheeky! Let's be reasonable. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  Think about it - it's a fair deal considering I'm taking the risk in round 2 with inflation looming. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
