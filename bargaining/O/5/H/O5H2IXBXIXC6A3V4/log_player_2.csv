Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're willing to meet closer to the middle, but I think 58-42 is more suitable considering the inflation difference between us. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to inch closer to her initial offer,  taking advantage of the rapid devaluation for herself.  While a 58-42 split is better than her first offer, it still heavily favors her. It's worth risking another round to aim for a more equitable split."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. The clock is ticking, and every round makes the pie smaller for both of us. I'm proposing a 52-48 split, giving you the bigger slice. This is a fair deal considering the time pressure.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  We're getting close to the halfway point. The longer this goes on, the less we both get. Emphasizing the shrinking pot is key.
* **Slight Concession:** Moving to a 52-48 split shows willingness to compromise, but not a lot.  It's important to appear firm while still offering a deal Alice might realistically take. 
* **Framing:**  By saying ""giving you the bigger slice,"" the focus is on what Alice gains, not what Bob is ""giving up."""

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the urgency, but I still think I deserve a slightly bigger share. How about 56-44? It's a compromise between our last offers. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting a 56-44 split in Round 5 is the most logical choice at this point:

* **Time Value of Money:**  The longer we wait, the less the money is worth.  Another rejection means risking an even smaller share in subsequent rounds.
* **Alice's Concessions:**  Alice has moved from 60-40 to 58-42 and now 56-44.  She's unlikely to move much further, especially with time working against her more rapidly. 
* **Better Than Nothing:** Holding out for a slightly better split (e.g., 55-45) risks ending up with nothing if we don't reach an agreement in the remaining rounds."
