,,,Bob,1,reject
5500.0,4500.0,Your 60-40 split seems a bit unbalanced to me. How about we meet closer to the middle with a 55-45 split in your favor? This accounts for the time-value of money with the deal tilting slightly more in your favor as rounds progress.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5800.0,4200.0,"I see you're willing to meet closer to the middle, but I think 58-42 is more suitable considering the inflation difference between us.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
5200.0,4800.0,"Alice, let's be realistic. The clock is ticking, and every round makes the pie smaller for both of us. I'm proposing a 52-48 split, giving you the bigger slice. This is a fair deal considering the time pressure.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5600.0,4400.0,"I understand the urgency, but I still think I deserve a slightly bigger share. How about 56-44? It's a compromise between our last offers.",Alice,5,
