"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000
}
```

I'm offering to take 90% of the $10,000 and give Bob $1,000. This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it quickly so we can avoid the effects of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is losing value, so I'll have to be more careful. Since Bob's offer is now worth 10% less than the original amount, I'll need to consider the reduced value.

In this case, I'll accept the offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take $6,000 and Bob will take $4,000."
