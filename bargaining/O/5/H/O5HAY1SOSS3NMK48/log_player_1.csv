"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. The message is a friendly one, hoping to set a positive tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous in round 1, now it's my turn to be greedy! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I expected as much!

Given the inflation, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly, and I need to be more cautious. Bob's offer is quite aggressive, but I'll have to consider it carefully.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now. My next move will be more aggressive.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation taking a toll, I'll have to be more aggressive to get a better deal. Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Time to take a bigger share, Bob!""
}
```

I'm now offering Bob a smaller share, but I'm hoping that the pressure of the time constraint and the inflation will make him more willing to accept a smaller amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting greedy, Alice! Time to take a bigger bite! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a big bite out of my potential gains. I need to think carefully about this offer.

With the value of the money decreasing rapidly, I'm not sure if I should take this offer or wait for a better one. However, the fact that Bob is offering a higher share to himself this time around makes me think that he might be getting desperate.

I'll reject this offer, hoping that Bob will get more aggressive and offer me an even better deal.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation taking a significant toll, I'll have to be even more aggressive in my next offer. Here's my revised proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Last chance, Bob! Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share, but I'm hoping that the pressure of the time constraint and the inflation will make him accept this deal. I'm essentially saying that this is my final offer, and he needs to take it if he wants to get anything."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're running out of chances, Alice! I'm taking control now! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll now! The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, and I'm getting desperate.

However, Bob's offer is actually a slight improvement from his previous one, and I'm starting to feel like I'm running out of options. I'll have to accept this offer, hoping that I can at least salvage something from the situation.
