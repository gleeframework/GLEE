"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's offer was 75% of the original amount, I'll try to counter with a similar proposal. However, I'll take a slightly larger share to compensate for the decreasing value of the money over time.

{""bob_gain"": 80, ""alice_gain"": 20}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 38.75 
# Alice gain: 61.25 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the decreasing value of the money, Alice's offer seems reasonable. I'll accept this offer to avoid further negotiations.
