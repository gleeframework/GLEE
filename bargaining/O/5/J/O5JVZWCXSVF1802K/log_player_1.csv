"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a very lopsided offer.  I figure, even with the inflation, Bob might be willing to take a small gain instead of risking getting nothing if we keep playing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It's a fair offer, and I don't want to risk losing money to inflation."
