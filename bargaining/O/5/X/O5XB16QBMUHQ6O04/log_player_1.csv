Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but it wasn't quite fair. Let's be more realistic. I propose 70/30.  We both lose if this drags on. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70
