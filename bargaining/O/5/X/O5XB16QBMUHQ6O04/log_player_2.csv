"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 90/10 split. I think it's a fair start, and I'm confident we can come to a more equitable agreement in the next round if you're not satisfied. 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but it wasn't quite fair. Let's be more realistic. I propose 70/30.  We both lose if this drags on.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise further, but 70/30 is still too lopsided. Let's meet in the middle at 55/45. If we don't find common ground soon, we'll both end up with less. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice's offer is getting much closer to a reasonable split.  It's still in her favor, but waiting any longer will likely result in a worse outcome for me as her gains continue to depreciate."
