Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a pretty aggressive start, taking the lion's share of the money.  I'm betting that Bob will be tempted to accept this offer in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly less than what I was aiming for in the first round, and even though I have to factor in inflation, it's still not a good deal for me. I'm going to reject and try to get a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to lower my initial offer a little, but still keep a good chunk of the money. Since I'm the one making the offer this round, I want to try and get something closer to what I want. I think this offer is still fair, considering Bob's previous offer, and it's enough to avoid any potential penalties from inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough one. While Bob's offer is less than what I was aiming for, the inflation rate is really starting to hit, and it's likely to get worse. Taking this offer now would be a lot better than risking it and potentially getting nothing in the end."
