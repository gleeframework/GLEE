Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be reasonable. This offer ensures we both benefit significantly. It's a fair deal considering the declining value.""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to negotiate, but I need a better deal than that. Let's split the difference and make this a fair trade. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is negotiating, the rate of inflation is hurting me more than her. Holding out for a slightly better offer in the next round or two is still the best strategy."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Alice, time is running out and the value is decreasing rapidly. This offer is a good compromise for both of us. Let's settle this now and avoid further losses.""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're both losing money here. I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bigger share to make it worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

The rate of inflation is becoming critical. While this isn't the ideal deal, accepting ensures I get something substantial. Waiting longer risks getting even less, and potentially nothing if we don't reach an agreement in time."
