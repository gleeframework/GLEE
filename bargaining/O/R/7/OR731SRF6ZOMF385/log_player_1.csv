"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

This is my initial offer. I'm aiming for a large portion of the money, but still leaving a small share for Bob to potentially accept.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more, the inflation is already affecting my potential gains. This offer is fair and ensures that I still get a significant share. I'll accept."
