"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 525000,
""alice_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""My turn! Let's find a compromise. This considers the time value of money.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Value of Money:**  It's crucial to recognize that the value of the money decreases with each round. Alice is affected by this more severely (10% decrease) than Bob (5% decrease).
* **Strategic Advantage:** By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob signals he's not desperate and aims for a more favorable outcome. 
* **Compromise:** Offering Alice slightly less than half acknowledges the time pressure but still secures a larger portion for Bob, capitalizing on his slower depreciation rate.
* **Clear Communication:** The message directly addresses the reasoning behind the offer, making it more palatable for Alice and potentially leading to a quicker agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, let's meet in the middle 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Impact:**  The value of the money has significantly decreased for both players. Accepting a slightly less favorable split now is better than risking further losses due to inflation.
* **Alice's Position Weakening:** While Alice's offer is still slightly tilted in her favor, the decreasing value of the money hurts her more.  She's likely feeling the pressure to close a deal. 
* **Minimal Gains from Further Negotiation:**  Even if Bob could negotiate a slightly better deal in subsequent rounds, the inflation losses would likely outweigh those gains. 

It's time to secure a reasonable offer and end the game before the value deteriorates further."
