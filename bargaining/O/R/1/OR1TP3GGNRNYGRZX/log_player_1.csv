"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, seems fair""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor, which is a relatively generous offer considering the initial amount. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, reflecting the fact that the money is worth less to you than it is to me. Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to turn the tables on me!

I'll think for a moment...

Since the money is indeed worth less to me due to inflation, I'm willing to accept a more favorable split for Bob. However, I'm not willing to give up as much as he's proposing. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 45% and take 55% - that's the best I can do""
}
```

Your turn again, Bob!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less to me and 5% less to Bob, I'll make a new offer that takes this into account. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I still need to keep a decent share""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
