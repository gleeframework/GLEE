"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

I propose that I get $9,000 and Bob gets $1,000.  I'm hoping this is a good starting point that will give me a good chunk of the money, but still leaves Bob with something to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, accepting this offer means I still get a significant portion of the money, even after inflation.  It's better than risking getting nothing in the later rounds."
