"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose to keep 5500$ and give 4500$ to Bob.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I would have preferred to keep more, accepting this offer is the best choice. In the next round, my share would be worth 5% less, so I'm better off taking what I can get now."
