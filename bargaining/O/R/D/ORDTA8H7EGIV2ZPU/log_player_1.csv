I'm going to be greedy and try to get the most money possible for myself in the first round.  I'll offer Bob a small amount and see if he'll accept it.  After all, he doesn't know about the inflation yet.  Let's see what happens!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

While I'd prefer more, it's not worth risking getting nothing at all.  5000 is better than nothing, especially since the money is worth less each round."
