"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor, as I am the first to propose and want to secure a large share. However, I am aware that Bob may not accept this immediately. I believe this offer is fair considering the risks of the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred a larger share, I believe accepting this offer is the best strategy.  With each round, the potential value of the money decreases due to inflation, making it increasingly risky to reject offers.  A 60/40 split is a reasonable compromise, securing me a significant portion of the money."
