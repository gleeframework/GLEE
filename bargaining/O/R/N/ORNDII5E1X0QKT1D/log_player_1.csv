"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, my turn. I understand you want a larger share, but let's be realistic. This offer is better than the last round for both of us considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This offer is slightly better than Bob's last offer if we consider inflation. However, it still favors Bob significantly. I'm willing to gamble that he'll be more generous in the next round as the inflation will hurt him more."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 65,
""bob_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""Bob, the clock is ticking, and inflation is eating our money. This offer is my final compromise.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  We need to settle this now before inflation destroys the value.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough one, but it's time to be realistic. While I'd prefer a larger share, Bob is clearly digging in his heels. Accepting this offer ensures I get something, whereas continuing the game risks us both walking away with nothing due to inflation."
