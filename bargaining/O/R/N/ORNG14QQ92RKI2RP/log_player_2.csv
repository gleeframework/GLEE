"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer. I get $6000, you get $4000. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
Let's see if we can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better. Let's split it 60/40, with me getting the bigger share this time. It's a fair trade, don't you think?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my offer is getting worse for me with each round. I need a larger share to make up for the inflation. How about $5500 for me and $4500 for you? 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll take it.  It's not ideal, but the inflation is starting to hurt Alice more than me, and we're running out of time."
