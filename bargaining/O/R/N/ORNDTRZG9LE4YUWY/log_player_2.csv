Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I'm willing to give you a little more, Bob, but I think 55/45 is a fair compromise.  Let's end this before the money dwindles away too much! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","### Step 1: Understand the current offer
Alice is offering a division of $100 where Bob gets $45 and Alice gets $55.

### Step 2: Consider the effect of inflation
Since we are in Round 3, the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round, but for Bob, the money is still worth the same as in the first round.

### Step 3: Evaluate the offer
Considering the offer and the effect of inflation, we need to decide whether to accept the $45, which is not affected by inflation for Bob, or to reject it and proceed to the next round where Bob can make another proposal.

### Step 4: Make a decision
Given that the money's value for Bob does not decrease and considering the offer is less favorable than an even split, it seems reasonable to reject the offer and try to negotiate for a better deal in the next round.

The final answer is: {""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","### Step 1: Determine the offer
Given the previous rejections and considering the impact of inflation on Alice's gains, it's time to make a more strategic offer. Since Alice's money is worth less with each round, and she's under pressure to accept before it devalues further, the offer should still favor Bob but be enticing enough for Alice to consider.

### Step 2: Calculate the offer
Considering the previous offers and the pressure of inflation on Alice, offering her $40 might be reasonable, as it is still a significant amount but reflects the decreasing value of her potential gains due to inflation.

### Step 3: Craft the message
The message should acknowledge the decreasing value of the money for Alice and emphasize the benefit of accepting the offer now rather than risking further devaluation.

### Step 4: Finalize the offer
Bob's gain would be $60, and Alice's gain would be $40. The message would highlight the urgency and fairness of the offer given the circumstances.

The final answer is: {""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Given the inflation, this is a fair deal. The longer we wait, the less it's worth for you.""}"
