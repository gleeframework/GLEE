"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take 60 and you can have 40.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me a slightly larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 51/49 split is fairer, considering you'll get a slightly lower value in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 51-49 split, but I do think it's a reasonable offer considering the inflation factor.
