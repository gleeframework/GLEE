"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you a decent amount to get us started.""
}
```

I'm offering to give Bob 20% of the money, which is $2000, and keeping 80% for myself, which is $8000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this fair split and we can finish the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not giving away too much yet. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less in the second round, my gain of $6000 is actually worth 80% of the original amount, which is $4800 in real value. I'll have to consider that when making my decision.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now, as I'm hoping to get a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not convinced this is the best deal for me. I'll wait for a better offer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In the third round, the money is worth 40% of its original value due to inflation. I'll make an offer that takes this into account.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""bob_gain"": 6000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a larger share this round, but I'm still not giving away too much.""
}
```

In this offer, I'm giving Bob 60% of the remaining money, which is $6000, and keeping 40% for myself, which is $4000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm not sure if he'll take it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving up too much more. This is my last generous offer. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rate of 48.8%, my gain of $3000 is actually worth 51.2% of the original amount, which is $5120 in real value. Considering the offer, I think I should accept it. Bob is offering me a decent amount, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with a lower value.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, I'll take it. I'm not sure I'll get a better offer next round.""
}"
