"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start, we can reassess later""
}
```

This offer gives me $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. I'm starting with a relatively generous offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a more balanced split 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's new offer. Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: $5,000 x 0.9 = $4,500
* Bob gain: $5,000

I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me again, my offer will be:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""You're getting the better deal, take it or leave it""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly smaller share to give you a better deal 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts, taking into account the 27.1% reduction for me:

* Alice gain: $4,000 x 0.7279 (1 - 0.2721) = $2,911.60
* Bob gain: $6,000

I'll think for a moment...

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 27.1% less for me again, my offer will be:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3000,
  ""bob_gain"": 7000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting any more generous, so I'll take what I can get""
}
```"
