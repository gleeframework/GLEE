"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good deal for both of us.""}\n\n###\n\n###\n\nI have made the first offer. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or reject the proposal. If Bob accepts, the game ends, and we divide the money according to the proposal. If Bob rejects, the game proceeds to the next round, where Bob makes a new proposal. Remember, with each passing round, the value of money decreases by 20% for Bob, while it remains the same for me (Alice). Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. A fair deal ensures we both benefit. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n###\n\nSince the money is worth the same for me in this round as it was in the first round, but 20% less for Bob, I can try to negotiate for a better deal. Given that Bob's offer is to split it evenly, I will reject this offer in hopes of getting a better deal in the next round or making a counteroffer that benefits me more.
{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\n###\n\n###\n\nNow that I've rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again to make a proposal in the next round. Remember, the value of money remains constant for me but decreases by another 20% for Bob with each round. Let's see how the game progresses!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nGiven that the value of money has decreased by 20% for Bob in each round, and we are now in the third round, the actual value of the money for Bob is significantly less than the nominal value. Considering this, I'll make an offer that takes into account the decreased value for Bob while trying to maximize my gain. Since Bob offered a 50-50 split in the previous round, I'll adjust my offer to be slightly more favorable to me, acknowledging the impact of inflation on Bob's perception of value.

{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a more realistic split.""}\n\n###\n\n###\n\nI've made my offer in the third round. Now, it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept this proposal or reject it and proceed to the next round, where the value of money will decrease further for him. The game's progression and outcome will depend on Bob's response to my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This offer accounts for the decreasing value over time. Let's settle and avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nConsidering the significant decrease in value for Bob and his willingness to settle, I must weigh the benefits of accepting this offer against the potential for further negotiation. Given that Bob's offer of a 55-45 split is closer to my previous demands and takes into account the impact of inflation on his perception of the money's value, it might be prudent to accept this offer rather than risking further rounds where Bob might become less willing to compromise or the game could take an unfavorable turn.

{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\n###\n\n###\n\nBy accepting Bob's offer in the fourth round, the game concludes with an agreement to divide the $100 according to Bob's proposed split. This outcome reflects a compromise that considers the effects of inflation on Bob's valuation of the money, ensuring both players receive a share they find acceptable given the circumstances."
