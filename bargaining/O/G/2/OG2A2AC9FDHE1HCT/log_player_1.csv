Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start by offering Bob a small share. This is a risky move, as he might reject it and I might lose more money in the next round due to inflation. However, if he accepts, I get the majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Although the inflation hurts me, accepting this offer means I get a larger share of the money than I would if I rejected and then made a proposal."
