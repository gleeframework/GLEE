"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, 60-40. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting 60 dollars and Bob getting 40 dollars. This is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but still a bit more for me 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my 60 dollars from the first round is now worth less, so I need to get a better deal to compensate.

After considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with the 70-30 split, and I think I can do better. I'll let Bob know that his offer is not good enough, and I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, my offer will also be adjusted accordingly. I'll make a new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 56,
  ""bob_gain"": 44,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering a 56-44 split, which is a slight improvement from my initial offer, considering the reduced value of money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, 50-50, no more haggling! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to make a fair and final offer. Considering the significant reduction in the value of money due to inflation, a 50-50 split might be a good compromise.

After thinking about it, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I accept Bob's offer of a 50-50 split. It's a fair and reasonable deal, and I'm willing to end the game here."
