"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 100, ""bob_gain"": 0}

This is a bold move, but I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can avoid further negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making a decision.

Since the money is worth 5% less for Bob, I'm not sure if he's being generous or trying to take advantage of me. I'll reject this offer for now.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","In round 3, I'll make a new proposal that takes into account the fact that Bob's offer was rejected.

I'll offer a more balanced split, but still trying to maximize my gain. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}"
