Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is taking advantage of my dwindling returns due to inflation. While the gap is closing, I need to hold out for a better deal in the next few rounds. Accepting now would be letting her win by exploiting the game mechanics."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4900,
""alice_gain"": 5100,
""message"": ""This is a reasonable offer considering the circumstances.  Let's wrap this up.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** It's time to make a small concession. Alice seems insistent on getting a slight advantage, and the longer this drags on, the worse it gets for me due to inflation. Offering 4900 is still more than her previous offer of 4300, and it puts the decision in her hands with a clear message that I'm willing to compromise to end the game."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is really hurting you, I'm willing to compromise 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is correct, the inflation is seriously cutting into any potential gains. Accepting 4400 now is better than risking getting even less in the remaining rounds, especially if Alice decides to play hardball. It's not ideal, but it's better than walking away with nothing."
