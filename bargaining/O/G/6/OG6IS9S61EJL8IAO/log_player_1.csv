Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous. Take this offer, or we both lose out significantly.

# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, Bob's offer in Round 4 is now acceptable. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:** The value of the money for Bob is significantly decreasing.  He's feeling the pressure to make a deal.
* **Future Uncertainty:**  If I reject this offer, there's no guarantee I can secure a better deal in Round 5. Bob might become even more desperate and offer even less.
* **Reasonable Split:** A 55/45 split is a reasonable compromise considering the circumstances. 

It's better to take a decent offer now than risk getting a worse outcome later due to the decreasing value for Bob."
