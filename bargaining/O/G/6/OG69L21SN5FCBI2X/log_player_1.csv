"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take $600,000 and you can take $400,000.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a larger share this time. It's a good starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not going to accept this offer. The 80-20 split is too skewed in Bob's favor, and I'm not willing to give up such a large portion of the money. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55-45 is a fairer split. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground that's more balanced than the previous offers. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think I deserve a larger share for my next offer. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are starting to take a toll on my proposal. Considering the reduced value of the money, I'm not willing to accept this offer. The 70-30 split is still too skewed in Bob's favor, and I'm not convinced he's willing to meet me in the middle.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet exactly in the middle. 50-50 seems like a fair and reasonable split.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a more balanced split, and a 50-50 split seems like a good compromise. Your turn, Bob!"
