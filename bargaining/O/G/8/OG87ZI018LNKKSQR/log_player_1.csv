I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. I think this is a fair starting point, as it reflects the value I bring to this negotiation. ðŸ˜‰"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3

I propose a 50/50 split. Since Bob rejected my previous offer, I think it's time for a more equitable solution."
