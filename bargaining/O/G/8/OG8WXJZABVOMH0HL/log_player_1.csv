Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This is a very simple strategy. Since I (Alice) am not losing value from round to round, it makes sense to try and get as much as possible. I will likely need to compromise in later rounds, but I will see how Bob responds to this very imbalanced offer first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is significantly better than my initial proposal, I still believe I can get a better deal. Since I'm not losing value with each round, I can afford to be more patient and see if I can get closer to a 50/50 split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm increasing my offer to 600,000 for myself and 400,000 for Bob. This is a more balanced split, and I hope it will encourage Bob to accept. The inflation will be starting to affect him more in the next round, so I believe this is a good time to offer a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'm not thrilled with this offer, Bob's inflation is starting to bite, and his offers are getting worse.  I'm better off taking this deal than risking getting a worse offer in the next round."
