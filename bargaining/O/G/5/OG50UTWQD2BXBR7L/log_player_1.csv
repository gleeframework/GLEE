"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
I propose taking $9,000 and leaving $1,000 for Bob.  I figure this is a fair starting point given the inflation we need to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer more, I need to account for the inflation and it's likely Bob will continue to offer me less in the next round."
