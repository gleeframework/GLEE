Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 50-50 split. It's the fairest way to divide the money. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 55%, you take 45%. Considering the inflation, this is a reasonable adjustment. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
 
**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to a more agreeable split, it's still beneficial for me to hold out a little longer. The inflation is hurting me faster, but another round might make Bob more willing to accept a deal where I get a slightly larger share."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Okay Bob, let's settle this. I'll accept the same split you offered last round, but with me getting the slightly larger share.  Deal?""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  It's getting risky now.  While ideally, I'd want a bit more, accepting Bob's previous offer but flipped in my favor might be the best I can get. He's clearly aiming for a larger share, and the longer this goes on, the less attractive the overall pot becomes for both of us."
