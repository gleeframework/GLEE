"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a decent share!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, giving me $70 and leaving $30 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair. Let's move forward. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $45 is worth 95% of $45 from the previous round, so it's equivalent to $42.75.

I'm not thrilled about the 55-45 split, but I think it's a reasonable offer. I'll accept it.
