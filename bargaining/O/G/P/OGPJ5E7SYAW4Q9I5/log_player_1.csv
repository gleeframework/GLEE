"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

**My reasoning:**

Since I don't know how the inflation affects Bob, I'm going to be greedy and propose a 90/10 split in my favor. I figure Bob might accept this since it's a significant amount of money, but if not, I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**My reasoning:**

Even with the inflation, Bob's offer still represents a significant gain for me. While I would have preferred a larger share, accepting this offer is the best way to ensure I get something.  If I reject it, I risk getting even less in the next round, and the value of the money will continue to decline."
