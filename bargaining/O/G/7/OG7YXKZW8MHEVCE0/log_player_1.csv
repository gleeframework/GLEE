"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I'm starting with a generous offer, hoping to secure a quick agreement.  I'm taking 90% and leaving 10% for Bob. Let's see if he bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is a lot worse than my first offer, and the inflation is hurting me more than him. I'm going to reject and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to try to compromise a bit. I'm going to offer Bob 400,000, which is still a lot more than his previous offer, and take 600,000 for myself.  Hopefully, this will be enough to get him to accept, as the inflation is starting to bite."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm going to accept this offer. Even though it's a bit worse than my last offer, the inflation is really starting to hurt, and I'm not sure if I can get a better deal in the next round. This is a decent amount of money, and I'm not willing to risk losing more to inflation."
