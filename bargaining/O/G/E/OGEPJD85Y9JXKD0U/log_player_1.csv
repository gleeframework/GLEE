"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}

This offer gives me the majority of the money, but it still leaves Bob with a small portion.  I'm hoping this will be enough to get him to accept, as the value of the money will decrease with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more money, I'm taking this deal. The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, and if I reject, I risk getting nothing in the end."
