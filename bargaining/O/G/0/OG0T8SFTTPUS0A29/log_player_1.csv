Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a more fair split, considering the inflation affects you more than me. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Bob, time is literally money for me in this game.  I'm willing to accept a slightly smaller amount than my initial offer to get this done now.""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The longer we play, the more you lose. I think this split is more than fair considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is using a classic negotiation tactic by highlighting my loss aversion (the fact I lose money each round). However, accepting a deal where I get less than half is a bad strategy long term.  I need to show Bob I'm willing to walk away from the table, even if it means losing more to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  Let's be fair, split it down the middle and call it a day.  Any more rounds and we're both just losing money.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  By this point, it's important to make a final stand. Offering a 50/50 split shows Bob I'm serious about getting a reasonable deal, but I'm not going to be pushed any further. It emphasizes the mutual loss from continuing the game. If Bob rejects this, I'll likely need to accept a less favorable offer in the next round to avoid even bigger losses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: At this point, you're losing a significant amount to inflation. I think this is a generous offer, all things considered. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Unfortunately, Bob is right. While his offer is far from ideal, the relentless inflation means every round that passes significantly eats into my potential gains. Accepting a 30/70 split is painful, but holding out any longer risks even further losses. It's a bitter pill to swallow, but the best option in this situation."
