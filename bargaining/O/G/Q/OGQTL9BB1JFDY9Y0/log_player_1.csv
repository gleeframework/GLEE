"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to give Bob exactly half of the money, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject my offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but not too generous yet 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I can still get $500,000 in value, but Bob's gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, so he's gaining $540,000 in value.

My response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm still hoping to get more than half of the money. I'll wait for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more!""
}
```

I'm trying to get a slightly better deal than before, taking into account that Bob's offer was rejected and he might be willing to give me a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not willing to give up too much 
# Alice gain: 460000 
# Bob gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the values:

* My gain is still worth the same as in the first round, $500,000.
* Bob's gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, which is $730,000 (600,000 * 0.971).
* However, in this round, Bob's gain is worth $540,000, which is even less than my gain.

My response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer because it's a better deal than my previous offer, and I'm not sure if I'll get a better offer in the next round."
