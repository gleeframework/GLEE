"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and straightforward offer. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can do better than that, let's talk! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks I can do better, huh?

Considering the inflation, the $400,000 I'd get in this offer is actually worth 95% of $500,000, which is $475,000. That's a decent offer, but I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, the money is worth 90.25% of its original value now (95% of 95%). I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly higher share, but I'm not going to give you the majority.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I want more 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is eating away at my potential gain!

Considering the inflation, the $300,000 I'd get in this offer is actually worth 28.55% of the original $1,000,000 (95% of 90.25% of 95%). That's a pretty low offer, but I'm not sure if I can do better.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value now. The $1,000,000 is worth only 76.25% of its original value (95% of 90.25% of 95% of 95%). I'll make a new offer that takes into account this reduced value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 384000,
  ""bob_gain"": 616000,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I need to make sure I get a decent share.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting impatient, you're not making it easy for me 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really eating away at my potential gain now. The $200,000 I'd get in this offer is actually worth 20% of the original $1,000,000 (95% of 90.25% of 90.25% of 95%). That's a very low offer, and I'm not sure if I can do better.

However, I'm getting close to the last few rounds, and I don't want to risk ending up with nothing. I'll accept this offer, hoping that I can make up for it in the next round.
