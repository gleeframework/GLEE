6000.0,4000.0,I propose dividing the money with a 60/40 split in favor of Alice. This allows us to share the wealth while ensuring a fair distribution.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,I propose a 55/45 split in your favor. This is a fair compromise considering the inflation we both face. It ensures we both get a significant share of the money.,Bob,2,
