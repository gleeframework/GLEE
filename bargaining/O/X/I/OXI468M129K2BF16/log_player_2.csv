Let's see what Alice offers next!  I want to see if I can get a better deal, especially knowing about the inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}
``` 
I'm offering Alice a 4000/6000 split in my favor. With inflation, I figure this is a good deal for me, and I'm hoping Alice will accept it to avoid risking a worse offer in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the inflation hurts me, Alice's offer is better than what I proposed in the previous round.  It's better to take what I can get before she makes a worse offer next time!"
