"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```
I'm offering a 60-40 split, which seems fair and reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is trying to flip the script on me!

I'll think about it for a moment... Considering the inflation effect, I'm not sure if I want to accept an offer that's less favorable to me than my original proposal, especially since I don't know how the inflation affects Bob's perception of the money.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Bob's offer was a 60-40 split, I'll try to adjust my offer to be more favorable to me. I'll offer a 55-45 split, which is a bit more in my favor.

Here's my offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```
Your turn, Bob!"
