"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer.  I take a bit more considering the inflation rate impacts me more. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. While I understand Alice's reasoning about the higher inflation rate impacting her more, this offer feels a bit too one-sided in her favor. I'm hoping for a more equitable split, taking into account the inflation factor but not completely surrendering to it. Let's see what Alice proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""Let's try a more balanced split. I'm willing to take a bit less, but I think we should consider the inflation on both sides.  ""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a negotiation, and I'm willing to adjust slightly. This offer is a compromise, taking inflation into account for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While Alice's offer is slightly better than her previous one, I'm still not happy with the imbalance.  The inflation factor is important, but I believe a more equitable split is possible. I'm willing to continue negotiating."
