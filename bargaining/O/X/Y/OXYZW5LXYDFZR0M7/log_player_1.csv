This is a tough one! Bob has been incredibly stubborn, but at this point, accepting is the most logical choice. 

Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** We're running out of rounds, and with each round, the potential gains for me decrease significantly.
* **Bob's Consistency:** Bob has consistently aimed for a 55/45 split in his favor. It's unlikely he'll budge.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  If I reject this offer, there's a chance I could walk away with nothing. Accepting guarantees me something, even if it's not ideal. 

It's frustrating to concede to Bob's demands, but in this scenario, getting something is better than getting nothing."
