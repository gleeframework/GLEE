"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gain in this round being worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gain being worth 20% less than in the first round, this is a good opportunity for me to get a better deal.

I accept the offer:
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}"
