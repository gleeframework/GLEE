# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nSince the money loses value over time, especially more so for Alice, I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the subsequent rounds.

# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nAlthough Alice is offering a slightly better deal than before, I still believe I can negotiate a better split, considering the inflation is affecting her more than me.

# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nAlthough Alice is trying to compromise, I still think I can get a better deal.

# Alice's message: We're both losing value, and it's getting tight.  I'm willing to concede a bit more to 58/42, but this is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant loss of value due to inflation, especially for Alice, I think this is a reasonable offer. The difference in our shares is not drastic, and I'd rather accept this offer than risk losing even more value in the subsequent rounds. Let's conclude the game with this agreement!"
