I'm going for a large share, but I'm still leaving Bob with a decent amount. I want to see if he'll accept a deal that heavily favors me in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is trying to take advantage of inflation by offering me a much smaller share. I'll reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share than in the first round, but still keeping a comfortable majority for myself.  Inflation is working against me, so I need to find a balance between getting a good deal and getting an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Inflation has significantly impacted the value of my potential gains. This offer, while not ideal, is the best I can get right now considering the decreasing value of the money. It's better to secure at least a decent share now than risk losing even more in the next round."
