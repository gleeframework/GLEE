"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and simple way to divide the money. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the lead, but I'll still give you a fair share 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my share of $40 is now worth 95% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, as it's not a 50/50 split like I initially proposed. However, it's a slightly better offer than the 25/75 split I would get if I were to reject and we went to the next round.

I'll decide to...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
