"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself. This way, I get a significant amount while still leaving Bob with a substantial sum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less now, the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: $475,000
Bob gain: $475,000

I'm willing to accept this offer, as it's a 50-50 split. Let's finish the game!
