"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing to divide the $1,000,000 equally between us, with each of us receiving $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking a slight edge this round. Let's see if you think it's worth waiting. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the uneven split, but I'll think it over.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 420000, ""bob_gain"": 580000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I'm not going to give up too much""}

I'm adjusting the split to give Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping a decent chunk for myself. Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this offer."
