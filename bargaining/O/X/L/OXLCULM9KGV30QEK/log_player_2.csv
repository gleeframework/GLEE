# Alice gain: 520000

Alice's offer is getting better, but it's still skewed in her favor considering the rapid depreciation she faces. Let's see if we can push for a more equitable split in the next round."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: 50/50, we're running out of time 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

A 50/50 split is fair, and waiting any longer significantly risks getting nothing at all."
