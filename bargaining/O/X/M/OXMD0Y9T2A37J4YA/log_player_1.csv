"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll give you $100,000. It's a fair starting point.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle. It's a fair deal, and we can both walk away happy. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less after the first round, and the inflation effect is cumulative, the money is now worth 90% of its original value.

In the second round, I'll gain 90% of $900,000, which is $810,000.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
