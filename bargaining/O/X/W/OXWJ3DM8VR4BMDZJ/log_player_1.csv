"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In the first round, I'll make a generous offer to Bob. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

This way, Bob gets a decent share of the money, and I still get the majority. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or reject my offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","In the second round, Bob is trying to take a larger share of the money. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give up 70% of the money in the second round. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In the third round, I'll try to make a more balanced offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I'll get a smaller share of the money, but I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finally divide the money."
