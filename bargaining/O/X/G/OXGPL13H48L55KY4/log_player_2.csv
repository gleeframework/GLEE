{""bob_gain"": 7000,
""alice_gain"": 3000,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer was heavily skewed in your favor. Let's be realistic. This is a chance for you to secure a decent sum before inflation eats away at its value further.""}

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 50/50 this time. We're both taking a hit from inflation, so I think a fair split is the best way to ensure we both get something. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000
