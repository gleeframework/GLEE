"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. This way, we both get a significant amount of money, and we can still have some room for negotiation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, and Bob's offer is the same as his previous one, I'll reject this offer as well.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less now due to inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes this into account. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $460,000 and keeping $540,000 for myself."
