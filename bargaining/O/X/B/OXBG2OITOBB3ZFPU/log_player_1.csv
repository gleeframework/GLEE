"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 10% and take the rest.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 90% of the money and Bob will get 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 80% and take 20%, a decent compromise 
# Alice gain: 800000 
# Bob gain: 200000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, Bob's offer is a bit more attractive than before.

I accept the offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
