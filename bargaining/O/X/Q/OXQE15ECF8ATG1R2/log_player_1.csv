Even with inflation, this offer is getting worse for me.  I need to hold firm for a better split."

{""decision"": ""reject""}

This offer is getting significantly worse for me with each round. While Bob is acknowledging the inflation, he's not offering a deal that reflects the real value I'm losing. I need to hold strong and hope he becomes more reasonable."

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your frustration, but I've made concessions in my previous offers. Given the current state of the game, I believe this is a fair proposal. It's time for you to be realistic about the impact of inflation on your share. 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough decision, but I have to accept.  Bob is clearly taking advantage of the situation and is unlikely to offer anything better. If I reject this, the remaining rounds will likely see even more lopsided offers in his favor, and I risk getting nothing at all. It's not ideal, but taking the $2,500 is better than walking away empty-handed."
