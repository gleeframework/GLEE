"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}

I'm going to try to maximize my gains in the first round. While it's risky, if Bob accepts, we're done. If he doesn't, I'll adjust my strategy in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer to get more, the inflation is a serious factor.  Accepting this offer ensures I get at least something, and avoids the risk of getting nothing in later rounds."
