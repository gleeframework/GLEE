I'm going to propose a pretty standard split, keeping most of the money for myself.  Let's see if Bob takes it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While I'm losing money due to inflation, Bob's offer is still incredibly unfair. I'm going to take my chances and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm going to offer a slightly more even split, but still leaning heavily in my favor.  Inflation is hitting me hard, so I need to secure a decent chunk of the remaining money."
