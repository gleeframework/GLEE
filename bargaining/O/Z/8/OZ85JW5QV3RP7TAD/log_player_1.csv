I propose a division of $90 for me and $10 for Bob. I'm hoping this is a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

```

I'm lowering my share slightly to try and find a compromise. Let's see if this is more agreeable."
