"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 51, ""bob_gain"": 49}
``` 

I propose a 51/49 split in my favor. This is a fair starting point, considering the inflation that will affect my share in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
