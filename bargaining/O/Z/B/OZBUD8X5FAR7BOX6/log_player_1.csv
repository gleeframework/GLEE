"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can always negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70/30 split, giving me a larger share but still leaving Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly. This way, we both get a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, I need to consider that when evaluating the offer.

In this case, I would gain $50, but its value would be 90% of the original $50, which is $45.

I would like to reject this offer and proceed to the next round. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the 10% inflation, I need to adjust my proposal accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the risk of inflation.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, which is a slight increase in my share to account for the inflation."
