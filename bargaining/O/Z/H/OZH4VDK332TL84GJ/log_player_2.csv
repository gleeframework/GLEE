"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you 400k, and I'll take the rest. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
It's a good starting point, but I think I can get more. Let's see what Alice offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is a bit more fair.  Let's see if you agree.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. How about a 48-52 split? It's a fair deal, and we can move forward. 
# Bob gain: 520000 
# Alice gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd like to see a bigger share, the inflation is a real risk. I'll take the 520,000 and move on."
