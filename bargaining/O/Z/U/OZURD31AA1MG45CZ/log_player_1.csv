"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $600,000, and leave $400,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split in my favor is more fair, given the potential for inflation. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, I'll have to adjust my gain to account for the 5% inflation. If I were to accept Bob's offer, I'd be getting $400,000, which is worth 95% of the initial $400,000, so it's actually $380,000.

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll have to adjust my gain to account for the 5% inflation again. Since the initial amount is still $1,000,000, my gain will be worth 0.95^2 = 0.9025 of the initial amount. So, if I were to offer 60% of the initial amount, I'd be offering $902,500.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55/45 is a fairer split. What do you think?""
}
```"
