"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

It's too early to accept a 60/40 split. There's a lot of potential to gain more, especially considering the inflation effect."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split in my favor is more fair, given the potential for inflation. What do you say?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55/45 is a fairer split. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
The inflation effect is starting to take a toll, and a 55/45 split is a good compromise. I don't want to risk going to the next round and potentially getting a worse offer."
