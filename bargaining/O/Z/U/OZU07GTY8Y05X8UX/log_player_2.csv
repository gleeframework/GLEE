Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but 90/10 is too much. Let's split the difference and go with 55/45 in your favor. This way we can both get a decent share, and we still have room to negotiate if we want to adjust it further down the line. 
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000
