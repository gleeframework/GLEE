"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly, I'm willing to compromise.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $10,000, which is $4,000, and I'll take the remaining $6,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, no need to be greedy! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to adjust my expectations.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take $5,000 and Bob will take $5,000. It's a fair compromise, and I'm willing to end the game here."
