Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be realistic. I'm feeling generous, but this deal gets worse for me every round.  Take it while it's good! 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000
