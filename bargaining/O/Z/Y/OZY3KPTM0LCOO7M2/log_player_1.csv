"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game on a high note!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 5% less for Bob, I'm not sure if I should accept a smaller share for myself. However, it's still a significant amount, and I don't want to risk going into further rounds and losing even more value due to inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer, and we can finalize the division of the money."
