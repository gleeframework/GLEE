"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 40, and I'll take 60. It's a good starting point.""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which is a fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's only fair that we each get half of the money. I'm happy to take 60 this round, and we can go from there. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth 20% less, so the actual amounts are:

* My gain: 40 * 0.8 = 32
* Bob's gain: 60 * 0.8 = 48

I'm not thrilled about the 48, but I think it's a reasonable offer considering the inflation. I'll accept the offer.
