"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 75-25 split in my favor, given that we're now in round two and the value of the money is decreasing. Let's reach a fair agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
