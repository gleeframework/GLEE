"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly, considering the inflation loss.""}\n\nHow's that? I made an offer that gives me $5500 and Bob $4500, with a message encouraging him to accept and avoid further inflation losses. Let me know what Bob decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, it's the fairest way to start. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer. Since the money is worth less in this round due to inflation, and considering Bob's higher inflation rate, I think I can get a better deal in the next round or make a counteroffer that takes the inflation into account. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, this is a more realistic split.""}\n\nI've made an offer that takes into account the decreased value of the money due to inflation. I'm willing to give Bob a bit less than before, but still a significant amount, in the hopes that he'll accept and we can conclude the game. Let's see what Bob decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give up a bit more to avoid further inflation losses. Let's find a compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer. Although Bob is willing to give up a bit more, the amount he's offering me is still lower than what I think I can get, considering the inflation rates. Since Bob's inflation rate is higher, I believe he'll be more eager to settle as the rounds progress. I'll try to make a counteroffer that takes advantage of this dynamic. Let's move to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Inflation is hitting you harder, let's settle on this.""}\n\nI've made an offer that takes into account the increasing difference in our inflation rates. Since Bob is losing more value with each round, I'm hoping he'll be more willing to accept a less favorable split to avoid further losses. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we're both losing too much to inflation. Let's split it evenly again and end this. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. Although the money is worth significantly less than in the initial round, the gap between our inflation rates is substantial. Bob is losing nearly twice as much value as I am, and his offer to split it evenly again is a good compromise, considering the circumstances. I'll take the $5000 and end the game before the inflation losses worsen."
