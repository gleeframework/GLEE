"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is quite generous, but I'm not sure if I want to give up 30% of the pie. I think I can do better.

I'll reject this offer and see if I can get an even better deal!"

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve more. Can you meet me at 75-25?""

# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000
