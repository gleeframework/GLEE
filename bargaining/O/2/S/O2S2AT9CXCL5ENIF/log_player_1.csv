"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split in my favor, which seems like a good starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 50$ is actually worth 40$ in the previous round's money. This is a fair split, so I'll accept the offer.
