"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. We can always negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's go for a 50/50 split. It's the most fair and avoids any potential arguments. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","A 50/50 split is a fair proposal, but I'm not sure if it's the best option for me. Considering the inflation, my gain of $500,000 is worth less than my original offer of $600,000. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll adjust my offer to account for the decreasing value of money. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share due to my initial proposal.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $450,000 and keeping $550,000 for myself, trying to get a slightly better deal."
