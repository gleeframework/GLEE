"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think it's fair to start with a generous offer. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Alice's initial offer is too skewed in her favor, and I believe we can find a more balanced division. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that's more balanced. Since the money is worth 10% less for me in each round, I'll try to find a mutually beneficial division.\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground. This offer is more balanced, considering the inflation.""}"
