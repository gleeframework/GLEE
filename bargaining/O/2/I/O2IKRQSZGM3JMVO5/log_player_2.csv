Alice's offer:

Round 2

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still believe I deserve a larger share. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to a more reasonable split, time is working in Bob's favor.  The value of Alice's share is dropping significantly faster than Bob's with each round. Bob needs to apply more pressure while remaining open to negotiation."

Round 4

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're both losing money with each round. It's time to be practical and split the money evenly. Let's end this game and move on. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, a 50/50 split is a reasonable outcome at this stage.  

* **Time Pressure:** With only 7 rounds remaining, the risk of walking away with nothing increases significantly.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Alice's share continues to lose value at a much faster rate than Bob's. While Bob might be able to secure a slightly larger share by continuing to negotiate, the potential gains are outweighed by the increasing risk of a stalemate. 

It's time for Bob to accept the offer and secure a fair portion of the money."
