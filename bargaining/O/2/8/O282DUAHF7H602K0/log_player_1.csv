"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the money and Bob gets 20%. This is a relatively generous offer, considering the inflation factor that favors Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation factor in mind, I'll re-evaluate Bob's offer.

Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob, the effective amounts are:

* My gain: 50 * 0.9 = 45
* Bob's gain: 50 * 0.95 = 47.5

I'm not thrilled about getting less than I initially proposed, but meeting in the middle seems like a reasonable compromise. I'll accept Bob's offer.
