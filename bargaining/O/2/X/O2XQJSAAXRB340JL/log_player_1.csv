"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can adjust in future rounds if needed.""}

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40. This is a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Let me know if Bob accepts or if he wants to proceed to the next round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair start, but I think I can do better. Your turn to adjust! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Thank you for the update.

I'll analyze Bob's offer:

* I'll gain $50, which is worth 20% less than the original $60 I proposed.
* Bob will gain $50, which is worth 10% less than the original $40 he would have gotten.

Considering the inflation effect, Bob's offer is actually a bit more favorable to me than my original proposal. I'll accept this offer for now.
