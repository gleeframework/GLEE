"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'll offer Bob $100,000 and keep $900,000 for myself. This gives me the majority of the money while still giving Bob a significant amount.  Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would have preferred a better deal for myself, the inflation is hitting hard.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures I get at least something, and the 20% loss to him might make him more inclined to accept my offer in the future if we keep playing."
