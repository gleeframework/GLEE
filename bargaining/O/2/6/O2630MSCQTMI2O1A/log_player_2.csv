"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I take the lion's share, but you get a decent starting point. Accept and we both win. 
# Bob gain: 50000 
# Alice gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
This is a risky game.  While a $50,000 starting point isn't bad, there's no guarantee Alice will be as generous in future rounds.  It's better to see what Alice is willing to offer in a later round, where the money might be worth more to her."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 900000,
""alice_gain"": 100000,
""message"": ""Let's be practical. I'm taking the majority, but I'm still giving you a fair share. Accept this and we can both avoid further negotiation.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I won't be taken advantage of.  Let's split this fairly, or we'll both end up with less. 
# Bob gain: 600000 
# Alice gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This offer is much better than the previous round.  While I'm getting less than my initial proposal, Alice's gains have been reduced by inflation, making this a more balanced deal. It's in my best interest to accept and end the game."
