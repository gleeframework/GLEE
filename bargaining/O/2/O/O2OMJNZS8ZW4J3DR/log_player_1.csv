"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and be done with it!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and straightforward offer. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the higher amount, but I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share than 50/50. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, and I need to think strategically. Since Bob is willing to give me a smaller share, I'll consider it. However, I'd like to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to counteroffer. Can you meet me at 55/45 in my favor?""
}
```

I'm not accepting Bob's offer, and I'm proposing a counteroffer that still favors me slightly."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 40% less than in the first round, I need to be more aggressive in my proposal. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I need to be the majority owner. Meet me at 55.5/44.5 and we can end this.""
}
```

I'm trying to take a bit more control of the division, but still leaving Bob with a decent share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting greedy, I'll give you a smaller share, but I'm not giving up control. Meet me at 70/30 and we can call it a day. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth even less, I need to be more careful with my decisions. Bob's offer is a significant reduction from my previous counteroffer, and I'm not sure if I should accept it.

However, considering the inflation and the fact that Bob is offering a clear 70/30 split, I think it's a good opportunity to take what I can get. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, 70/30 it is. Let's end this and get what we can.""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer, and we can finally divide the money."
