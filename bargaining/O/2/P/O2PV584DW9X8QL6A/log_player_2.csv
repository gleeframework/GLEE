# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'll reject this offer, as I think I can get a better deal in the next round.

# Alice gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nI'll accept this offer. Considering the decreasing value of the money for Alice, I think 60/40 is a reasonable split.
