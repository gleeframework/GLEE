"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair share, let's start with a good compromise""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets 40%, which is $40. I think this is a fair starting point for our negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, let's see if you agree 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think 40% is a good deal for me, considering the initial offer was 60% and now the money is worth less due to inflation. I'm willing to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more""}

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the initial $100, which is $55, and Bob gets 45%, which is $45. I'm trying to find a middle ground that's closer to my initial offer, but still takes into account the effects of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think this is the max I can offer 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not satisfied with this offer, as it's still not as good as my initial offer, and I've had to adjust to the effects of inflation. I'm willing to negotiate further to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, I'm willing to compromise""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair compromise considering the effects of inflation. I'm willing to meet Bob halfway and split the money evenly."
