I'm offering a 95/5 split in my favor.  Alice, it's time to start negotiating fairly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 15 
# Alice gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still not happy with this split.  While the inflation is making things worse, I'm confident I can get a better deal.  Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4

I'm still aiming for a larger share, but I'm willing to compromise a bit.  Let's see if Alice will accept this 80/20 split."
