Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's only fair that we split the money 60/40, with me getting the larger share since I rejected your offer. Let's be practical about this,  this is a better deal for both of us than getting nothing. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
