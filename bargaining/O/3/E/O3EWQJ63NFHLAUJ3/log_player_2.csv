"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. Take 1000 and let's end this quickly. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
 
It's too early to accept such a small share.  Let's see what Alice offers next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split this 60/40. A fair deal to start with, and we can both get more with a little less risk.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Let's split it 60/40, with me taking the larger share this time.  It's a good deal for both of us considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
 
While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is starting to bite. Accepting this offer guarantees me a decent amount and avoids further potential losses."
