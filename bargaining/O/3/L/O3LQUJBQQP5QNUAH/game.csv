60.0,40.0,"Let's make a deal! I take $60, you take $40.  It's important to settle this early before inflation eats away at our potential gains.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"I think we can do better than your initial offer. Considering the inflation, I believe this is a fair split.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"Bob, my friend, let's be reasonable.  Inflation is hurting both of us, even if it's hitting me harder. My last offer was already generous, but I'm willing to compromise to end this quickly. Let's split it $55 for me, $45 for you. Deal?",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
43.0,57.0,"I see you're feeling the pressure of inflation, but I'm not convinced yet. I'll give you a bit less than before, considering the circumstances. Take it before the money loses more value!",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
52.0,48.0,"Bob, the clock is ticking, and every round costs us money.  I'm compromising again, offering you $48. Let's close this deal and walk away with something substantial.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
40.0,60.0,"I see you're getting anxious, but I'm in no rush. The inflation isn't affecting me, so I'll take a bit more. You should consider accepting before the money loses even more value for you.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
50.0,50.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm proposing a simple, fair 50/50 split.  Let's end this before we both lose even more to this ridiculous inflation.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
38.0,62.0,"A 50/50 split? You should have thought of that earlier. The inflation is really hurting you now, and I'm not feeling generous. This is my new offer, take it or leave it.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
48.0,52.0,"Bob, this is absurd! I'm giving you the majority now. Take this offer before we both get nothing!",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
35.0,65.0,"You're getting desperate, and I'm not backing down. The inflation is crippling your gains, and I'm taking advantage of it. This is my new offer, and I won't go any lower.",Bob,10,
