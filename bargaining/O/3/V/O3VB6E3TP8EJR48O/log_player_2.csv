"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair split, considering I'm the one making the first offer.  Let's get this started! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible deal! While it's important to get a fair outcome, I'm not going to accept such a low offer in the first round.  There's plenty of time to negotiate."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor.  Time is money, and it's losing value fast.  Let's close this deal.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better deal than that.  Let's split it 60/40, recognizing that time is ticking for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is coming closer to a reasonable split, but it's still not in my best interest.  I need to hold out for a better deal.  The inflation is hurting me more than her, but there are still several rounds left for her to get more desperate."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a more balanced split.  I'm proposing 65/35. This factors in the time pressure and gives us both a good deal. Let's wrap this up."" 
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's call it even.  We both lose more with each passing round, so a 50/50 split makes the most sense for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

A 50/50 split is fair, and while I could push for more, the impact of inflation is becoming too significant to ignore. Accepting now guarantees me a reasonable share, whereas continuing to bargain risks a much smaller gain if we don't reach an agreement in time."
