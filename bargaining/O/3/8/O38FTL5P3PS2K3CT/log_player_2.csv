"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Even though the offer is ""fair"", Bob can do much better by rejecting and proposing in the next round. He knows that the money will be worth less for him with every passing round, but he can still potentially get a better deal by making a counter-offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is more fair, given that the money is worth less for me with each round.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'll offer a bit more 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

Bob should still reject. He knows that the money will be worth even less in the next round, so he can likely get a better deal by proposing again."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better deal than 42/58 to make this worthwhile for me. Let's split it 65/35.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll meet you halfway, but I won't go below 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

While the offer is slightly better than before, Bob should still reject. He knows he has time and Alice is willing to negotiate. In the next round, Bob can potentially get a better deal by proposing."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split the money evenly. Inflation is hurting me, but I'd rather have something than nothing.  Let's end this negotiation and move on.""}
```"
