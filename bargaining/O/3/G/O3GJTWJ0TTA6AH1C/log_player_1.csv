"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. You can try to negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 90% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob gets 10%. This is a generous starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, Alice. I'll give you a slightly better deal. 
# Alice gain: 800000 
# Bob gain: 200000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, the new amounts are:

Alice gain: 800000 * 0.8 = 640000
Bob gain: 200000 * 0.8 = 160000

I'm not too happy about the 20% decrease in value, but I'll consider Bob's offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not bad, but I'm still not getting enough. I'll try to negotiate further.""
