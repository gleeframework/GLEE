"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

Let's see if Bob is happy with a 90/10 split!  I'm hoping to get a good chunk of the money early on before the inflation hits too hard."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. Even though I get less than I was hoping for,  it's better to take what I can now before inflation eats away at the value further."
