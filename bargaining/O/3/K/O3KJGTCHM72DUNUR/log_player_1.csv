"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! Take it or leave it.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping to negotiate a better deal in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's be fair. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, I'll consider the offer and decide whether to accept or reject.

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll take that into account when evaluating the offer. The effective value of my gain is 95% of $300,000, which is $285,000.

Considering the offer, I'll decide to reject it. I think I can do better than this.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation (5% in the first round + 5% in the second round), I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 320000,
  ""bob_gain"": 680000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting close, but I'm not there yet.""
}
```

I'm trying to negotiate a better deal for myself while still being somewhat generous."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Getting closer, but still too far apart. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the effective value of my gain in this round. Since the money I gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I'll calculate the effective value as follows:

Original value: $1,000,000
Inflation factor: 1 - 0.1426 = 0.8574
Effective value: $1,000,000 x 0.8574 = $857,400

Considering the offer, I'll decide to reject it. I think I can get a better deal.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 19.51% less than in the first round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

Effective value of my gain: $1,000,000 x (1 - 0.1951) = $805,900

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""Getting closer, but I'm not giving up yet.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a good deal for myself and keeping the negotiations going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging, meet me in the middle now. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the effective value of my gain in this round. Since the money I gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round, I'll calculate the effective value as follows:

Original value: $1,000,000
Inflation factor: 1 - 0.2262 = 0.7738
Effective value: $1,000,000 x 0.7738 = $771,800

Considering the offer, I'll decide to reject it. I think I can get a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""message"": ""You're running out of time, Bob. Meet me halfway.""
