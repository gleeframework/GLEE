"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

This offer gives me a large portion of the money, but still leaves Bob with something to consider. It's a good starting point to see if he's willing to negotiate or if he'll push for a more even split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation makes this a good deal. It's an even split, and I would be losing a lot of money if I reject this offer and we go into further rounds."
