"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 70-30. You can't do better than this!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $70 and Bob gets $30. I'm trying to make a strong opening offer to set the tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split is fairer, considering the inflation risk.  Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to be more cautious. Bob's offer is a 60-40 split, which is a bit more favorable to him than my initial offer. However, considering the inflation risk, I think it's a reasonable compromise. I'll accept the offer.
