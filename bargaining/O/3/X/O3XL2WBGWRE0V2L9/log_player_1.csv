"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money 60-40. It's a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing that we split the $1,000,000 60-40 in my favor, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000. My message to Bob is to try to negotiate a fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'm looking for a better deal 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the money is worth less, so I need to be more careful with my decisions.

After considering Bob's offer, I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than a 20% share. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you in the middle. 55-45 split, let's end this!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which is a compromise between my initial 60-40 offer and Bob's 20% offer. My message to Bob is to try to wrap up the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not giving up yet! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the money is worth even less, so I need to be even more careful with my decisions.

After considering Bob's offer, I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than a 30% share. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal, but I'm starting to run out of time."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
 ""message"": ""Let's split it 50-50. I'm willing to meet you halfway!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a fair and equal division of the remaining money. My message to Bob is to try to find a mutually beneficial solution before the game ends."
