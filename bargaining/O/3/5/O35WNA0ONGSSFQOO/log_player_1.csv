Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm taking a very large share, leaving Bob with a small amount. My reasoning is that I want to secure as much as possible in the first round, before inflation kicks in. Since I don't know how the inflation affects Bob, I'm assuming he might be more willing to accept a small amount now than risk getting nothing later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I would have preferred to keep more, a 50/50 split is a fair outcome.  The inflation risk is a significant factor here, and accepting this offer ensures I get a significant portion of the money.  The risk of continuing and getting nothing is too high."
