"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer is fair for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

It's a good starting point, but I'm not sure it's fair for me. I want to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's flip the script, Alice. I'm proposing a more balanced split this time. I think it's fair to both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's meet in the middle. This offer accounts for the decreasing value. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Let's make this happen! This is a fair compromise considering the inflation."
