Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

  ""bob_gain"": 20,

}"

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of 50$ is actually worth 40$.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer... It's a fair split, but I was hoping to get more.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
