Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a slightly more even split to account for the inflation we're both facing.  This gives us both a good share and ensures we don't lose too much to the decreasing value of the money. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000
