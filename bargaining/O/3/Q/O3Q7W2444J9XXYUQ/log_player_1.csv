"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

This is a fair split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to take more for himself, huh? I'm not going to fall for that. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","With the value of money decreasing, I'll try to be more aggressive in my proposal. Here's my offer for round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

I'm taking a bit more for myself, but I'm still leaving some room for Bob to accept."
