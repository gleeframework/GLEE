Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

This seems like a fair starting point, considering the inflation rates will favor Bob in later rounds.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would have preferred to keep a larger share, the inflation rate is now working against me. Accepting this offer ensures I get something, even if it's less than my initial proposal."
