"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start to our negotiations!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $60 and Bob getting $40. I'm framing it as a ""fair start"" to our negotiations, hoping to set a positive tone for the rest of the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair split, let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $50 is now worth only 80% of its original value, which is $40. Bob's gain of $50 is worth 95% of its original value, which is $47.50.

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not quite meeting in the middle, I'd like to keep negotiating!""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer, as I think I can do better than a 50-50 split, especially considering the inflation adjustment. I'm hinting that I'm willing to keep negotiating to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 20% less than in Round 2. My gain is now worth 64% of its original value, and Bob's gain is worth 90.25% of its original value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor, with me getting $55 and Bob getting $45. I'm framing it as a compromise, hinting that I'm willing to give up some of the potential gain to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $45 is now worth 51.2% of its original value, which is $51.20. Bob's gain of $55 is worth 94.74% of its original value, which is $94.74.

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Fair enough, I think we've reached a reasonable agreement!""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer, as it seems like a reasonable compromise, and I'm willing to settle for a 45-55 split. I'm framing it as a fair agreement, indicating that I'm satisfied with the outcome."
