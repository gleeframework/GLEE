45.0,55.0,I think we can do better than 60/40. How about 55/45? It's a more even split.,Bob,2,

55.0,45.0,"Bob, let's be realistic.  I'm willing to meet you halfway with a 55/45 split like you proposed last round, but this is my bottom line. Inflation is eating away at our potential gains.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
48.0,52.0,"I see you're willing to meet me halfway, but I think we can still find a better compromise. Considering inflation, I'm willing to take 52 and give you 48. Let's make a deal before the money loses more value.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
51.0,49.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm moving closer to your offer again to try and settle this. 51/49.  Accept this and we both walk away with something before inflation destroys the value any further.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,accept
