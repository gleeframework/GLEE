Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the pressure of inflation, but I'm not ready to give up yet. This is my counteroffer, considering the current situation. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While the deal is getting closer to something more reasonable, Bob is still overestimating the value of the money he's getting due to the inflation working against him.  We need to push him closer to a more even split before accepting."
