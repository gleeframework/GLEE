"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a small share and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself, with the message that I'm starting with a fair split and we can negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's start with a 50/50 split.  I'm confident we can find a better deal as the rounds progress. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

Considering the 5% decrease in value for me, $500,000 is equivalent to $475,000 in the first round's value. For Bob, the 20% decrease in value means $500,000 is equivalent to $400,000 in the first round's value.

In this round, I'm still not getting a good deal, as Bob is offering me $475,000, which is less than what I initially proposed in the first round. I'll reject this offer and try to do better in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, the money is worth 5% less for me, so I'll have to adjust my proposal accordingly.

I'll offer Bob a smaller share, but still a significant one, to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I need to keep a significant amount to make this deal worthwhile.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable.  I'm willing to give you a decent amount, but I need a larger share to make it worthwhile for me after the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking its toll! In this round, the money is worth 14.26% less for me, so I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

To calculate the equivalent value in the first round, I'll divide the amount I gain by 0.8526 (1 - 0.1426 = 0.8574, then 1 / 0.8574 â‰ˆ 1.166). This means $400,000 is equivalent to approximately $467,440 in the first round's value.

For Bob, the 48.8% decrease in value means $600,000 is equivalent to approximately $313,200 in the first round's value.

Considering the equivalent values, Bob's offer is actually a better deal than my initial offer in the first round, and it's also better than my offer in the third round. I'll accept this offer.
