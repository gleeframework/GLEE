"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a small share and we can negotiate from here. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While a fair split is tempting, it's too early to accept such a small share.  I want to see what Alice is willing to offer as the rounds progress."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Let's start with a 50/50 split.  I'm confident we can find a better deal as the rounds progress.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I need to keep a significant amount to make this deal worthwhile. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While Alice's offer is better than the first round, it's still not fair considering the inflation. I'm willing to see if she will offer more in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable.  I'm willing to give you a decent amount, but I need a larger share to make it worthwhile for me after the inflation.""
