"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $80 and Bob gets $20, which is a 80-20 split. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finish the game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is better for us both. Let's aim for something closer to the middle. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money, I need to adjust my thinking.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better. The money is worth less, so I want a bigger share to compensate for the reduced value."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 10% less than in the second round, I'll aim for a bigger share. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm aiming for a bigger share, but still willing to compromise!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40, hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finish the game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need a larger share to make this worthwhile. Let's aim for a fairer split. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll! With the reduced value of money, I need to reassess my strategy.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. With the money worth less and less, I think it's better to take what I can get now rather than risking it all and possibly ending up with nothing. Bob's offer of $40 for me and $60 for him seems like a reasonable compromise, especially considering the reduced value of money."
