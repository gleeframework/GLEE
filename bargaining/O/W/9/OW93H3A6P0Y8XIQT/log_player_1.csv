"Round 1

I propose a 9000/1000 split, with me getting 9000 and Bob getting 1000.  This is a fair offer considering the inflation risk.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is worse for me than the first round, even though the inflation affects him more. I'll reject this and make a counter-offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8500, ""bob_gain"": 1500}
```

I'm offering a 8500/1500 split.  I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I still want to get a majority of the money.  Since I know Bob is feeling the pressure of inflation, I'm confident this offer is attractive enough for him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7500 
# Bob gain: 2500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse each round, even though he is being affected by inflation more than me. I'll reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8250, ""bob_gain"": 1750}
```

I'm offering a 8250/1750 split.  I'm trying to find a middle ground that's fair for both of us. The inflation is really starting to hurt Bob, and this offer still gives me a good share of the money. I'm hoping he'll accept this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse each round, and while inflation is hurting him more, I'm not willing to accept such a low amount. I'm still confident I can negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm offering a 8000/2000 split. This is a slight concession from my previous offer but still gives me a significant share. With inflation hitting Bob hard, I believe this offer is fair and might entice him to accept."
