Alice's offer:

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split in my favor is fair, considering the depreciation rate and the fact that we'll both be losing value as the game progresses. This way, we both have a decent amount to start with.""}

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to go down to a 70/30 split in my favor.  This is still a better deal for me than your last offer, and it's more reasonable than the first round. Let's settle this now before we lose too much to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
