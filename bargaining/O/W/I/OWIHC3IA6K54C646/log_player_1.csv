"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split in my favor is fair, considering the depreciation rate and the fact that we'll both be losing value as the game progresses. This way, we both have a decent amount to start with. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
