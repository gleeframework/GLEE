Alice's offer:

I'm Bob, and I'm not going to accept a 50/50 split right away. With inflation in play, I want to see if I can get a better deal for myself.  Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I believe this is a fair start considering the inflation we need to account for. What do you think?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a different division. I am willing to give you more, but it reflects the inflation we've experienced since the last round. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll accept this offer.  While I'd still prefer a larger share, the inflation is starting to hurt, and I'm not confident I can do better in the next round. It's better to take what I can get before the money loses more value."
