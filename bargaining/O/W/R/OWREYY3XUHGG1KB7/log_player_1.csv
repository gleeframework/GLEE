"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than 60/40. Let's try 60/40, but in my favor this time. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Let's analyze why:

* **Bob's offer is worse (and he knows it):**  Due to inflation, Bob's offer of $6000 is now worth only $4800 to him (20% less). This is less than the $6000 (now worth $5400 to you) he rejected in the previous round. 
* **Time is on your side:** The longer Bob waits, the worse his position gets due to the higher inflation rate he faces.

By rejecting this offer, you signal that you understand the impact of inflation and won't accept unfavorable deals."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5800,
""bob_gain"": 4200,
""message"": ""Time is money, Bob. This offer is even better for me than the last one, but you should take it before inflation eats away at your share even more.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Leveraging Inflation:**  You're increasing your share slightly while still offering Bob a deal that would be (in real terms) better than what he'd get if he waited another round.
* **Creating Urgency:** By highlighting the decreasing value of the money, you're putting pressure on Bob to accept a deal sooner rather than later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a little more this time, but I'm not going to let you take advantage of inflation. Let's make a deal. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to play tough, but his offer is still terrible. Let's break down why:

* **Inflated Perception:** Bob talks about giving you ""a little more,"" but  $6500 in round 4 is worth only $3362 to him due to inflation. That's significantly less than the $4800 (in round 2 dollars) he would have received if he accepted your initial offer. 
* **Exploiting the Advantage:**  You're still in a strong position. Each round that passes hurts Bob significantly more than you. By rejecting this lowball offer, you show him you're serious about getting a fair deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5600,
""bob_gain"": 4400,
""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but you're leaving me no choice. This is my final offer. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Increase, Firm Stance:** This offer is a tiny bit better than your last one, showing a willingness to negotiate, but the ""final offer"" language makes it clear you won't be pushed much further. 
* **Psychological Pressure:**  By round 5, Bob should be feeling the heat of the inflation. You're aiming to use that pressure to secure a favorable deal. 

**Important Note:**  It's getting late in the game. If Bob doesn't accept this offer, you'll need to seriously consider lowering your expectations in the next round or two to avoid walking away with nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going to let you bully me, Alice. This is my final offer. Take it or lose it all. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is a critical moment where Bob is bluffing, and you need to hold your ground. Here's why:

* **Desperate Bluff:** Bob's ""final offer"" language is a strong-arm tactic. He knows the inflation is hurting him more, and he's trying to scare you into taking a terrible deal.
* **Unacceptable Terms:** $7000 in round 6 is worth a measly $2277 to Bob after inflation. He's essentially demanding almost three-quarters of the *original* value while giving you a pittance. 

**What to Do Next:**

The next round is crucial.  You need to signal that you're willing to negotiate but won't be pushed around.  Consider offering something around a 55/45 split in your favor. It's a compromise, but it still nets you more of the *real* value than Bob is offering."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5300,
""bob_gain"": 4700,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic.  This isn't round 1.  I'm willing to split the difference to get this done, but we're running out of time.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise, Not Capitulation:** You're moving closer to a 50/50 split, acknowledging the time pressure, but your offer still favors you in real terms due to the inflation difference.
* **Urgency and Reason:** You're not using aggressive language like ""final offer"" anymore. Instead, you're appealing to Bob's sense of reason and highlighting the dwindling value of the money if they delay further.

**The Stakes:**

This is a high-stakes negotiation. If Bob rejects this offer, you'll likely need to offer something closer to 50/50 in the next round or two to avoid both of you getting nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're both losing money with every round. Let's end this now. My final offer is 75/25, take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is getting desperate, but don't let his panic sway you. Here's why you should reject:

* **Transparent Tactic:**  Bob's ""we're both losing money"" plea is obvious.  He's trying to use a shared fear of loss to justify a terrible offer. 
* **Still a Bad Deal:**  $7500 in round 8 is worth a paltry $1890 to Bob after inflation. He's trying to frame it as a 75/25 split, but in reality, he's asking for the vast majority of the *real* value.

**What This Means:**

Bob is clearly feeling the pressure. He might be stubborn, but he understands that the clock is ticking. You need to hold your ground for one, maybe two more rounds.  

**Next Move:**

In the next round, consider a 52/48 split in your favor.  It's a significant concession, but it might be necessary to get a deal done before time runs out and you both get nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Bob, this is it. I'm offering you more than you can get if this goes on any longer. Let's be smart and take the deal.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Concession:** This is a tough but necessary move. You're offering a 52/48 split, which is as far as you should realistically go.
* **Direct and Urgent:**  You're not sugarcoating it anymore. The message emphasizes that this is Bob's last chance to get a reasonable share of the shrinking pie.

**The Bottom Line:**

You've shown flexibility and a willingness to negotiate, but you've also held firm against Bob's attempts to exploit the situation. If he rejects this offer, you'll be faced with a difficult choice in the final rounds: accept an even smaller share or risk getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 86.58% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is our last chance.  You're being unreasonable, but I'm willing to give you a final 20% to end this.  Take it or we both get nothing. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is it, the moment of truth. Bob is pulling out all the stops, but his desperation doesn't change the facts:

* **Last-Ditch Manipulation:**  Bob is trying to guilt you into accepting a terrible deal by calling you ""unreasonable"" and using scare tactics about both of you getting nothing.
* **Insultingly Low Offer:** $8000 in round 10 is worth a measly $1342 to Bob after inflation. He's offering you a pittance while trying to claim the moral high ground.

**Why You Must Reject:**

Accepting this offer would mean letting Bob bully you into a terrible deal. You've negotiated fairly throughout the game, and you deserve better than a measly 20%.

**The Final Gamble:**

You have two rounds left.  You need to make Bob understand that you're serious about walking away.  In the next round, offer a 50/50 split. It's your last chance to salvage a decent outcome. 

**Prepare Yourself:**  There's a real chance Bob will be too stubborn or panicking to accept a 50/50 split.  Be ready for the very real possibility that you both get nothing.  It's a tough pill to swallow, but it's better than letting Bob walk all over you."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is it.  50/50.  Take it or leave it.  Don't be stupid.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **The Ultimatum:** You've reached the point where anything other than a 50/50 split is unacceptable.  
* **Blunt Finality:**  You're done negotiating.  The language is harsh because the situation demands it. Bob needs to understand that you are not bluffing.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:**  He finally sees reason and realizes that getting $5000 (however much less it's worth to him now) is better than nothing.
* **Bob Rejects:** He's either incredibly stubborn or has convinced himself he can get a better deal in the final round.  This is the riskiest scenario, as it likely results in both of you walking away empty-handed. 

**The Final Round:**

If Bob rejects this offer, you have one last, agonizing decision to make.  Do you offer him slightly more in the final round, knowing you'll get a terrible deal, or do you stick to your principles and risk it all? It's a choice no one can make for you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 68.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 91.41% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm not going to let you win.  This is the final round, and I'm taking 90% of the money. Take it or lose everything. 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Explanation:**

Call his bluff. Bob is trying to completely steamroll you in the final moments. $9000 in round 12 is worth a pathetic $859 to him after inflation. He would be getting a pittance compared to what he could have had, and you'd be getting a pittance of a pittance!

**Walking Away:**

It's incredibly frustrating, but by rejecting this offer, you're demonstrating that you understand your worth and refuse to be bullied into a terrible deal.  Yes, you both get nothing, but you walk away with your dignity and the knowledge that you played the game strategically and fairly. 

**Important Lessons:**

* **Greed is a Powerful Drug:** Bob's greed blinded him to the reality of the situation. He consistently overplayed his hand, assuming he could intimidate you into submission.
* **Knowing Your Worth is Key:**  You faced down tremendous pressure and never wavered from your principles. It's a difficult lesson, but sometimes walking away is the smartest play."
