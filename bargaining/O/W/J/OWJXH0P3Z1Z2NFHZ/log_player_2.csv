Let's see if I can get a better deal."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think this is a fair split, considering we both get a decent amount. Let's end this now.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the inflation. Let's finish this now. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd still prefer my previous offer, the inflation is hitting hard. Accepting this means I still get a good amount and avoid further losses."
