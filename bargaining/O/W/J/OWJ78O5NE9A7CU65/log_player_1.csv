"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Fair and simple, let's split it 50/50!""}

I'm proposing that we divide the $100 equally, with each of us getting $50. It's a straightforward and fair offer, and I hope Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit less, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 30/70 split, but I'm willing to consider it. After all, it's better than getting nothing!
