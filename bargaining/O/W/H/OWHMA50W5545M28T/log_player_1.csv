"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm offering to take 60 dollars and leave 40 dollars for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the money I gain is now worth 20% less than in the first round, so I need to be more cautious.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","In Round 3, the money I gain is worth 40% less than in the first round (20% less than Round 2), and I need to make a new proposal.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 30,
  ""bob_gain"": 70
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 37.5 
# Bob gain: 62.5 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is getting worse!

Considering the significant decrease in the value of the money I gain, I'll try to be more aggressive in my negotiation. However, Bob's offer is relatively close to the previous one, and I'm not sure if I can do better.

I'll accept Bob's offer from Round 4.
