Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a fairly aggressive offer. I'll take 90% and leave 10% for Bob.  Since this is the first round, there's no inflation yet, so I'm hoping to secure a large share early on.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer to get more, inflation is starting to bite. Bob's offer is still significantly better than what I'd get if we continue to the next round.  I'll take the 80% and move on."
