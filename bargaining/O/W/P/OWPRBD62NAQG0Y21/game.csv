70.0,30.0,"Let's make a deal! I take $70, you take $30. This seems fair to me considering the inflation we're dealing with.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
40.0,60.0,"Alice, your offer was a bit too greedy for me. Let's be reasonable, I'll take $60 and you get $40. This accounts for the inflation we both face.",Bob,2,

65.0,35.0,"Bob, let's be practical.  My last offer was generous considering the inflation. I'm willing to compromise at $65 for me and $35 for you.  Every round costs us both money.",Alice,3,

45.0,55.0,"Alice, we're running out of time, and this back and forth isn't beneficial for either of us. I'm proposing a more balanced split: $55 for me, $45 for you. Let's close this deal and avoid further losses from inflation.",Bob,4,

60.0,40.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm lowering my offer again to $60 for me and $40 for you.  This is more than fair considering how much inflation is hurting your share.  Let's be done with this.",Alice,5,
