"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```
I'm offering a 50-50 split to start, to see if Bob is willing to accept a fair and equal division."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'd like to get a larger share to compensate for the decrease in value. However, Bob's offer is still quite close to the original 50-50 split, so I'll consider it a fair offer.
