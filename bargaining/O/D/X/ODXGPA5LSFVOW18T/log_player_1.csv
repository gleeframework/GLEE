"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where each of us gets $500,000. It's a simple and straightforward offer, and I hope Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started with a 50/50 split, I'm offering you a slightly lower share this time. Don't get too comfortable! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not going to accept Bob's offer. I'd rather try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""That's a pretty big drop in my share! I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Can you meet me in the middle?""}

I'm hoping Bob will come back with a revised offer that's more to my liking."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 420000, ""bob_gain"": 580000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly bigger share, but I'm not going to give away too much. Let's meet in the middle and make a deal!""}

I'm trying to find a balance between my previous offer and Bob's offer, hoping to find a compromise that works for both of us."
