"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to do better in the next round.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. I'm leaving some room for Bob to negotiate and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to start.  Let's see if we can agree. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation, the money is worth less, but I still need to make the most of it.

I'll analyze Bob's offer:

* Alice gain: $5,000
* Bob gain: $5,000

Considering the inflation, the actual values are:
* Alice gain: $4,000 (80% of $5,000)
* Bob gain: $4,000 (80% of $5,000)

I think this is a reasonable offer, but I'd like to try to get a bit more. I'll reject the offer and make a counter-proposal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Your turn to respond.""
}
```

I'm increasing my share to $6,000 and Bob's share to $4,000, trying to get a slightly better deal for myself."
