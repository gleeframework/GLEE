"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn to respond!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the original 100$, which is $20. I'm taking the remaining 80%. This is a fair starting point, and I'm leaving it up to Bob to decide whether to accept or propose a new split."
