"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 3:1 split in my favor, with me getting $750,000 and Bob getting $250,000. I'm framing this as a fair starting point, and I'm leaving the door open for Bob to negotiate and potentially get a better deal in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started high, I'll meet you in the middle 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth less for him due to inflation!

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You're trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I'm not budging. I'll wait for a better offer.""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and waiting for him to come back with something better."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, and let's call it a day.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50:50 split, which is a more even split than my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finalize the deal."
