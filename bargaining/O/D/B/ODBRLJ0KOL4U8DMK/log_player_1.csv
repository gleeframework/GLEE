Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you wanting to start fair Alice, but I think this is a bit more agreeable for me. Especially considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","This offer is tempting because it's more than I'd get if I just reject and propose the same split in the next round. However, Bob clearly understands the impact of inflation and is using it to his advantage.  Let's see if I can get him to be a bit more generous.

Round 3

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. This offer is a compromise, considering the time pressure and the impact of inflation on your share. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is slowly moving towards a more equitable split, but he's still taking advantage of my shrinking pot. I need to consider that rejecting this offer means the value of my share decreases again, even if I manage to get him to agree to a 50/50 split in the next round. This offer is close enough to my target to be worth accepting.
