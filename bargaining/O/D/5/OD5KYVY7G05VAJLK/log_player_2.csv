"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less after the first round, it's now worth $8,000. My offer is:
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","My offer from round 2 was rejected, and now Alice is making a new offer. Considering the inflation, the money is worth less now.

My calculation:
 Original $10,000 * 0.8 (20% less) = $8,000 (round 1)
 $8,000 * 0.84 (36% less) = $6,720 (round 3)

Alice's offer:
Bob gain: 4500
Alice gain: 5500

Since 4500 is more than half of $6,720, I'll accept the offer to get a higher share.
