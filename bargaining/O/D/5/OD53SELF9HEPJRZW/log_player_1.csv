"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. Since I have 12 rounds to make a deal, I believe it's beneficial to offer a generous amount to Bob in the first round to incentivize him to accept and avoid any potential losses due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, it's not in my best interest to continue rejecting offers. Given the inflation, accepting Bob's offer ensures I get at least $80, whereas continuing could risk getting nothing."
