"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55:45 split.  This is a fair offer, considering the potential for inflation. I believe we both stand to benefit from this agreement, as it allows us to secure a significant portion of the money early on.  Let's avoid the risks of further rounds and get this done! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{
