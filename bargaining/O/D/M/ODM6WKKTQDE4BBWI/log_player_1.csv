"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I, Alice, propose to take $600,000, leaving $400,000 for Bob. The message ""Let's split fairly"" is an attempt to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and persuade him to accept the offer. Since the money is worth 10% less to Bob in each subsequent round, I'm hoping he'll be motivated to accept this offer rather than risking a lower value in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest way to go. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm rejecting this offer because, considering the inflation, I can potentially get a better deal in the next round. Since the money is worth the same to me but 10% less to Bob in each subsequent round, I'm hoping to negotiate a more favorable split. Bob's offer to split it evenly might seem fair at first glance, but given the inflation dynamics, I believe I can do better. Let's proceed to the next round and see what happens!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is more than fair""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I'm proposing to take $650,000, leaving $350,000 for Bob. Given that the money is worth 10% less to Bob in each subsequent round, I believe this offer is more than fair. The message ""Considering inflation, this is more than fair"" aims to remind Bob of the decreasing value of the money to him and persuade him to accept this offer rather than risking an even lower value in the next round."
