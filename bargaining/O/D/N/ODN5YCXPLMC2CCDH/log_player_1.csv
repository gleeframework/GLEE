"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'm willing to compromise.""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount of money, and we can avoid a long negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, I need to adjust my expectations. Since Bob's offer is now effectively $8,000 for me (instead of $10,000), I'm not as excited about it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth 40% less than in the first round. I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think I deserve a larger share.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting desperate, but I still think I deserve a bigger share 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly due to inflation. Bob's offer is now effectively $5,200 for me (instead of $10,000), which is a significant decrease.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept an offer that leaves me with such a small share, especially considering the reduced value of the money. I'll try to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth 61.2% less than in the first round. I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting close to my minimum, but I'm still willing to compromise.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer."
