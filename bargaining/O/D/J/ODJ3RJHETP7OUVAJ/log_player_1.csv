# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting more anxious (which is good), it seems like his calculations are off. The longer this goes on, the more desperate he'll get.  I'm aiming to secure at least 650,000."

}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm showing some flexibility to keep Bob engaged, but still aiming for a favorable outcome.  The slight decrease in my ask might entice him while the reminder of the shrinking pot adds pressure."

# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough one. Bob is definitely feeling the pressure now, but he's still pushing for a bigger share than I want to give up. I'll hold out one more round and see if I can get him closer to 60/40."

""message"": ""Bob, this is my final offer.  Take it or leave it, but the deal won't get any better for you.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to lay down the ultimatum. Bob knows time is running out and this offer is the closest he's going to get to his desired split.  The firm tone might be enough to push him to accept."
