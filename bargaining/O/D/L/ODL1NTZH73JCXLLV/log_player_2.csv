"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle of our previous offers 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 430000,
""alice_gain"": 570000,
""message"": ""This seems like a fair compromise given the circumstances.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's important to appear willing to compromise but also to recognize that Alice's potential gains are diminishing with each round. My offer is slightly better than her last, and the message emphasizes fairness while subtly reminding her that time is on my side."
