Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. It's a good starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is a bit more generous than mine, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll reject his offer and try to do better next time.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In round 3, the money is worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000
}
```

I'm trying to get a bit closer to the original 60-40 split, but still keeping a bit more for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 490000 
# Bob gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value quickly! In round 4, I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money is worth less for both of us, I'll try to take a slightly more aggressive stance.

However, Bob's offer is getting closer to the original 50-50 split, and I'm not sure if I can do better. I'll accept his offer.
