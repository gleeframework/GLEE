"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This is a very aggressive opening offer, giving Bob practically nothing. I want to see if he'll accept this, as there is a good chance he will be greedy and reject it. This strategy might lead to a better outcome for me in later rounds, as he'll be more willing to accept a smaller share if he's already been denied a large one."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is still way too lopsided in Bob's favor, even with the reduced value of the money. It's a clear sign he's trying to take advantage of the situation. I'll reject this and see if he'll be more reasonable in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split in this round.  Bob rejected my very generous offer in the first round, and his counter-offer was incredibly unfair. I believe a 50/50 split is the fairest outcome given the current situation and will hopefully prevent further rounds of negotiation."
