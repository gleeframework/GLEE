"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a decent amount and we can negotiate further""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $30 and keeping $70 for myself. This is a relatively generous offer, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll start with a 50/50 split, let's see if we can improve from here 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my $50 gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so I'll actually receive $45.

I'll accept Bob's offer for a 50/50 split. It's a fair offer, and I don't want to risk going into another round with inflation eating into my potential gain.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
