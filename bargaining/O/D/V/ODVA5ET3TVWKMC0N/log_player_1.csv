"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 900000,
""bob_gain"": 100000,
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Bob. Take this offer and we can both walk away happy.""
}
``` 

This offer heavily favors Alice, but it's the first round and there's a chance Bob will accept to avoid the risk of further devaluation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to divide the money.  Let's end this game now. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

While a 50/50 split seems fair on the surface, the devaluation heavily favors me in the long run. Bob is feeling the pressure already, so I'll hold out for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 700000,
""bob_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""I'm willing to be generous, Bob, but time is money. Let's settle this now and avoid further losses.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is hurting:**  His 50/50 offer shows he's feeling the devaluation pressure. 
* **Strong position:**  I'm still not significantly affected by the inflation.
* **Appearing reasonable:**  Offering a 70/30 split might seem fair to Bob, especially considering the increasing losses he's facing.

I'm hoping this offer entices Bob to settle while still securing a significant advantage for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're both losing money with each round. Let's meet in the middle and split it 60/40. This way we both walk away with a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Devaluation Impact:**  Bob's offer is getting closer to a more even split, and the devaluation is starting to become a factor for me as well, even if it's not as significant as for him.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Holding out for more might backfire.  There's a chance Bob could offer even less in the next round, and the devaluation will continue to eat into the overall pot. 
* **Fair Compromise:**  A 60/40 split isn't ideal, but it's a reasonable compromise considering the circumstances. It guarantees a good sum of money without the risk of further losses."
