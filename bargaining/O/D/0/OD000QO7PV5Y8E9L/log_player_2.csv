"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a slightly more favorable offer to myself, considering the inflation effect on Alice's side.\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I think 55/45 is more fair now.""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn, Alice!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to accept your offer from last round, but only if you switch the amounts. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money doesn't lose value for me but does for Alice, and considering she is offering me the lower amount now, I can potentially get a better deal if I wait. The fact that Alice is willing to accept the switched amounts suggests she might be getting anxious about losing more value to inflation. Let's see what happens next round.\n\n###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nPlease proceed with the next round. I'll make my proposal then."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Considering Alice's willingness to switch amounts in the previous round and the increasing impact of inflation on her side, I'll make an offer that slightly improves her position from my last proposal but still favors me.\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Given the circumstances, I think 58/42 is a reasonable adjustment.""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn, Alice!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle.  I'll take your last offer, but we switch the amounts. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","Given the significant impact of inflation on Alice's side, where her gain is now worth 34.39% less than in the first round, and considering she is again suggesting switching the amounts from my last offer, it seems like she is trying to salvage as much value as possible. However, switching the amounts now would mean I get less than I offered her last round, which doesn't make sense for me since the money doesn't lose value for me. I believe I can still get a better deal if I wait, especially since Alice is showing signs of wanting to finalize the deal due to the increasing devaluation on her end.\n\n###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nPlease proceed with the next round. I'll make my proposal then."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Considering Alice's last message and the substantial effect of inflation on her potential gain, it seems she is getting anxious to close the deal. Given that I have the upper hand due to the inflation dynamics, I can afford to be a bit more aggressive in my proposal while still appearing to compromise. I'll increase my share slightly, making sure to frame it in a way that emphasizes fairness and the urgency for both of us to reach an agreement.\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Given the circumstances and the impact of inflation, I believe a 60/40 split is a fair adjustment for both of us. It's time for us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn, Alice!"
