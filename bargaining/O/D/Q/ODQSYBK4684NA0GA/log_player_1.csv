Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a generous offer.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting already!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. I'm not sure if I'm willing to accept a smaller share.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Time to make a new offer!

Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher share this time.
