"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 90% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob gets 10%. This is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A 50/50 split is a good starting point, but I can do better 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my thinking.

In this round, the total amount is 900,000 (due to 10% inflation from the initial 1,000,000).

Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, but since I'm worth 10% less, I'd be getting 450,000 and Bob would get 450,000.

I'd rather get a better deal, so I'll reject this offer.
