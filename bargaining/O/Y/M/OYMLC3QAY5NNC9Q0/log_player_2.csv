"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 50/50, a fair start! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's tempting to go for the fair split, but with inflation, I want to see if I can get a better deal.  Let's see what Alice proposes in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'd like to propose a 60/40 split. With inflation, we need to be strategic, and this gives us both a good starting point.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share given the initial 50/50 proposal. This 60/40 split is still too generous to Bob. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

I'll accept this offer.  Even though it's less than what I proposed, I'm losing money with each round, and this is a decent compromise.  It's better to get something than risk getting nothing at all."
