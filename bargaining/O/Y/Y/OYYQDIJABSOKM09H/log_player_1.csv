```

  ""alice_gain"": 80,

}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split in my favor, but I'm leaving room for negotiation."

# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gain, I need to be more aggressive in my negotiation. Since Bob's offer is still not in my favor, I'll reject it and try to do better.

}
```"

# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, but I'm not giving up my edge! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50
