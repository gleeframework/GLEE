Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor, giving me 700,000 and Bob 300,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new inflation rates, the effective values are:

Alice's gain: 560,000 (70% of 800,000)
Bob's gain: 475,000 (50% of 950,000)

I'm not willing to accept a 50-50 split, so I'll reject the offer.
