"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself. The message is a bit of a challenge to see if Bob will accept or not!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, Alice. It's the fairest way to go! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","A more generous offer from Bob this time!

I'll analyze the offer:

* If I accept, I'll get $500,000, which is a decent amount, but I was hoping to get more.
* However, the inflation factor is working in my favor, so the $500,000 I'll get in Round 2 is equivalent to $475,000 in Round 1, which is actually a better deal than my initial offer.

Considering this, I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
