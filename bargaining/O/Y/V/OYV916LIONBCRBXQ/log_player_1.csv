"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you a good deal, but don't expect it to get better!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor, which is a relatively generous offer considering the time pressure and the risk of inflation. Now it's Bob's turn!"
