"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

 I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  Let's see if Bob is feeling generous!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer is the best strategy.  The inflation is hurting my potential gains, and Bob's offer is still significantly better than what I might be able to get in the next round."
