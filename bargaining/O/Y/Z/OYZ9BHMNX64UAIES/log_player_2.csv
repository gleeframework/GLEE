"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous this round, Bob.  Let's see if you're willing to accept a fair deal. 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting this offer as I believe I can get a better deal in the next round. With 11 rounds remaining, I'm willing to take the risk of the money being worth 10% less in the hopes of securing a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 60-40 seems fair considering the inflation I'm facing.""}\n\nI'm making an offer that I think is reasonable, taking into account the inflation factor that affects me but not Alice. By offering her 40%, I'm hoping she'll see it as a fair compromise and accept, especially since she seemed willing to negotiate with her initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a significant share. Let's find a solution before we both lose out. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll reject this offer because, despite the inflation, I believe I can still negotiate for a better deal. With 9 rounds remaining, I'm willing to risk further inflation to try and secure a more favorable split. Considering Alice is willing to compromise, I think there's room for further negotiation.\n{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm taking a bit more, but still offering you a significant share. Let's close the deal before it's too late.""}\n\nI'm making an offer that takes into account the increasing pressure of inflation on my potential gains. By offering Alice 45%, I'm hoping she'll see the urgency in accepting a deal before the value of the money decreases further for me. Given that she was willing to offer me 45% in the previous round, I'm hoping that by matching that offer but in my favor, she might be inclined to accept."
