"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair share for both 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the offer seems fair on the surface, the inflation heavily favors me in later rounds. Alice loses value faster than I do. It's in my best interest to let the game continue at least one more round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I'm feeling generous, but let's make it snappy.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Exploiting Inflation:**  Alice's share is losing value quickly. By round 2, her $55 is already worth less to her. I'm aiming for a more favorable split while she's still motivated to take a decent offer.
* **Appearing Reasonable:** I'm not being overly greedy. A 60/40 split might seem acceptable to Alice, especially given the time pressure. 
* **Urgency:** The ""let's make it snappy"" is a subtle nudge to remind Alice that waiting benefits me more than her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** 

* **Diminishing Returns:** While I have the advantage with inflation, the difference in value loss between rounds is shrinking. Holding out indefinitely isn't a foolproof strategy.
* **Reasonable Offer:** Alice is getting slightly more, but it's close to an even split considering the starting point. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  If I reject this, I risk Alice becoming more desperate and offering even less in the next round. It's better to secure a decent amount now."
