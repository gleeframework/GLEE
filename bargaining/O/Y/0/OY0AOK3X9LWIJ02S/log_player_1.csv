"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 400k, but I think I deserve more for being the one to make the first counteroffer! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks he deserves more for making the counteroffer, huh?

I'll consider the offer, but I'm not willing to give up too much. Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, I'll aim to get as much as possible.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I reject Bob's offer and want to make a counteroffer in Round 3."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, I'll aim to get a bit more to compensate for the decrease in value.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slight edge, but I'm not giving up too much!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45/55 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than the 50/50 split in the first round."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve more than 30% of the total. You're going to have to do better than that! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering the significant decrease in the value of the money, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since Bob is willing to compromise, I'll try to get as much as possible.

However, I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me less than 40% of the total. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to get closer to 50% to make it worth my while!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42/58 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than the previous offers."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really eating away at my potential earnings!

Considering the significant decrease in the value of the money, I'll have to make a tough decision. Bob is right that I need to make a serious offer if I want to get closer to 50%. However, I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me less than 40% of the total.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
