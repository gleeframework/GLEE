"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm starting with a generous offer, giving Bob a decent amount. I want to see if he's willing to accept a quick deal, or if he's more greedy and wants to risk inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is better than what I would have gotten if I had accepted in the first round, but I'm not convinced it's a good deal. The money is rapidly losing value. I'm going to try to get a better deal by playing it safe and seeing what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm increasing my offer to 700,000, still keeping a significant portion for myself. This is a more balanced offer, and I hope it will be enough to incentivize Bob to accept before the inflation kicks in further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly unfair, even though my share has decreased due to inflation. I'm still hoping to get a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to 600,000, but still maintaining a significant portion for myself. Inflation is hitting hard, and I need to secure something before it becomes too late.  I believe this offer reflects the current value of the money and might be attractive enough for Bob to accept."
