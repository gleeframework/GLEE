"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose to keep 900,000$ and give Bob 100,000$. This way I get most of the money and Bob gets a little something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000 to avoid another round of inflation and make sure we both get a good amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though the money is worth less now, accepting this offer is the best option. If I reject, the next round will see further inflation, which would likely leave me with even less. This offer at least guarantees me a decent amount."
