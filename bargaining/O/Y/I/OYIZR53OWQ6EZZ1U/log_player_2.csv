Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you want a larger share, Bob, but your previous offer was too low for me. This is a more balanced proposal, considering the inflation is hitting me harder. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500
