"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% and Bob gets 40%. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bigger share, but not that big! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth 10% less, so I'd be getting 0.9 * 60 = 54$ if I accepted the original offer.

Bob's new offer is 70$ for me, which is 70 * 0.9 = 63$ in the original amount. That's a good increase!

I'll accept Bob's offer for 63$.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
