"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
 
I propose that I get $9000 and Bob gets $1000. This is a good starting point, considering I have the advantage of not having any inflation on my share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is unfair, as he is taking advantage of the inflation rate and trying to get the majority of the money. I will reject his offer and continue to play the game."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
``` 

I'm still aiming for a large portion of the money, but I'm willing to lower my share slightly to incentivize Bob to accept.  With the inflation rate, my share is still worth the same as in the first round, while Bob is losing value on his share each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While I'm losing out on the potential to get a bigger share of the money, Bob is being greedy. He is trying to take advantage of the inflation rate and is not being reasonable. I will continue to play the game and try to negotiate a fairer outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm lowering my share again, but I'm still holding on to a good portion of the money.  Bob's share is worth significantly less now due to inflation, so hopefully this will encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still trying to take the lion's share despite his share being significantly devalued by inflation. I'm not willing to accept such a lopsided offer. I'll continue playing the game, hoping he'll eventually realize the need to be more reasonable."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm continuing to lower my share, but I'm still holding on to the majority of the money. Bob's share is becoming increasingly devalued, so hopefully, this will be enough to incentivize him to accept.  We are running out of time, and I'm willing to compromise to avoid getting nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still being stubborn and trying to get the better end of the deal despite the fact that his share is worth less than half of what it was originally.  He's taking a big risk by rejecting my offer and I'm confident that I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

We're running out of time and the inflation is really hurting Bob. I'm offering an even split now, hoping he'll realize that it's better to take what he can get than risk losing everything."
