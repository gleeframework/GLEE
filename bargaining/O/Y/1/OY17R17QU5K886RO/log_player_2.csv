"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, I'll take the smaller share this round 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While it's tempting to take the guaranteed 40 dollars, this game emphasizes strategy and potentially maximizing your gains. By rejecting, Bob forces Alice to propose next round, and Bob can potentially negotiate a better deal for himself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 51, ""alice_gain"": 49, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a slightly larger share this time, but I'm open to negotiation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take a slightly larger share this time, but I'm still open to negotiation 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While Alice's share seems larger, remember the inflation affects her gains more significantly.  Accepting this offer guarantees a gain of 45 for Bob, which is better than risking rejection and potential lower gains in future rounds."
