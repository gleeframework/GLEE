"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, 60-40, and see if we can improve from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $60 and Bob getting $40. The message is a friendly opening offer, suggesting we start with a fair split and see if we can negotiate from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55-45 split is fairer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the actual amounts would be:

* My gain: $45 * 0.95 = $42.75
* Bob's gain: $55 * 0.95 = $52.25

I'm not too thrilled about the 45-55 split, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm comfortable with a 45-55 split. Can we try to get closer to 50-50?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and the previous offers, I'll make a new proposal. Since the money is worth less, I'll aim for a slightly larger share to compensate for the reduced value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway at 55-45. Let's see if this works for you.""
}
```

This time, I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor, with me getting $55 and Bob getting $45."
