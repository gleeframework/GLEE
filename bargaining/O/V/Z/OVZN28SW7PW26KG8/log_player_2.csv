Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be reasonable, but we're losing valuable time.  This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
While I would prefer more, it's getting risky with the continued inflation. Accepting this offer ensures I get something, even if it's less than ideal."
