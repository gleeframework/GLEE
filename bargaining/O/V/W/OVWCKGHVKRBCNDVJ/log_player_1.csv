"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a moderate offer.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, my gain of 6000 in the first round is now equivalent to 6000 / 1.1 = 5455 in the second round.

Considering Bob's offer, I get 5000, which is more than my equivalent gain of 5455. I'll reject this offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, my previous gain of 5455 is now worth 5455 / 1.1 = 4945 in the third round.

I'll make a new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the equivalent value of my previous gain in the third round. I had 4945, which is now worth 4945 / 1.1 / 1.1 = 4395 in the fourth round.

Considering Bob's offer, I get 4800, which is more than my equivalent gain of 4395. I'll accept this offer.
