Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm starting with a 60/40 split in my favor.  I think this is fair, as I'm only losing 5% of the value per round while Bob loses 10%.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

Even though this offer is worse for me than my initial proposal, the inflation is hitting Bob harder. It's likely he won't offer me more in the next round, so I'll take what I can get."
