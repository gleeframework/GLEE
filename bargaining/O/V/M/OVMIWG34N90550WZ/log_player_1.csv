"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This is a fair offer, with me getting 60% of the initial $10,000 and Bob getting 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob wants to flip the script on me!

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my decision accordingly. With the reduced value of the money, Bob's offer is actually a better deal for me than my original offer.

I accept Bob's offer.
