"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money 60-40, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me $600,000 and Bob $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 65-35 split is fairer, considering the risk of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation kicking in, I need to be more cautious.

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not comfortable with the 65-35 split, and I'd like to see a more favorable ratio for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and split the money 50-50, a fair compromise!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping to find a middle ground that works for both of us."
