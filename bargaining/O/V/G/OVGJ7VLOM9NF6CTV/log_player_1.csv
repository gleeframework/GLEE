"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to get this over with!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than 50/50.  Let's try 60/40, I'll take the bigger share this time, and we can split it more evenly next round. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I'll consider it. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not too concerned about inflation yet.

I'll reject this offer and make a counter-proposal for the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to give you the bigger share this time. Let's try 55/45 instead!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""You got a smaller share this time, but I'm willing to meet you halfway!""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed!"
