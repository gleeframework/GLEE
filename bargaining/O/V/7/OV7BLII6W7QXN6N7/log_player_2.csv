Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Alice's offer was 2000 for me, I'll try to get a better deal. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a higher share.

{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 36% less now, the value of my potential gain is lower. Alice's offer is a 50/50 split, which is a reasonable compromise considering the reduced value of the money. I'll accept this offer.
