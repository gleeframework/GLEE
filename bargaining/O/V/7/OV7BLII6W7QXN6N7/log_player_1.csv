"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm offering you $2,000, and I'll take the remaining $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll think carefully about this offer. Since I'll gain $6,000, but it's worth 20% less than the $8,000 I initially offered, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject.

For now, I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split, hoping it's more appealing to Bob this time."
