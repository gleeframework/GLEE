"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80/20, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80/20 split, giving me $8,000 and Bob $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's compromise, my turn now 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $7,000 is actually worth 90% of $8,000 (since 10% less), and Bob's gain of $3,000 is worth 95% of $2,000 (since 5% less).

I'm not too thrilled about the split, but I'll consider it. I'll decide to...

{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the total value of the money is decreasing. I'll make a new offer to try to get a better deal.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting closer, but I need a bit more!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, giving me $6,000 and Bob $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Getting closer, but still not there 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation:

My gain of $5,500 is worth 54.9% of $8,000 (since 10% less for 3 rounds, 0.9^3 = 0.729, and 10,000 * 0.729 = 7,290, then 7,290 * 0.745 = 5,450, but I'll use the 5,500 value as per the offer, which is close enough), and Bob's gain of $4,500 is worth 75.6% of $2,000 (since 5% less for 3 rounds, 0.95^3 = 0.857375, and 2,000 * 0.857375 = 1,714.75, then 1,714.75 * 0.952 = 1,632.15, but I'll use the 4,500 value as per the offer, which is close enough).

I'll consider it and decide to...
