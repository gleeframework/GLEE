"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal. I get $6,000, you get $4,000. This way we both benefit from ending the game quickly. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nIn this scenario, accepting the offer would give Bob $4,000, but since the money's value decreases by 20% each round for Bob, he might be motivated to try for a better deal in the next round, hoping the decrease in value will incentivize Alice to offer more or compromise further. Given the rules, Bob likely believes he can negotiate for a larger share before the value drops significantly."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the devaluation, I think this split is more fair. Let's end this before the money loses more value for me.""}\n\nIn this response, Bob is taking into account the devaluation of the money for him and trying to negotiate a better deal than what Alice initially offered. By suggesting a split of $5,500 for himself and $4,500 for Alice, Bob is attempting to find a middle ground that acknowledges the urgency for him due to the devaluation, while still being somewhat considerate of Alice's interests to keep her engaged in the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the situation with devaluation, but your last offer was too low for me. Let's meet in the middle - I take $5,500, you take $4,500 and we both avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nGiven the circumstances, Bob realizes that the value of the money for him is decreasing rapidly (36% less than the original value at this point). Alice's offer of $4,500, although less than what Bob had hoped for, becomes more appealing as the rounds progress and the value of the money continues to drop. By accepting this offer, Bob avoids further devaluation and secures a tangible amount, recognizing that prolonging the negotiation could result in an even less favorable outcome due to the inflation factor affecting his share."
