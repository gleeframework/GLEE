"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

**Explanation:**

This offer gives Alice a large majority of the money, but it still leaves Bob with something. This is a reasonable starting point, as Alice has the first offer and can take advantage of the fact that Bob's money will depreciate at a faster rate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Explanation:**

While this offer is tempting at first glance, it's important to consider the inflation rates.  Accepting this offer means Alice only gets $50,000, while Bob gets a massive $950,000. However, the next round, Alice would be able to propose a deal where she gets 950,000 and Bob gets 50,000, but with the inflation, it will be equivalent to Alice getting 902,500 and Bob getting 47,500. This means Alice will gain significantly more if she rejects this offer and waits for the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 950000, ""bob_gain"": 50000}
```

**Explanation:**

This offer is designed to be more appealing to Bob than the previous offer he made.  While it still gives Alice the majority, it's closer to a 50/50 split than the previous round's offer.  Bob's money will depreciate significantly in the next round, and Alice knows that he might be more willing to accept a smaller gain now to avoid losing more later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Explanation:**

While this offer is more favorable to Alice than Bob's previous offer, it's still not a good deal in the long run.  Considering the inflation rates, Alice is better off waiting for the next round and proposing a deal that gives her a larger share.  

Let's break down why:

* **Alice's Current Gain:** $250,000
* **Bob's Current Gain:** $750,000

If Alice rejects this offer, the next round she will be able to offer Bob $250,000, and get herself $750,000.  However, due to inflation, Bob's gain will be worth only 72.9% of what it is now, which is roughly $546,750.

This means that Alice will be able to secure $750,000, while Bob will only get $546,750. This is a much more favorable deal for Alice, making it worthwhile to reject the current offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

**Explanation:**

This offer is designed to be a fair compromise while still taking advantage of Bob's depreciating money. It's a significant increase from Bob's previous offer, but it still leaves him with a substantial share.  Since Bob has been rejecting offers that favor Alice more, this offer shows willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a favorable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Explanation:**

While this offer is tempting at first glance, it's important to consider the inflation rates.  Accepting this offer means Alice only gets $100,000, while Bob gets a massive $900,000. However, the next round, Alice would be able to propose a deal where she gets 900,000 and Bob gets 100,000, but with the inflation, it will be equivalent to Alice getting 702,000 and Bob getting 59,050. This means Alice will gain significantly more if she rejects this offer and waits for the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

**Explanation:**

This offer is designed to be a very appealing offer for Bob, while still giving Alice a very large portion of the money.  Bob's money is depreciating rapidly at this point, and he may be more inclined to accept a smaller share to avoid losing even more in the next round.  This offer gives Alice a significant advantage without pushing Bob too far and potentially leading to another rejection."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Explanation:**

This offer is a clear attempt by Bob to exploit Alice's dwindling share of the money due to inflation.  While it might seem tempting to accept something rather than nothing, Alice is better off rejecting this offer and waiting for the next round. 

Here's why:

* **Alice's Current Gain:** $1,000
* **Bob's Current Gain:** $999,000

In the next round, Alice will be able to propose a deal where she gets $999,000 and Bob gets $1,000. Due to inflation, this will be equivalent to Alice getting approximately $700,000 and Bob getting approximately $580.  

By rejecting this offer, Alice ensures that she gets significantly more money in the next round, even with the continued inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

**Explanation:**

This is the final round, and Alice can finally secure the vast majority of the money. Bob's money has depreciated significantly, and he is likely to accept any offer at this point. This offer gives Bob a tiny token amount, but it ensures Alice gets the most possible value from the deal."
