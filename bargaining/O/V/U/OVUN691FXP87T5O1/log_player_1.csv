Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to go a little higher, but this is my final offer. It's the best we can do with the time we have left.

# Bob gain: 45

It's getting dangerously close to the deadline, and Bob is unlikely to offer anything better than this. Accepting ensures you get something rather than nothing."
