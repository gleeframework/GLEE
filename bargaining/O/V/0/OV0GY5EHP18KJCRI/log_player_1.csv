"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40. It's a fair start.""
}
```

This way, I'll get $6,000 and Bob will get $4,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try for a more equal split this time! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll calculate the actual amounts:

* My gain: $5,000 / 0.9 = $5,555.56 (approximately)
* Bob's gain: $5,000 / 0.8 = $6,250 (approximately)

Considering the inflation, Bob's offer is actually quite generous! I think I'll accept this offer.
