I'm going to start with a generous offer, hoping Bob will accept. I want to secure most of the money but also show good faith. Let's see how this plays out!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

This is a tough one!  Bob is being very greedy.  I'm going to reject his offer and hope he'll be more reasonable in the next round.  I'm going to try to hold out and see if his desire for the money decreases as the rounds go on."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but I'm still aiming for a significant share of the money.  I'm hoping that Bob will see that the game is getting tighter and that he'll want to settle for something sooner rather than later."

# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is even worse than before! He's clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation.  I'm going to keep rejecting these offers and see if he'll start to come down a bit.  I'm still confident that I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

Bob is getting increasingly greedy.  I am sticking to my guns and rejecting his offer.  I believe we can still reach a more equitable agreement if we keep playing."
