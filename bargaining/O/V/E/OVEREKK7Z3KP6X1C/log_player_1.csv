"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, with me getting 6,000 and Bob getting 4,000. I think this is a good starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is a bit more fair, reflecting the effort we both put in. Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too thrilled about the 55/45 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'm not too concerned about the inflation.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
