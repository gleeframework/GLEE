"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! Take 30, I'll take 70. It's a fair start.""
}
```

I'm proposing that Bob gets $30 and I get $70."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is a bit more balanced. Let's see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth less now, but I'm still looking for a good deal.

I accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
