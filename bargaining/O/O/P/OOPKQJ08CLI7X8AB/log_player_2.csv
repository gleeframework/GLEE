"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I'll take most of the money now, but you'll have a chance to get more later if you reject this offer. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Alice is trying to take advantage of the inflation.  I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think it's fairer to split the money closer to 60/40. We both still get a good amount, and we can avoid the risk of inflation eating away at our share.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to give you more now to avoid further inflation risks. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a 60/40 split, accepting this offer is the best choice.  Inflation is a real risk, and I don't want to keep pushing and end up with nothing."
