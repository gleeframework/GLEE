""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see your point about inflation. Let's meet in the middle. I'm offering 55/45, which is a fair compromise given the changing value of the money.  Let's end this game and move on. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000
