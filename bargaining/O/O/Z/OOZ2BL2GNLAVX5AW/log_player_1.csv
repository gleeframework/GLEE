Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept.  After all, even $1 is better than nothing, and it sets a precedent for future negotiations.  Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, it's better to take the 500,000 now than risk getting nothing if I reject and then Bob offers me less in the next round.  It's a fair deal, and inflation is a real threat!"
