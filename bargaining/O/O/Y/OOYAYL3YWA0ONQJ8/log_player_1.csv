"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair!""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a 60-40 split in my favor, with a message encouraging Bob to accept and be fair. Since the money's value decreases with each round, I want to try to reach an agreement quickly. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want to be fair, but the value of the money decreases rapidly for you. This offer ensures a better outcome for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money's value decreases rapidly for me, I need to consider the current offer carefully. Although Bob's offer of a 40-60 split in his favor seems unfair at first, I must take into account the decreasing value of the money in each round. Let's calculate the actual value of the money for both of us in this round.\n\nFor me, the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, which means it's now worth 80% of its original value. So, if I accept Bob's offer of $40, I'll actually get $40 * 0.8 = $32.\n\nFor Bob, the money is worth 5% less than in the first round, which means it's now worth 95% of its original value. If I accept his offer, he'll get $60 * 0.95 = $57.\n\nConsidering the rapidly decreasing value of the money for me, this offer might be a better outcome than proceeding to the next round. I'll accept Bob's offer to secure the $32 value for myself.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nWait, I changed my mind. Since it's still early in the game, I think I have a chance to get a better offer in the next round. I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know the outcome."
