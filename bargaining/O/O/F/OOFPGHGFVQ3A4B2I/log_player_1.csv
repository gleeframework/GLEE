"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

This is a fairly even split, but it gives me a slight advantage. I'm hoping Bob will accept it, but if not, I'll adjust my offer in the next round to account for the inflation disadvantage he'll face."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a fair offer, and considering Bob's inflated disadvantage, it's likely the best I'll get.  Accepting it is the most sensible move."
