I'm going for a generous first offer.  I'm hoping to secure a quick agreement and avoid the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is a significant improvement from his previous one, it still doesn't seem fair considering the inflation factor. I'm hoping to secure a better deal for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm aiming for a compromise here. The inflation has hit me harder, so I need to increase my share slightly. Hopefully, this will be enough to sway Bob into accepting the offer."
