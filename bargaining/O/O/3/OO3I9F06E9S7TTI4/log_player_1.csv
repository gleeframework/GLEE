"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and square.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60/40 is a more fair split, considering the work I put in to get us this far. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not convinced by Bob's argument that he deserves a larger share just because he made an offer. I think a 60/40 split is too skewed in his favor.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Now it's my turn again. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer, considering the inflation has already reduced the value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting 60/40, Bob. You'll have to do better than that.""
}
```

I'm offering a 55/45 split, which is still a decent compromise, but I'm trying to squeeze a bit more out of the deal. Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Okay, I'm willing to compromise. Let's go with 55/45. This is a fair split, given that we've both had to make concessions. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to backtrack on his previous offer and go back to the same 55/45 split I proposed earlier. I'm not going to fall for that. I think I can do better than that.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to push the boundaries a bit further. Considering the inflation has reduced the value of the money, I'll aim for an even better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 525000,
  ""bob_gain"": 475000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting out of this that easily, Bob. I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm not going to give in completely.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will finally accept this offer!"
