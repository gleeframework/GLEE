"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair division, with me taking 90% and you taking 10%.  It's a good start, and I'm sure we can reach a more equitable agreement in the future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer is heavily skewed in Alice's favor. While she claims it's a starting point, the impact of inflation means waiting for future rounds will significantly devalue the money, especially for her. It's worth seeing if she'll propose something more reasonable in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer was heavily imbalanced. Let's be realistic.  I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This recognizes that delaying benefits me more than you due to the inflation difference.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money evenly this time. It's a fair compromise, considering the inflation we both have to deal with. This way we both get something, and we avoid the risk of getting nothing at all. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a much fairer offer than her initial proposal. While accepting in round 2 would have been ideal,  a 50/50 split is reasonable at this stage.  The longer the game goes on, the more the shrinking pot will hurt Alice, but there's no guarantee she'll offer anything better in subsequent rounds."
