"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 70, you take 30.""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount, and it's a good starting point for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll match your fairness, but I think I deserve a slight edge. This is my first offer. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think 50-50 is a bit too even, considering the inflation affects us differently. I'd like to get a slightly better deal to compensate for the reduced value of my share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slight edge, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation. This is my revised offer.""
}
```

I'm willing to give Bob a slightly smaller share, but I'm still trying to get a decent amount to compensate for the reduced value of my share due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a smaller share, but I think this is a fair split considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's new offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not comfortable with giving Bob a 60% share, especially considering the inflation affects us differently. I'd like to get a better deal to make up for the reduced value of my share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation. This is my revised offer.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a decent share and getting a fair amount for myself, considering the inflation effects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging much, but I'm willing to give you a slight edge to get this deal done. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's new offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think 45-55 is a reasonable split, considering the inflation effects. I'm willing to accept this offer to end the game, especially since Bob is willing to give me a slightly larger share."
