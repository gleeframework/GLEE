"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a very lopsided offer.  I figure Bob might accept it, but if not, I'll be able to negotiate a better deal for myself in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred to keep more money, I'm not sure I can do better than this in the long run. Inflation will eat away at Bob's share, but also at mine.  Accepting this offer means we both get a decent amount."
