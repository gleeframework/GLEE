"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take 80% and you get 20%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split, with me taking the larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being greedy, Alice. I'll take the majority, but I'll give you a small consolation prize. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of me!

I'm not interested in a 9:1 split, especially since my share is worth 20% less due to inflation. I'd rather wait for a better offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Given the inflation, I'll have to adjust my expectations. Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Let's meet in the middle and split it 60-40""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, Alice. I'll give you a little more, but don't expect any sympathy. 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to squeeze me out! Given the significant inflation, my share is worth much less than I initially thought, and I'm not sure if I can do better.

However, I'm not ready to accept this offer yet. I'd like to see if I can get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","At this point, I need to be more aggressive to try to get a better deal. Given the inflation, my share is worth significantly less, and I need to take a bigger share to make up for it.

Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not getting any younger, Bob. I need a better deal. 70-30 or I walk""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting close to desperation, Alice. I'll give you a slightly better deal, but don't think you're getting the better end of this. 
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of my desperation! With the inflation, my share is worth almost 2/3 less than it was initially, and I'm not sure if I can do better.

However, I'm not ready to accept this offer yet. I'd rather try to squeeze a bit more out of Bob.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","At this point, I'm getting close to the point where I'll have to accept a very unfavorable deal. I'll try to be more aggressive and see if I can get a better offer.

However, I'll also consider the fact that Bob has been making offers that are getting progressively worse for me, and I might be better off accepting a deal that's not ideal rather than risking getting an even worse one.

Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm running out of patience, Bob. This is my final offer. Take it or leave it""
}
