"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
``` 
 
I propose we split the money 60/40 in my favor. This is a fair starting point, considering I only lose 10% of the value each round while Bob loses 20%.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take something, his offer is significantly worse than my initial proposal.  I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I propose a 50/50 split this round.  Bob's offer in the previous round was too unfair, and now that inflation has taken its toll on both of us, a more equitable division seems like the best way to ensure we both get something decent."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While my gains are significantly less than my initial goal, Bob's offer is the best I'm likely to get given the continuing inflation. Accepting this offer is the most pragmatic decision, as further rounds would only further devalue my potential gains."
