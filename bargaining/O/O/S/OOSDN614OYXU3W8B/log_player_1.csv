  ""alice_gain"": 600000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55:45 split. This gives you a larger share, but accounts for the increased inflation for you in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
