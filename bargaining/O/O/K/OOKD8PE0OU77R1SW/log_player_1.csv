Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 990,000 to 10,000 split in my favor. I figure I'll take the lion's share, but I'll give Bob a small amount just to be nice. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}

While I'd prefer more, a 50/50 split is a fair deal considering the inflation.  It's better than getting nothing!"
