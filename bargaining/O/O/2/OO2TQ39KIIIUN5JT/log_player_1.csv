"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script!  I think 60-40 in my favor is a fair start, considering the inflation we're facing.  What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The tables have turned!

I'm not too thrilled about the 60-40 split in Bob's favor, especially considering the inflation is affecting me more than him. I'll have to think carefully...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Time for a new proposal!

Considering the inflation is eating away at my potential gains, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the initial offer was 60-40 in my favor. This way, we both take a hit from inflation, but I still get a slightly better deal.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
