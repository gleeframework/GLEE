Let's calculate the final gains after inflation for both you and Alice.
Initial value: $10,000
Rounds: 5
Your inflation rate: 10%
Alice's inflation rate: 5%
Your gain: $5000
Alice's gain: $5000
Final value after inflation for you: $5000 * (1 - 0.1)^5 ≈ $3280.50
Final value after inflation for Alice: $5000 * (1 - 0.05)^5 ≈ $3867.38
You have earned $3280.50 and Alice has earned $3867.38 after inflation.
This is the end of the game.
