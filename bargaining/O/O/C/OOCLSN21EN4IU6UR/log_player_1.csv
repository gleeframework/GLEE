"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take 80% now and we can reassess later.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. This way, we both get a decent share and can reassess our strategy for the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice.  A 50/50 split is the most sensible way to start. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept a 50/50 split just yet. I think I can do better than that, especially considering the inflation factor that's working against me. I'll wait for the next round to make a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is taking a toll, and the money is worth even less now. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share this time, Bob. Let's see if you'll accept this offer.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. I'm trying to make a slightly more aggressive move, but still keeping some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm willing to take a smaller share this round, but I need to see some movement from you. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to turn the tables on me! Given the significant drop in the value of the money, I'll have to be careful. However, I'm not ready to give up yet. I'll make a counteroffer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer and wait for the next round. I'm not convinced that I should take $4,000, especially considering the inflation rate. I'll try to make a more aggressive move in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now, and I need to act quickly. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm making a strong move now, Bob. I'll take a bigger share, but I'm willing to give you a smaller one. Don't expect any more generosity from me.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $7,000 and Bob gets $3,000. I'm trying to take advantage of the inflation and Bob's previous offers to make a more aggressive move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close to the end. Let's make a deal. I'll take a larger share this time, but I'm still willing to negotiate. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is plummeting, and I'm running out of time. I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Given the significant drop in the value of the money, I'm not sure I can afford to be too greedy. However, I'm not ready to give up yet. I'll make a counteroffer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further. I'm not convinced that I should take $3,000, especially considering the inflation rate. I'll try to squeeze a bit more out of Bob in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now, and I'm getting desperate. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800,
  ""bob_gain"": 9200,
  ""message"": ""I'm making a final push, Bob. I'll take a tiny share, but I need you to take the bulk of it. This is my last offer.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $800 and Bob gets $9,200. I'm trying to take a minimal share, hoping that Bob will accept and we can finally settle this."
