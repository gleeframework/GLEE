"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and divide it 60-40! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see if we can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I think a 60-40 split is fairer, with me getting 60% since I'm the one making the proposal this round.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise a bit. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer ensures I get something, and Alice's gain is significantly reduced due to inflation. It's a reasonable compromise."
