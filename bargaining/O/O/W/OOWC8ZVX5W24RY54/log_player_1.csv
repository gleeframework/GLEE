"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or proceed to the next round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can do better than that, I'm willing to compromise! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob thinks he can do better than me?

Okay, let me consider the offer...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I don't think I'm getting a fair share. The money is worth 5% less now, so I'd like to aim for a higher percentage of the remaining amount. I'll make my own counteroffer in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Time for my counteroffer!

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, 55-45 is a fair compromise!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to a 55-45 split, taking into account the 10% decrease in value due to inflation. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or proceed to the next round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I'm still not satisfied. I want a better deal! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob's still not satisfied?

Let me think...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I'm getting a worse deal than before, considering the inflation. The money is worth 14.26% less now, so I'd like to aim for a higher percentage of the remaining amount. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Time for my next move!

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
 ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 50-50 is a fair split!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, taking into account the significant inflation that has occurred so far. I think this is a fair and reasonable offer, considering the decreased value of the money. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or proceed to the next round!"
