"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}

This offer is a bit aggressive, giving me a large share and leaving Bob with a small amount. However, it's important to establish a starting point and see how Bob reacts.  We'll see how this plays out in the next rounds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a much fairer offer, and I don't want to risk losing even more money due to inflation. Accepting this offer guarantees me half of the money, which is a good outcome."
