"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

I'm going to start with a very aggressive offer.  I figure Bob is more likely to accept a small amount than to risk getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject Bob's offer. This is a classic example of the ultimatum game, and I'm not going to accept such a lopsided split. There are still 10 rounds left, and I believe I can negotiate a fairer outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999900, ""bob_gain"": 100}
```

I'm going to increase my offer to Bob slightly, but still keep the majority of the money for myself.  I hope that this will show Bob I'm willing to compromise, and that I'm not just trying to steal all the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100 
# Bob gain: 999900 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still not going to accept such a small amount.  There are still many rounds left, and I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000} 
```

I'm increasing my offer to Bob significantly. This shows good faith and a willingness to compromise. Hopefully, this offer will be more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I am still not going to accept such a small amount, even though Bob has increased his offer.  The pattern here is clear, and I am confident we can reach a more equitable solution in the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

This is a 50/50 split. I believe this is a fair and reasonable division of the money, given that we are both equally likely to receive the entire amount."
