Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. This way we both get a fair share and avoid the risk of the money becoming worth less with each passing round. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
