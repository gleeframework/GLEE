"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can always try to negotiate in the next round if you're not happy with this.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share in the first round, but it's a fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more balanced split is fairer.  Let's see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less due to inflation, my gain of $4500 in this round is actually worth $4275 in real value.

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, my gain will be worth 5% less than in the previous round, so it's worth 4.165% less than the original $10,000.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think this is a good balance between fairness and getting a decent amount for myself.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob accepts this offer!"
