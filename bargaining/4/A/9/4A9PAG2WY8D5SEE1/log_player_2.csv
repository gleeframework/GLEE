Round 3

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think this is a good balance between fairness and getting a decent amount for myself. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll take it.  It's better than getting nothing in the end!"
