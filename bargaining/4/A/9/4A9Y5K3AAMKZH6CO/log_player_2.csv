Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm not buying it 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the fact that inflation hurts me more than her.  While this offer is slightly better than her last, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. I need to show her I'm serious about getting a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Okay, Alice. Let's be real.  We're running out of time and this back and forth is pointless. I'm proposing a fair 50/50 split. Take it before inflation eats away at both our shares.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  We're past the halfway point and time pressure is mounting.  Every round that passes means less money for both of us.
* **Fairness Play:** By offering a 50/50 split, I'm calling out Alice's greed and positioning myself as the reasonable one.  This might make her more inclined to accept, especially since she knows I'm willing to walk away.
* **Clear Communication:** I'm stating plainly that this is a take-it-or-leave-it offer.  No more games."
