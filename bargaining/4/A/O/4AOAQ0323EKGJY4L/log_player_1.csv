"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my offer and we can split the money fairly. You'll get $4,000 and I'll get $6,000.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable for the first round. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, it's a fair start 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting the money!

I'm not too thrilled about the 50/50 split, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth less now, I'll aim to get a bit more. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now!

Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation. Take this offer and let's move forward.""
}
```

I'm trying to get a bit more, but I'm still being reasonable given the circumstances. Let's see if Bob accepts this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a smaller share to account for inflation, but I think this is a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on the money!

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, as I was hoping to get more. However, Bob is offering a slightly higher amount than my previous offer, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with even less value.

I'll accept this offer, hoping that I'll be able to negotiate better in the next rounds.
