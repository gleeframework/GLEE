"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and get this over with!""
}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where each of us gets $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking a slight advantage this round, but I'm open to negotiation. Let's see what you think. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob taking a slight advantage, but I'm willing to negotiate. Here's my response:

{
""decision"": ""reject"",
""message"": ""I'm not happy about the 60/40 split. I was thinking more like 55/45 or 52.5/47.5. Can you meet me in the middle?""
}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and trying to negotiate a more balanced split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{
""alice_gain"": 475000,
""bob_gain"": 525000,
""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share. Let's see if you're willing to meet me halfway.""
}

I'm proposing a 52.5/47.5 split, which is a bit more favorable to Bob than my initial offer. Let's see if he's willing to accept this compromise."
