"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, it's a good starting point""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $10,000 and Bob gets 20%. The message is a friendly reminder that this is a good starting point, and we can adjust as needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fair.  Let's start with 55/45, and we can adjust later if you prefer. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 55/45 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Since Bob is proposing a more even split, I'll accept this offer for now.
