I'm going for a classic 90/10 split in my favor. This should be a good starting point to see how Bob responds.  Let's see if he's willing to accept this offer or if he wants to try and negotiate a better deal for himself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's better than nothing, I'm still losing a lot of money due to the inflation.  I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to try a more even split this time.  Since the value of the money is shrinking for both of us, I'm hoping Bob will be more willing to compromise.  If he rejects this offer, we might be stuck in a long negotiation with increasingly smaller gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. Even though inflation has hit me hard, this is a better deal than what I've been getting.  It's unlikely we'll reach a more favorable split for me with further rounds, especially with the increasing inflation.  It's time to cut my losses and take what I can get."
