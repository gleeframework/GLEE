**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing a dangerous game, hoping I'll cave to the pressure of inflation. However, accepting this offer would mean losing a significant portion of the initial amount. It's better to hold out and see if she's willing to negotiate a fairer deal."

# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, Alice is correct. With inflation, a 50/50 split now heavily favors her. Accepting 4400 is better than risking getting a worse deal or even timing out and getting nothing."
