"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you 40, it's a good starting point""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40 dollars, which is a generous starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but not that much, let's see if you'll accept 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with the offer, as I'd like to get a bit more than 30 dollars, considering the reduced value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll make a new offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I think 45 is a fair share""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 55 dollars, which is a slightly better offer than before, considering the reduced value of the money. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I think I deserve a bit more, let's see if you'll meet me in the middle 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the accelerated inflation and the reduced value of the money, I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me only 35 dollars, considering the significant reduction in value due to inflation. I'll keep pushing for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the accelerated inflation and the reduced value of the money, I'll make a new offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 50-50 is a fair split""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems like a reasonable compromise, considering the rapidly decreasing value of the money. Your turn, Bob!"
