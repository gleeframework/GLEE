"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, it's my turn to make a proposal. I'll offer her a slightly smaller share to account for the uncertainty of inflation. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 60 
# Alice gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Taking into account the inflation, Alice's offer is now worth:

For me: 60 / 0.36 = 166.67 (initially 100, but with 36% less due to inflation)
For Alice: 40 / 0.90975 = 44.05 (initially 50, but with 9.75% less due to inflation)

I think I can do better than that. I'll reject her offer.

Round 4

For Alice: 35 / 0.8145 (1 - 0.1855) = 43.01 (initially 50, but with 18.55% less due to inflation)
