"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'll reject this offer.  While it's a decent amount, it's worth seeing if I can get a better deal.  The inflation will eat into my gains if I accept too early."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think a more even split is fairer.  Let's see if we can agree on this.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll accept this offer.  I'm losing a lot of value due to inflation, and it's unlikely I'll get a significantly better deal in the next round.  This is a decent compromise."
