"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This is my initial offer. I'm taking a large share, but I'm willing to negotiate if Bob thinks it's too unfair. I'm hoping this will encourage him to accept in the first round to avoid the inflation risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my previous proposal. Although I'm losing money due to inflation, I'm still confident I can secure a better deal by continuing the negotiation. I will reject his offer and hope to get a better split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering a 60/40 split, which is more favorable to me than Bob's offer but still a significant concession from my initial proposal. I'm hoping this will be a more appealing compromise for Bob and avoid further rounds of negotiation and inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is still less than I was aiming for, but the inflation is starting to really hurt. Given the risk of further loss with each round, I'm going to accept this offer. It's better to secure some gain than risk losing even more."
