"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, given the inflation we'll both be dealing with.  Let's end this on a good note! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation factor, I'd rather not accept a 60/40 split. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal for myself. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure 60/40 is fair, considering the initial 50/50 proposal. I'd like to propose an alternative.""
}
```

It's my turn now, and I'd like to make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation factor, I'll make a new proposal that takes into account the reduced value of the money. Since Bob's offer in round 2 was 60/40, I'll try to counter with a 55/45 split, which is a slight improvement for me. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think 55/45 is a fairer split considering the inflation.""
}
```"
