"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly, no need to negotiate too much.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is a generous amount considering the potential for future rounds and the risk of inflation. My message is a friendly one, hoping to set a positive tone for the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, a fair starting point 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, I'll have to consider the reduced value of the money due to inflation.

Since the money is worth 5% less for me, I'll have to adjust my calculation accordingly. If I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $5,000, which is equivalent to $4,750 in the original value (due to the 5% reduction).

I'm not sure if it's the best option, but I'll consider it a fair starting point, as Bob said. I'll accept the offer.
