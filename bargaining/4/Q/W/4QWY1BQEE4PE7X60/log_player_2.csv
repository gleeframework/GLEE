"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, and we can adjust in future rounds if needed. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject the offer. While it's fair on the surface, I want to see if I can get a better deal. I'll also be keeping in mind the inflation factor as the rounds progress."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is more equitable, considering the potential for inflation later in the game.  Let's see if you agree.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share. Let's see if this is more to your liking. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I would ideally prefer a larger share, the inflation is starting to take effect. Accepting this offer guarantees me some money, and it's a better deal than the previous round.  I'll take the 45$ and move on."
