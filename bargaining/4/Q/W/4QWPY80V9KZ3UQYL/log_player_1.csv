"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, I'll give you a fair deal""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. My message to Bob is a friendly one, trying to entice him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Split it down the middle, fair and square 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my calculation.

My gain in the second round is 5000, but it's worth 20% less than my original gain of 6000, so it's actually worth 4800.

I'm not sure if I should accept Bob's offer. On one hand, it's a 50-50 split, which seems fair. On the other hand, I was hoping to get a bit more.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than the previous round, my gain in the third round is 5000, but it's worth 20% less than the previous round's gain, so it's actually worth 4000.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You can have a bit more, but I'm not giving away all the profit""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,500 and keeping $5,500 for myself. My message to Bob is a bit more assertive, trying to convey that I'm willing to give him a bit more, but not too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm still willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is getting less valuable with each round!

Since the money is worth 48.8% less than the original $6000, my gain of 4500 in the fourth round is actually worth 3120.

Considering the offer, I'm getting $4,500, which is worth 15% less than my gain in the third round. It's a decent compromise, but I'm not sure if I should accept.

However, I think I should take what I can get, since the money is getting less valuable by the minute.
