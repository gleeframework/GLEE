Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping to get him to accept quickly.  I know the money will be worth less to me in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll accept this offer. Even though I'm getting a lot less, it's better than getting nothing in the end."
