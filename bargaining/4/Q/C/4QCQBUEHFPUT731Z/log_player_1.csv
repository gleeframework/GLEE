"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a small amount to keep you interested!""
}
```

This way, I'm keeping 80% of the initial $10,000, which is a fair starting point, and giving Bob a small $2,000 to keep him engaged in the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly.  That way, we both get a good amount, and we can end the game quickly. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation has already taken a bite out of the money!

Considering the offer, I'm not thrilled about giving up 50% of the remaining amount, but I also don't want to prolong the game. Since the offer is fair and I'll be getting a decent amount, I'll accept it.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
