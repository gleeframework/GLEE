"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer is in your best interest considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 150000 
# Alice gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not going to accept such a low offer. With inflation not affecting me, I have the upper hand in this negotiation. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a more reasonable offer, taking into account the inflation that affects Alice. Since the money is worth 20% less to her with each passing round, she should be more inclined to accept a better offer from me sooner rather than later.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, this is a generous offer. The sooner we agree, the more your share is worth.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm feeling the inflation's bite. Let's settle this now. This is a fair deal considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 320000 
# Alice gain: 680000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI still don't think this is a good enough offer. The fact that inflation is affecting Alice's share more significantly with each round means she's under more pressure to settle than I am. I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer in the next round, trying to push for a better deal.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nLet's see what Alice does next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","With each round, Alice is losing more value due to inflation, while my potential gain remains unaffected. Given that we're now in round 4, I'll try to make an offer that still seems reasonable but tips the scales further in my favor, considering Alice's growing urgency to settle.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Inflation is taking its toll on your share. This offer is more than fair considering the current circumstances. It's wise to accept now before it devalues further.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Accept this offer now, or you'll be getting even less in the next round. Time is literally money for me! 
# Bob gain: 456000 
# Alice gain: 544000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll reject this offer. Despite Alice's urgency and the significant impact of inflation on her share, the offer still doesn't favor me as much as I believe it should, given the circumstances. I'll push for an even better deal, knowing that with each round, Alice is under more pressure due to the devaluing of her potential gain.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm aiming to maximize my gain, considering I'm in the more advantageous position."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","Given the immense pressure Alice is under due to the significant devaluation of her share (now worth 59.04% less than initially), I will make an offer that reflects the urgency of her situation. My goal is to maximize my gain while still presenting an offer that Alice might consider acceptable, given the dire circumstances she's in.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 850000, ""alice_gain"": 150000, ""message"": ""Considering the extreme devaluation of your share, this is a final, generous offer. It's in your best interest to accept now, as further negotiation will only decrease your share's value.""}"
