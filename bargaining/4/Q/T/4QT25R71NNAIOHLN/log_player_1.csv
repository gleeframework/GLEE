"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, with a message that appeals to fairness. Since Bob's money is worth 10% less each round, he has an incentive to accept my offer rather than risking a worse deal in the next round. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to split it a bit closer to even. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still not favorable to me, and I know that the inflation affects Bob's gain, not mine. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to try to get a better deal. Bring it on!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Getting closer to what I want""}\n\nI'm making a slightly more generous offer than my initial one, but still trying to take advantage of the fact that Bob's money is worth less with each passing round. Let's see if he's willing to accept this deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's just split it evenly. We both get a fair share and we can avoid further rounds of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI'm accepting Bob's offer because it's a fair split, and I've managed to get a better deal than if I had accepted his previous offers. Since my gain isn't affected by inflation, I'm getting the full value of my share, while Bob's share is worth 27.1% less than it would have been in the first round. I'm happy to end the game here and take my $5000!"
