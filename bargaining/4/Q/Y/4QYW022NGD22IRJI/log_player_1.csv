"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}

This is a 50-50 split, a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my share would be worth 20% less than the 5000 I proposed earlier, so I'd be getting 4000 in ""real"" terms.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
