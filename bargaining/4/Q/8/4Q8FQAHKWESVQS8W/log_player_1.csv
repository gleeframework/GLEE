Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better.  Let's split it more evenly. You get 45, I get 55.  It's still a fair deal for both of us, and we avoid the risk of inflation eroding our share. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55
