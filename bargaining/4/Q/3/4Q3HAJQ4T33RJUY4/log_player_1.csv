"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This offer gives me a slightly larger share, but it's also fair to Bob.  I'm hoping he'll accept, as the inflation will hurt both of us in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the offer is less than what I proposed in round 1, it is still a fair division.  I don't want to risk further inflation and getting a worse deal in the next round."
