"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 4000, and I'll take 6000. This way, we both get a decent amount.""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if he wants to propose something different!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll start with a 50/50 split. We can negotiate from here. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

Considering the 50/50 split, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject the offer. Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll be getting 5000, which is equivalent to 6000 in the original amount. This is actually a good deal for me, considering the inflation.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
