"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a very generous offer to Bob.  Since the money depreciates for me with each round, I want to secure as much as possible early on.  Let's see if he's willing to accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer to have more, Bob's offer is fair and ensures I receive a significant amount of the money.  It's a much better outcome than risking further rounds and losing more due to inflation."
