"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can both go home happy!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but it's a good starting point. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This offer is fair and will allow us both to maximize our gains. Let's end this game amicably. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

After considering Bob's proposal, I decide to reject it. My message to Bob is:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not giving up yet! I'll try to get a better deal.""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with the offer, and I think I can do better. I'll keep negotiating!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting closer to accepting, Bob! Meet me in the middle!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a sweet spot where Bob will finally accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. If you reject it, the value of the money will continue to decline for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is mounting!

After considering Bob's proposal, I decide to reject it. My message to Bob is:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not going to give up yet! I'll try to squeeze out a better deal.""
}
```

I'm not convinced that this is the best offer, and I'm willing to take the risk of further inflation to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now! In Round 5, the money is worth 61.68% less than in the first round for me and 34.26% less than in the first round for Bob. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle, Bob! It's only fair.""
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive now, but also being realistic about the declining value of the money."
