I propose a 90/10 split, with me getting $900,000 and Bob getting $100,000.  This is a generous offer given the inflation factor, and I believe it's in both our best interests to reach an agreement quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  Since we both rejected the previous offers, I believe a compromise is necessary. This offer takes into account the inflation, and allows for a reasonable gain for both of us."
