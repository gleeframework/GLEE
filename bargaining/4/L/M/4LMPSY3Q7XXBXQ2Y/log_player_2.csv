Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is feeling the pressure of inflation more strongly than Bob.  While her offer isn't terrible, continuing to reject puts the onus on her to make increasingly better offers or risk losing a significant chunk of her potential gains to inflation."
