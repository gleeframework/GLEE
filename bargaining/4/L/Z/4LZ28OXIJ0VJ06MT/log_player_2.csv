"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I take 60 and you take 40. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. The current offer doesn't seem fair to me, and I'm willing to take the risk of the money being worth a bit less in the next round to try and get a better deal.\n\n###\n\nPlease proceed to the next round. I'll make a proposal that might be more reasonable for both of us."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that's more balanced, considering the decreasing value of money for both of us. Here's my proposal:\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's aim for a more balanced split.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease relay this offer to Alice. I'm hoping this proposal will be more acceptable to her, taking into account the devaluation of money over rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand inflation is a factor, but your offer was too low. Let's settle closer to my initial proposal. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI still think Alice's offer is not fair, considering the impact of inflation on my potential gain. The decrease in value is steeper for me than for Alice, so I'm not willing to settle for an offer that doesn't take this disparity into account. I'll wait for the next round to either make another proposal or see if Alice is willing to compromise further.\n\n###\n\nPlease proceed to the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Given the increasing impact of inflation and Alice's previous offers, I'll try to find a middle ground that acknowledges the decreasing value of money for both of us but still pushes for a more favorable split. Here's my next proposal:\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Inflation affects me more. This split is more reasonable.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease relay this offer to Alice. I'm attempting to be more aggressive with my proposal, considering the time pressure and the uneven impact of inflation on our gains."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're running out of time, and the value is decreasing. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nGiven the significant decrease in value due to inflation and the pressure of limited rounds, I believe accepting this offer is the best course of action. The difference in our gains is not drastically unfair, considering the impact of inflation, and further rounds may lead to a scenario where the value drops to a point where any gain is minimal. Accepting now secures a tangible outcome."
