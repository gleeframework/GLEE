Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was quite cheeky. Let's be realistic. I'm proposing a more favorable split for me this time.  Consider the declining value of the money - accepting now is better than hoping for a miracle later. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
