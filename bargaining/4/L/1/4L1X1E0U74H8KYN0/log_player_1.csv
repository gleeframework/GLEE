"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 400k, and I'll take 600k. We can negotiate further if you'd like.""
}
```

This offer gives me a significant amount, but still leaves Bob with a substantial sum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gain being worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains being worth 10% less, I need to consider the relative values carefully.

I'm not thrilled about taking only $200,000, but I'm willing to consider it if it means getting a better deal in the future.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and hope to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more this time. I think 550k is a fair share for me, considering the initial amount.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a good share for myself and leaving Bob with enough to make it worth his while to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve more, considering the initial amount 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money Bob gains being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I need to take that into account when evaluating the offer.

Considering the significant decrease in the value of the money Bob gains, I think I can do better than this. I'll reject the offer and hope to get a better deal in the next round.
