"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. What do you say, Bob?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a slightly more even split is fair, considering the potential for inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is already affecting me!

Considering Bob's proposal, I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'd like to see if I can do better. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting Bob's offer. I'd like to proceed to Round 3 and see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is starting to bite! The money is worth 5% less than in the previous round.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. Will you accept this offer?""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent amount and not giving up too much to inflation. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
