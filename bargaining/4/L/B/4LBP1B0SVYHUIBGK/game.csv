45.0,55.0,"I think a 55/45 split is fairer, considering the next round I'll be losing 20% of my share while you only lose 10%.  Let's be reasonable and move forward.",Bob,2,

50.0,50.0,"Okay, I see your point. Let's split it evenly this time.  It's a 50/50 split, and I think it's the fairest option considering how the value is depreciating for both of us.  Let's end this game.",Alice,3,
