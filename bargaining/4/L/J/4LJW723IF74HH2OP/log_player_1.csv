"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the $10,000 and leave Bob with 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'm considering the offer. Since my gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not affected by inflation. However, Bob's gain is worth 20% less due to inflation.

Considering this, I think Bob's offer is a bit too generous, especially since I'm not getting a larger share. I'll reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Now it's my turn again. Considering the previous offers and rejections, I'll make a new proposal. Since Bob's offer was 50/50, I'll try to increase my share. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection! With the inflation rate increasing, Bob's offer is becoming more attractive. Considering that my gain is still worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gain is now worth significantly less due to the higher inflation rate, I think I should consider this offer.

However, I'm still not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll accept this offer, but I'll be keeping an eye on the next round.
