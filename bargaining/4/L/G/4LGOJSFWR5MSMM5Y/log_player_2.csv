"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split the money. This offer ensures we both benefit. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer is heavily skewed in Alice's favor. While it might seem fair at first glance, the impact of inflation means I (Bob) would lose out on potential gains over future rounds.  It's worth gambling that I can secure a better deal in subsequent rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be reasonable. This offer still gives you a significant portion, and it accounts for the time pressure and inflation we're facing. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice's offer is getting closer to a more agreeable split, but it's still not in my best interest. While she mentions ""time pressure,"" we're only on Round 3, and the inflation disparity works more and more in my favor as time goes on. I need to hold out for a better offer that reflects the changing value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6500,
""alice_gain"": 3500,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm aiming for a deal that benefits both of us, considering the inflation's effect is becoming more pronounced with each round that passes. This offer reflects that reality.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  Let's just split it evenly and call it a day.  Every round that passes hurts us both. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice is right, this is getting ridiculous. While a 50/50 split wasn't ideal in the beginning,  the impact of inflation on her share is becoming substantial. Accepting this offer guarantees me a reasonable amount and avoids the risk of walking away with nothing if we continue to the bitter end."
