"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money 4:1, I'll get the larger share. It's a fair start!""
}
```

This way, I'll get $8,000, and Bob will get $2,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this generous offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fairer. Let's try 55/45, and see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is already taking a toll on my potential gains!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to reject it. I'd rather not accept a 45% share, as I'd like to get a slightly larger share to account for the inflation. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation taking a 5% bite, the money is worth even less now. Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share due to the initial generosity of my offer. Let's see if you agree!""
}
```

This way, I'll get $6,000, and Bob will get $4,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this compromise!"
