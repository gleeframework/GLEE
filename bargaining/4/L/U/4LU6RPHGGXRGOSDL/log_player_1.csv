I'm going to start with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly.  This way, we both get something and I maximize my share before the inflation hits!"

Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm offering Bob a 35% share, which is a significant increase from his last offer.  This is likely my best chance to get a deal before the inflation makes my share even smaller. I'm willing to accept a slightly lower share than what I initially wanted to secure a deal before it's too late."
