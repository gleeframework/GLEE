Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I deserve a bit more, don't you? 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation hasn't affected me, I think I deserve a bigger share now. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is getting greedier and taking advantage of the situation. While it stings to lose money to inflation, accepting a deal where I get significantly less than him sets a bad precedent. I'm hoping he'll become more reasonable in the next few rounds."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Let's just split it down the middle and be done with it. I'm losing money with every passing round!""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the increasing inflation impact on your share, I'm willing to take a larger portion. It's time to decide, Alice. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  This is a tough decision, but with the inflation eating away at my share, I'm getting dangerously close to a point where accepting a bad deal is better than getting nothing. Bob is clearly exploiting the situation, but rejecting this offer means I risk walking away with even less in future rounds. It's a bitter pill to swallow, but I need to cut my losses."
