"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000
}

I'm offering you $1,000, and I'll get the remaining $9,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 10% less, so I'll be getting $9,000 x 0.9 = $8,100.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
