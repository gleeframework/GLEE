Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fairer, considering the inflation factor. It's a good deal for both of us, and we can end this game right here. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000
