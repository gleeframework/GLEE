**Reasoning:**

While the inflation is hitting Bob harder, waiting him out might not be the best strategy anymore.  The value of the money is decreasing significantly with each round.  I'll reject this offer in hopes of getting a slightly better deal in Round 5, but I need to be prepared to accept a less favorable offer than I'd like due to the shrinking pot."
