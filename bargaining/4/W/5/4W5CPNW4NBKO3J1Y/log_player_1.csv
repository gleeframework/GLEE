"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

I propose a 99.9% share for myself, and a $1,000 share for Bob.  It's a very fair deal, considering I'm the one proposing! ðŸ˜‰"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While it's not the ideal split, it's better than getting nothing in 12 rounds. Inflation is a serious threat, and it's better to secure something now."
