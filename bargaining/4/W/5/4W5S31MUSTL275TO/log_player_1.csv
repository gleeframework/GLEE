"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money more evenly. This way, we both get a reasonable share, and we can avoid the potential for further losses due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{
