Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI'll take 55 dollars and Bob will get 45 dollars. I've included a message to Bob suggesting that this is a fair division, with me taking a bit more. Let's see if he accepts!"

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be real, Alice. This is a negotiation. I'll take the same amount you offered me, but reversed. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer for now. Since we're in the early rounds, I'm willing to take a risk and see if I can get a better deal later on. Besides, I don't want to give up too easily! Let's proceed to the next round and see what happens."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle""}\n\nIn this round, I'll offer a compromise, taking 52 dollars and giving Bob 48 dollars.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Okay Alice, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both benefit before inflation eats away at the value. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll accept Bob's offer this time. With inflation eating away at the value, a 50/50 split seems like a fair deal, and it's better to secure this amount now rather than risking further losses in future rounds. Let's shake on it and end the game here!
