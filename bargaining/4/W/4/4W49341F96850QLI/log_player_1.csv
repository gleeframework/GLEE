I'm starting with a fairly aggressive offer, aiming for a large share of the money.  Let's see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is better than nothing, but I'm still holding out for a larger share.  I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7500, ""bob_gain"": 2500}
```

I'm increasing my share slightly, but I'm still trying to leave Bob with a decent amount.  I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to compromise, while still pursuing a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a fair offer and a good compromise.  We're both getting a significant share of the money, and there's no point in risking getting nothing by continuing to reject offers."
