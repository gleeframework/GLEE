I propose a 90/10 split, with me getting $9,000 and Bob getting $1,000.  I think this is a fair starting point, as I'm taking on the risk of the offer being rejected."

This is still a pretty lopsided deal, and I'm not sure how much inflation Bob is facing, but I'm willing to see if I can get a better offer."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

Bob's offer is still pretty lopsided.  I'm going to keep trying to get a better deal.  I'm hoping that the inflation is affecting him more than it is me, and he'll be more willing to negotiate as we get closer to the deadline."

Round 5

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7500, ""bob_gain"": 2500}

I'm going to propose a slightly more even split again, trying to find a middle ground. I'm hoping that with the inflation pressure mounting, Bob will be more inclined to accept a deal closer to 50/50."

{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While the offer is getting closer to 50/50, it's still heavily in Bob's favor.  The inflation is becoming a bigger problem, but I'm not willing to settle for a deal that's so lopsided.  I'm going to keep trying to negotiate a more even split."

Bob's offer is getting more and more favorable to him.  However, I'm still not willing to settle for such a lopsided deal, especially with the inflation rate.  I'm going to keep trying to negotiate a more even split.  There's still a few rounds left, and I'm hoping that Bob will realize that we both need to come to an agreement soon to avoid losing everything."

Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500}
```

We are getting very close to the deadline and the inflation is really starting to hit. I'm going to propose a slightly more even split again, conceding a little more to try and get a deal done.  I'm hoping Bob realizes that time is running out and we both need to make a compromise to avoid getting nothing."
