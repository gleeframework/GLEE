Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, this is the best I can do 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Reasoning:

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in Round 3 is the most logical choice for Bob. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:** The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, especially for Alice. This means her negotiating position weakens with each round. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Waiting for a better offer in later rounds is risky. The slight potential gain for Bob is likely outweighed by the devaluation of the money.
* **Certainty vs. Risk:** Accepting now guarantees Bob a reasonable share. Rejecting means risking an even lower offer from Alice in a future round, where the money is worth considerably less."
