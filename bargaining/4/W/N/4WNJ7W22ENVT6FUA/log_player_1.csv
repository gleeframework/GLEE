I'm going to propose a 60/40 split in my favor, as I think this is a fair starting point.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, given the inflation and the fact that Bob is offering me a decent amount, I'll accept his offer.  It's better to secure something than risk getting nothing in the next round."
