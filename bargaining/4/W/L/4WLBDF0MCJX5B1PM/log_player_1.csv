Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept this offer. I was hoping for a more balanced split, and Bob's proposal is still too skewed in his favor. I'll wait for the next round to make a new proposal."

I think this is a fair 50-50 split, and considering the decreasing value of the money, I'm willing to accept this offer. It's not the best deal I could have gotten, but I think it's a reasonable compromise given the circumstances."
