I'm proposing to keep the majority of the money, giving Bob a small amount to hopefully incentivize him to accept the offer. I'm aiming for a quick win, but also considering the possibility of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is essentially the same as mine, but flipped.  I'm not going to accept an offer that gives me so little, especially since I'm now facing inflation. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm raising my offer slightly, but still keeping the majority of the money.  I'm trying to find a balance between getting a good deal and ensuring the game doesn't drag on too long.  With each round, the inflation will make my offer less appealing, so I need to find a compromise soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'm still losing money due to inflation, this offer is much better than what I've been getting from Bob. Accepting this means I get a decent amount and we both get equal shares. It's a good compromise to avoid the game dragging on further and potentially ending with us getting nothing."
