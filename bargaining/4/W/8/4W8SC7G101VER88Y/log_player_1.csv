"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent amount, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 5% inflation, the money I gain is now worth $950,000, which is less than what I initially proposed.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled with the 2:8 ratio, but I'm willing to compromise. Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the $200,000, which is better than nothing, and hope that Bob is happy with his $800,000."
