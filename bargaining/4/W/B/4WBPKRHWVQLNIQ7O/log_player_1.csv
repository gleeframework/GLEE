I'm going for a slightly uneven split in my favor. I think it's a fair offer, considering I'm the one making the first proposal. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob is being greedy! I'm not going to accept that. Let's see if he'll be more reasonable in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

I'm going for a more balanced approach this time.  I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I should get a slightly bigger share since I'm the one making the offer."
