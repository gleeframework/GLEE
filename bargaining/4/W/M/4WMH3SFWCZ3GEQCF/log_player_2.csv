"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I take a bit more considering the inflation rate affects me more. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While Alice's offer is ""reasonable"" on the surface, it's important to consider the inflation rates.  I'm willing to take a smaller share now, hoping to get a better deal in later rounds as the inflation hits Alice harder."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to split the money more evenly, but given the inflation rates, I need a bit more than your initial offer. Let's work towards a fair solution.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the inflation affects you too, Bob. This offer is a compromise, slightly better for me than your last. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While Alice's offer is a compromise, it's still not quite fair given the current inflation rates.  I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round when I have the opportunity to make the offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4700, ""alice_gain"": 5300, ""message"": ""With each round, inflation is making it harder for both of us.  I'm offering a split closer to 50/50 to ensure we both get something valuable.  Let's agree and move on before it's too late.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time, and inflation is eating our potential gains. This is my final offer, a small increase for me from yours. Let's be practical and secure something. 
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a more even split, Alice's offer is a reasonable compromise given the dwindling time and increasing inflation. It's better to secure something now than risk getting nothing at all."
