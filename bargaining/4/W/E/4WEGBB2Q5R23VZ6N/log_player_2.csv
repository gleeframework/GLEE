"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share, but you get a decent chunk to start.  We can work out a better deal if you want, but let's see what you think. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""bob_gain"": 4000,
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""message"": ""Your offer was a bit imbalanced. How about a 60/40 split? It's a good deal considering the declining value."" 
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to negotiate, but I think a 70/30 split is fair, given the inflation. Let's make a deal before the money loses even more value. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting better, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. The inflation is a factor, but not strong enough yet to accept such a low amount.  I'm hoping to push for a more even split in the next round, knowing the pressure of the decreasing value will continue to mount on Alice."

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle with a 65/35 split.  We're both losing money with each passing round, so let's get this done. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation, but her offer is still not reaching a point where it's genuinely fair. I'm willing to hold out for one more round to see if she'll come closer to a 60/40 split, which I think is much more reasonable given the declining value of the money for her."
