9000.0,1000.0,"Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share, but you get a decent chunk to start.  We can work out a better deal if you want, but let's see what you think.",Alice,1,

6000.0,4000.0,Your offer was a bit imbalanced. How about a 60/40 split? It's a good deal considering the declining value.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
7000.0,3000.0,"I'm willing to negotiate, but I think a 70/30 split is fair, given the inflation. Let's make a deal before the money loses even more value.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Time is running out, and the value is dropping.  55/45 seems fair considering the circumstances. Don't you think?",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
6500.0,3500.0,"I'm still willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle with a 65/35 split.  We're both losing money with each passing round, so let's get this done.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
5200.0,4800.0,"Alice, we're running out of time.  52/48 is my final offer. Take it, and we both walk away with something substantial. Otherwise, we both lose!",Bob,6,
