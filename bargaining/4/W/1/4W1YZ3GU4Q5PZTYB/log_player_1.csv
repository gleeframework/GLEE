"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives Alice 90% of the money, leaving 10% for Bob. It's a very unbalanced offer, but it's a starting point. Since the money is worth less in each round, Alice wants to secure as much as possible early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While this offer is significantly better than the previous round's offer, it still seems unfair. Alice can likely get a better deal by rejecting and proposing in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

Alice is now in a stronger position to negotiate. The money is worth less for both players, but Bob lost more value this round. This offer keeps the split more even, while still giving Alice a larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This offer is getting closer to a 50/50 split, and considering the significant inflation, accepting is a good move.  Alice is likely to get a worse deal if the game continues."
