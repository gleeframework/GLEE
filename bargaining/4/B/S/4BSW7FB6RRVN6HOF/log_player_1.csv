"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the original $1,000,000, which is $400,000. I'll take the remaining 60%, which is $600,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, the $600,000 I was initially aiming for is now worth $480,000.

Bob's offer is $250,000, which is worth $250,000, and he's offering me $750,000, which is worth $750,000.

I'll accept this offer since it's a more even split and I'll get a decent amount of money, even with the inflation factor.
