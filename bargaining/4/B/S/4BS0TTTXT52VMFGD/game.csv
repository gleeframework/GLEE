40.0,60.0,"I think we can do better than that. Let's split it 60/40, with me taking the larger share this time. It's a fair deal, considering I rejected your offer and we are now losing money with each passing round.",Bob,2,

55.0,45.0,"Bob, let's be reasonable. I understand you want a larger share, but taking turns being greedy will cost us both. I'm offering you 45% - it's more than you would've gotten last round.  Let's close this deal before inflation eats away at our potential gains.",Alice,3,
