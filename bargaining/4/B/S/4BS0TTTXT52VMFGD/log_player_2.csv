Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable. I understand you want a larger share, but taking turns being greedy will cost us both. I'm offering you 45% - it's more than you would've gotten last round.  Let's close this deal before inflation eats away at our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
