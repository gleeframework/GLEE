"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a fair split, but I'm going to take advantage of the inflation. 65/35 in my favor is still a reasonable offer, considering the value is decreasing for both of us. I'm willing to negotiate further, but only if you accept. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
