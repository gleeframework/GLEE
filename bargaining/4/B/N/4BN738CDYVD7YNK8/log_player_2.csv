"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is the same deal you offered me last round, but now it's even worse for you because of inflation. Let's be reasonable and end this. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

Alice is right. Due to inflation, the deal I offered in Round 2 is now worse for me. Accepting a 45/55 split now is better than risking getting even less in future rounds."
