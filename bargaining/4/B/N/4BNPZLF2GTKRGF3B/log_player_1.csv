"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with the 20-80 split. I was hoping for a more equal distribution. I'll reject this offer and make a new one."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my new offer:
