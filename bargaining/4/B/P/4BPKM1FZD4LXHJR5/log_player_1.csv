Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're too generous, I'll take more this time 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since Bob's gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, and I'm gaining $4000, which is worth the same as in the first round, this offer seems less favorable to me than the initial one.
