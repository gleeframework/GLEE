"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This gives us both a little less than half to account for the time value of money.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 525000,
""alice_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""I understand about the time value of money, Alice, but I think it's fairer if we switch amounts from your last offer. This way, I'm slightly incentivized to close the deal now, and you still get a good deal considering the inflation working against you.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's be realistic.  A 50/50 split is the fairest and fastest way to settle this.  Every round that passes hurts us both in the long run. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

Alice is right. While I could try to squeeze out a little more, the longer this goes on, the less her offers will be worth to her, making it harder to reach a deal where I get more than 50%. Accepting now guarantees a decent outcome."
