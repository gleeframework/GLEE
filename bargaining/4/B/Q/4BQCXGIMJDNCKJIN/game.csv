50.0,50.0,"Let's split it evenly. We both want to get as much as we can, but the inflation is only affecting me, so I think 50/50 is a fair compromise.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"I understand the inflation is impacting you more, but I still need a bit more. Let's do 55/45.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
48.0,52.0,"Considering the impact of inflation on me, I'm willing to compromise a bit more. I'll take 52% and you can have 48%. This way, we both get a decent share, and I'll try to minimize my losses due to inflation.",Bob,4,

53.0,47.0,"Bob, we're running out of time.  55/45 is really my limit, but I'll compromise to 53/47.  Take it or leave it - we both lose if this goes on.",Alice,5,
