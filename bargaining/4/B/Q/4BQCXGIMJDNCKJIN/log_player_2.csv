"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60/40. This seems fair since we both lose money if we wait too long. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better offer. The 10% inflation rate for me is a significant concern, but I'm willing to take the risk for now. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly. We both want to get as much as we can, but the inflation is only affecting me, so I think 50/50 is a fair compromise.""}\n\n###\n\nI'm hoping Alice will see the fairness in this offer and accept it before the inflation takes a bigger toll on my potential gain."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the inflation is impacting you more, but I still need a bit more. Let's do 55/45. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlthough the inflation is taking a bigger toll on my potential gain, I still believe I can negotiate for a better deal. Alice is not affected by the inflation, so she has less incentive to rush into an agreement. I'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a more favorable offer. The difference between 45% and 50% is still significant to me, considering the decreasing value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Considering the impact of inflation on me, I'm willing to compromise a bit more. I'll take 52% and you can have 48%. This way, we both get a decent share, and I'll try to minimize my losses due to inflation.""}\n\n###\n\nI'm trying to find a middle ground that takes into account the inflation affecting me, while still being reasonable for Alice. Hopefully, she'll see this as a fair offer and accept it before the inflation worsens."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time.  55/45 is really my limit, but I'll compromise to 53/47.  Take it or leave it - we both lose if this goes on. 
# Bob gain: 47 
# Alice gain: 53 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the rapidly decreasing value of the money for me due to inflation, I think it's wise to accept Alice's offer at this point. The difference between what I wanted and what she's offering is becoming less significant as the rounds go on and the money loses more value. If I wait any longer, I risk losing even more to inflation, and potentially ending up with nothing if we can't agree within the 12 rounds. Alice's offer of 47% is reasonable given the circumstances, and I'll take it to minimize further losses."
