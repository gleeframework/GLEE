"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide it fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI'll offer Bob $400,000 and keep $600,000 for myself. I think this is a reasonable proposal since I'm taking on more risk by going first. If Bob rejects, the value of the money will decrease, and we'll both end up with less. Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the value of the money has decreased due to inflation, Bob's offer of $450,000 for me is actually worth less than it would have been in the first round. Considering this, I think I can do better. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a new proposal in the next round.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nConsidering the decreasing value of money, I'll make a slightly more conservative offer this time. I'll propose that I take $580,000 and Bob takes $420,000. Since the value of money has decreased, this offer is actually worth less than my initial proposal, but I'm hoping Bob will see it as a more reasonable compromise.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer, let's close this deal. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the value of money decreasing rapidly, I need to consider the risks of holding out for a better deal. Since Bob claims this is his final offer, I'm inclined to believe he won't budge further. The difference between our proposed gains is relatively small, and I'd rather secure a deal now than risk losing more value to inflation. I'll accept Bob's offer.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nLet's close the deal!"
