Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This is a pretty aggressive offer, but since it's the first round, it's worth trying to secure a large share of the money. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more money, this offer is still decent considering inflation. It's much better than the 10% loss I'd face by rejecting and going to the next round."
