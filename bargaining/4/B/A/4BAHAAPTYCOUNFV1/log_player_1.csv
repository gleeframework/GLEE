Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair!""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a 60-40 split in my favor, with a friendly message to Bob, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly. Your turn!"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fair, given the value of money changes each round. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince Bob's offer gives me only $40, and considering that the value of money remains the same for me, I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nSince Bob's offer was too low for me, I'll try to make a more reasonable offer, taking into account that the money is worth 20% less for Bob in each round.
