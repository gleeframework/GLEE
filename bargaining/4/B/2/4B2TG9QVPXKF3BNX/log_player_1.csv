"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose taking 90% of the money, leaving 10% for Bob. This is a fair starting point, as it allows for negotiation in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm willing to decrease my share by 10% to try and reach an agreement.  This offer is still fair, as it acknowledges that Bob's offer in the previous round was too extreme."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'll reject this offer again.  While Bob is increasing his share, the value of the money I receive continues to decline due to inflation. I need to secure a better share for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm reducing my share again to try and get a deal done. I'm now proposing a 60/40 split, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is increasing his share while the value of my money keeps decreasing.  I'll reject again and see if we can reach a better compromise in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

With inflation getting worse, I'm proposing an even split. This is a fair compromise considering the circumstances, and it might finally convince Bob to accept."
