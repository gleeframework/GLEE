"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This gives you a fair amount upfront, and we don't risk losing everything to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 50000 
# Alice gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting this offer.  While it's tempting to take something now, I think I can do better by seeing what Alice will offer in the next round. With inflation hitting her harder, she might be more inclined to give me a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 900000,
""alice_gain"": 100000,
""message"": ""I'm offering you a smaller share, but it's a good start. Inflation will hurt you more than me, so let's get this settled before it's too late.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be serious.  My offer in Round 1 was more than fair.  This is me being generous, but the clock is ticking. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is an improvement from her first proposal, but I'm still not convinced. The inflation will continue to hurt her more than me, and I believe I can still get a better deal. I'm going to keep pushing for a higher share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 900000,
""alice_gain"": 100000,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm sticking with my previous offer. It's a fair deal considering the inflation that is impacting you more. We need to make a decision soon before we both lose out."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm compromising again, but this is the last time.  Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 150000 
# Alice gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

Alice has significantly reduced her offer, and I believe that the inflation is going to affect her much more in the next few rounds.  It's time to take what I can get before the value completely drops."
