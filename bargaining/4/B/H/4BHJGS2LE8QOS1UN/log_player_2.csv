Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's offer was 40-60, I'll try to counter with a more favorable ratio for myself. Here's my offer:

# Alice gain: 55

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Inflation is eating away at the value of the money, so I need to be more aggressive in my offer. I'll try to get a better deal for myself. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing rapidly! I'll need to think carefully about this offer. A 50-50 split is a fair offer, but considering the inflation, it's actually a relatively good deal for me. I'll accept this offer to avoid further erosion of the money's value.
