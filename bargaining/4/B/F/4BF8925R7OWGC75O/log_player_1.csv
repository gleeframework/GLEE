Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: That's not a great start, Alice. How about we try something more reasonable? This is a 60/40 split in my favor - take it before inflation eats away at your share! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000
