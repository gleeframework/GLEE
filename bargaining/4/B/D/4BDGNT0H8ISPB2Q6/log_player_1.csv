Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very generous offer to Bob. I want to see if he's willing to accept a small share to secure the money now, or if he's going to try to negotiate for more later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob is clearly trying to exploit the inflation and take most of the money.  I'm going to reject this offer and see if he'll become more reasonable in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm going to reduce my offer to Bob a bit, but still offer him a significant share. I'm hoping to demonstrate that I'm willing to compromise, but also that I'm not going to be bullied.  The inflation is starting to hurt, but I'm still hoping to secure a decent share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still trying to take the lion's share, despite the inflation making his offer less valuable.  I'm going to reject it again. I'm starting to feel the pressure of the inflation, but I won't give in until I get a more fair offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

The inflation is really starting to bite, but I still think I can get a decent share. I'm reducing my offer further, but still offering Bob more than half the money. I'm hoping this shows him that I'm serious about negotiating, and that I'm not going to accept a deal that's grossly unfair."
