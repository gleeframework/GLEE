I'm proposing a 60/40 split, with me receiving $600,000 and Bob receiving $400,000.  I'm hoping this is more appealing to Bob considering the increasing inflation."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}

While the offer isn't ideal, the inflation is a huge factor at this point. Accepting ensures some gain for me, while rejecting risks getting nothing."
