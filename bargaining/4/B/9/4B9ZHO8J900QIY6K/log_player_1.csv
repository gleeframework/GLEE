"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, fair and square?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can't have all the fun, let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, looks like I didn't get a good deal in Round 1!

Considering the inflation, I'll have to think carefully about Bob's new offer. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, $10 is equivalent to $8 in the original amount. That's a pretty low offer!

I'll decide to reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Time to make a new offer!

Considering the inflation, I'll try to make a more balanced offer. I'll offer Bob a slightly higher share, but still keep a significant portion for myself.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's make a deal!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting close, but I'm not giving up yet! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, another rejection!

Considering the inflation, I'll calculate the equivalent amounts in the original $100:

My gain: $30 is equivalent to $15.38 in the original amount (due to 48.8% inflation)
Bob's gain: $70 is equivalent to $50.71 in the original amount (due to 27.1% inflation)

This offer is still quite skewed in Bob's favor, but I'll have to consider the fact that the money is worth less with each passing round. I'll decide to reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Time to make another offer!

Considering the inflation, I'll try to be more aggressive this time. I'll offer a slightly higher share to Bob, but still keep a decent amount for myself.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""Getting serious now, let's make a deal!""
}
```"
