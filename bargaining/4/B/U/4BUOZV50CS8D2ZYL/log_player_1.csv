"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take $8,000 and you get $2,000. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair.  Let's start the negotiation here, and see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 5% less, my gain of $4,000 is now worth $3,800.

I'm not thrilled with the 60-40 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I like the 60-40 split. Can you consider a 55-45 split?""
}
```

I'm trying to nudge the split a bit more in my favor, while still being open to negotiation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 5% less again, my gain of $3,800 is now worth $3,610.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. How about a 55.5-44.5 split?""
}
```

I'm trying to inch my way closer to a favorable split, while still being reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle.  I'll take 5500 and you take 4500.  This is a good compromise, and we can avoid further rounds of negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is catching up!

With the money worth 14.26% less, my gain of $3,610 is now worth $3,101.41.

I'm not thrilled with the 55-45 split, but I think Bob's offer is a good compromise. I'd rather not risk going further into debt with more rounds of negotiation. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, let's meet in the middle. I'll take $4,500 and you get $5,500. It's a fair deal.""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer, and we can finally divide the money!"
