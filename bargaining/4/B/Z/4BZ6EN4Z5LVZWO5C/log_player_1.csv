"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a significant amount, but I'm also keeping a larger share for myself, as I'm the one making the first offer. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split things a bit more evenly to get this money quickly. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:


{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""
}


I've increased Bob's share slightly, but I'm still taking a larger portion for myself. Since Bob's money is worth 10% less now due to inflation, I'm hoping he'll be more willing to accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is money Alice! This is as close to the middle as we'll get. 
# Alice gain: 487500 
# Bob gain: 512500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 575000,
  ""bob_gain"": 425000,
  ""message"": ""You're losing value, I'm not""
}


Since Bob's money is worth less and less with each round, I'm increasing the pressure by offering him a smaller share. I'm hoping he'll realize that it's better to accept this offer rather than risk losing even more value in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is ridiculous, Alice. Let's just split it evenly and end this charade. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 587500,
  ""bob_gain"": 412500,
  ""message"": ""You should have accepted earlier""
}


At this point, Bob's money is worth significantly less than it was initially, and I'm taking advantage of that by offering him an even smaller share. I'm hoping he'll finally cave in and accept this offer, since he's losing more and more value with each passing round."
