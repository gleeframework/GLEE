# Bob gain: 412500 
# Alice gain: 587500

This is a tough one, but I have to accept.  The longer this goes on, the more I lose to inflation.  Alice is clearly content to let this happen. While 412500 is much less than I wanted, it's better than accepting an even worse deal in a later round, or getting nothing at all."
