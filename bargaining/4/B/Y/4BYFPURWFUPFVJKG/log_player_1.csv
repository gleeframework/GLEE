"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start with. It's a fair and simple proposal.""}

I'm proposing to split the $10,000 evenly between us, with each of us getting $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve a bit more since I'm the one making the proposal this round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's proposal, but I'm willing to consider it. Since the money is worth 10% less for me this round, I'm not as concerned about the absolute numbers as I was in the first round.

I'll decide to {""decision"": ""accept""} this offer, hoping to negotiate further in future rounds."
