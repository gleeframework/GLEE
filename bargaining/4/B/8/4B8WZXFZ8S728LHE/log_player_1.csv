"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}

I'm offering a 50-50 split, which seems fair to me!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about it...

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'm not willing to accept a 40-60 split. I'd like to keep negotiating!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new proposal. Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll aim for a slightly higher percentage for myself.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55
}

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
