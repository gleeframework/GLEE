Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This is my initial offer. I believe it is a fair split, considering the potential for inflation in future rounds."

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I am increasing my share slightly to compensate for the inflation. I believe this is still a fair offer, given that Bob's money is losing value at a faster rate than mine."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000

While I would have preferred to get more, the inflation is severely impacting Bob's share, making this a more fair split considering the circumstances."
