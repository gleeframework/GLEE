"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'm willing to give you a decent share!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. This is a relatively fair split, considering the initial amount of $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm not being too generous yet 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll have to reassess the offer.

Considering the reduced value of the money, I think I can do better than 40/60 split. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth 20% less for me, so I'll have to be more aggressive in my proposal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm not budging much!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $7,000 and Bob gets $3,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think this is a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money. With the money being worth 48.8% less for me and 14.26% less for Bob, I think I have to be careful not to accept an offer that's too low.

However, a 50/50 split is a fair compromise, and it's better than what I would get if I were to reject the offer and proceed to the next round. I'll accept this offer.
