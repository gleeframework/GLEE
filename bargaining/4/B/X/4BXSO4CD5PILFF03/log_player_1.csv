"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 
I'll propose a 900,000/100,000 split in my favor. This seems like a fair starting point, giving Bob a significant share while still leaving me with the majority.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to take something rather than nothing, this is a 90/10 split in Bob's favor.  I'm not going to accept such a lopsided deal this early in the game. There are still plenty of rounds left."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I'll propose a slightly more even split: 850,000 for me and 150,000 for Bob.  It's still a majority for me, but  it acknowledges that Bob has some leverage now.  Hopefully, this is fair enough to get us closer to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting close to the end,  the 80/20 split is still too lopsided in his favor.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to get a more substantial share than that."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm offering a 700,000/300,000 split.  The inflation is starting to really bite, so I need to secure a larger share to make this worthwhile. I'm hopeful that Bob will see this as a fair compromise, given the dwindling value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer.  While the game is getting more serious, I'm not willing to accept a 70/30 split in his favor. I'm still confident that we can find a more balanced agreement."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering a 600,000/400,000 split.  The inflation is really hurting now, so I need to secure a substantial amount to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to compromise further, but  I need to get a significant share of the money.  Hopefully, Bob will recognize the need for a more even split at this point."
