"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's split the money evenly to ensure a fair outcome. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nSince the offer is to split the money evenly, which is the most fair outcome, I see no reason to reject it. Accepting ensures both of us get an equal share without risking getting less or nothing in subsequent rounds."
