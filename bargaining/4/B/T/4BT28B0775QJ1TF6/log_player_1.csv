"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. We can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial 100$ and leaving 40% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure why you started with an unfair offer. Let's meet in the middle this time. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less now, my gain of 50$ is actually worth 47.5$ (100 * 0.95 * 0.5).

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
