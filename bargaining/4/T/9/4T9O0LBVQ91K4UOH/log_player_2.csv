Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire for a larger share, but let's be realistic.  The money is worth less with each passing round.  A 50/50 split is the fairest and most efficient way to move forward.  Let's avoid any further delays and finalize this. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000
