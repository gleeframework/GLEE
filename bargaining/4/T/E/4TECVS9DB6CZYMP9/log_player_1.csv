"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering a 50-50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is already affecting the value of the money!

I'm not convinced that 4000 is a good deal for me, considering the inflation. I'd like to try to get a better share.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to Bob. Since the money is worth 10% less now, I'll aim to get a larger share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting away with the majority! I want a bigger share.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting greedy, but I'll give you a bit more 
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value! I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, considering the inflation. However, I'm not getting any younger, and I don't want to risk going home with nothing.

I'll think about it...
