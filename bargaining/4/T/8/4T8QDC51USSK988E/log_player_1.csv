"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""}

I'm offering Bob 40 dollars, which is 40% of the original 100 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to be more balanced, but I'm willing to give you a bit more 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not satisfied with the offer. I was hoping for a more equal split, and 70/30 is still quite skewed in Bob's favor. I'd like to make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, let's try 55/45""}

I'm offering Bob 45 dollars, which is a slight improvement from his previous offer, and hoping that he will accept this more balanced split."
