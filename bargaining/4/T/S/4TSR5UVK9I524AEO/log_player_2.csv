Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm not going to accept this offer. It's a good starting point, but I'm confident I can get a better deal.  I'll see what Alice offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's split it closer to even. I'm willing to give you a little more than half.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle of our previous offers 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I would prefer a more even split, I don't want to risk losing everything due to inflation. This offer is a decent compromise, and I'm willing to accept it."
