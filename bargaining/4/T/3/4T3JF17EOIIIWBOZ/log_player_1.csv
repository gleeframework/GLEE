Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a very generous offer to Bob.  I want to see if he's willing to accept a small share, or if he's going to try to get more.  I know there's inflation, but I want to see if I can secure a large share early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred a larger share, accepting this offer ensures that I get a significant amount of money.  Given the inflation, holding out for more could be risky. It's better to secure half now than to risk losing a larger share later."
