I'm Bob and I'm going to try to get a better deal than 10 dollars!  Let's see what I can do in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}
```

I propose we split the money 60/40.  It's a fair deal for both of us, and hopefully, Alice will see that."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd like to hold out for more, the inflation is starting to hurt. 40 dollars is better than nothing, and I'm not sure I can get a better deal in the next round."
