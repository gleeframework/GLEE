Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a larger share to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is compromising, the deal is still significantly better for her. The inflation is also working in my favor. It's risky, but I'll hold out for a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Alice, time is running out and the pot is shrinking. This is my final offer - let's be fair and end this now.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  With each round, the value decreases significantly. A decent deal now is better than risking nothing later.
* **Firm Stance:**  By calling it my ""final offer,"" I'm hoping to signal that I'm serious and won't accept anything less favorable.
* **Slight Edge:** I'm still asking for a slight majority, acknowledging that Alice is also losing value, but making it clear I want a reasonable advantage."
