Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55/45 split in my favor.  It's still a fair offer considering the money is decreasing in value for me. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{
