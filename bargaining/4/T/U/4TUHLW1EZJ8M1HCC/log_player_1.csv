"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, as I'm giving Bob a significant portion of the money. Let's see if he accepts!"

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 10% less for Bob, his offer is even more generous than it initially seems. However, I'd like to try to get a better deal for myself.

```

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer was 55% for him and 45% for me, I'll try to counter with an offer that gives me a slightly larger share. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"

# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on Bob's offer! With the money he's offering me worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'll try to take advantage of the situation. However, I don't want to give up too much, so I'll try to negotiate.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 65,
  ""bob_gain"": 35
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
