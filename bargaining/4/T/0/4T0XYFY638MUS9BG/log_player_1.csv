Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're running out of time, the money is losing value for you... 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While the offer is not ideal, I'm losing money with each round, and it's better to accept something than risk getting nothing."
