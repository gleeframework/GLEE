"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Alice's offer was 70% of the money, I'll try to counter with an offer that's slightly less, to give myself a slight edge. However, I also need to consider the inflation factor, which reduces the money's value over time.

Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 320000, ""alice_gain"": 680000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation factor, Alice's offer seems reasonable. However, I still want to try to get a better deal.

Since the money is worth less with each passing round, I'll try to get a bit more in this round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation factor, I'll aim for a higher percentage of the remaining money. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 420000, ""alice_gain"": 580000}"
