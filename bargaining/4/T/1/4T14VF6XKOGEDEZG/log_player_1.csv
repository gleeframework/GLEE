"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 

I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor.  It's a good starting point, but I'm willing to negotiate if Bob rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm not happy with this offer. I know I'm losing value due to inflation, but 80/20 is still too lopsided in Bob's favor. I'm willing to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I'm proposing a 85/15 split.  This reflects the inflation and shows I'm willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still not satisfied with this offer. While I'm losing a lot due to inflation, I won't accept another lopsided split. I need to see a more even distribution."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm proposing a 70/30 split. This is a significant concession considering the inflation, but I need to secure a reasonable share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 65 
# Bob gain: 35 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the inflation is hitting me hard, I need to accept this offer. It's the closest to a 50/50 split I've seen, and with the remaining rounds, the value of my share will only decrease further."
