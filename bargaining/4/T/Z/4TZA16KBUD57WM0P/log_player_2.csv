"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. Let's get this done quickly! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

It's a good deal for Alice, but I can probably do better!  I'll see if I can get a bigger share in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, Alice. This way we both get a fair share and we can move on.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob. This offer still favors me, but I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a more even split, the inflation is starting to hurt.  This offer is better than what I can expect in the next round, so I'll take it."
