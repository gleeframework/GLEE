"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is a fair deal, considering the inflation. You get a small piece now, and I get the majority. Let's end this quickly. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While Alice's message tries to frame the offer as fair, it's heavily skewed in her favor.  It's only round 1, and I'm willing to see what kind of offer I can get in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly. This way, we both get a fair share before inflation eats away at our gains.""}
