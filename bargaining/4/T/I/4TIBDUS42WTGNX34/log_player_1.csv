"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

This is a pretty aggressive opening offer, aiming for 90% of the money.  Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a fair offer and I'm not sure how much more I can gain in future rounds with the inflation penalty.  Accepting is the safest option."
