"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the 100$ and Bob gets 20%. This is a relatively fair split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of 60$ is actually worth 54$ (since 60 * 0.9 = 54).

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but it's a reasonable compromise. I'll accept it.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
