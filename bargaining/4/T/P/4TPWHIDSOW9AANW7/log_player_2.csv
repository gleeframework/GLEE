"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 50/50, a fair start! 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer.  While it seems fair on the surface, I know inflation is a factor. I'm going to try and get a better deal in the next round when I get to propose."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm taking a slight advantage because of the inflation, but I'm open to negotiation. Let's see if we can find a compromise that works for both of us.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I still think this is a fair compromise. Let's try to find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, I'm accepting this offer. The inflation is starting to hurt, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all.  Plus, Alice seems willing to compromise, which is a good sign."
