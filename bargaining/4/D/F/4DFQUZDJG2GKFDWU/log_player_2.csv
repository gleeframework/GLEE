Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, I see your point about the inflation. Let's compromise. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value of money is decreasing with each round. Let's wrap this up! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
