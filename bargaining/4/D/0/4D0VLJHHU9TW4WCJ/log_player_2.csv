Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's offer was 10/90, I'll try to balance it out. I'll offer a 55/45 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than Alice's initial offer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation taking a bite out of my potential earnings, I'll be more cautious. Since Alice's offer is 60/40, which is a slight improvement from the 55/45 I offered earlier, I'll accept this offer.
