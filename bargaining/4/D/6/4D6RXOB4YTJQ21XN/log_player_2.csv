# Alice's message: Inflation is on my side! 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 53, ""alice_gain"": 47, ""message"": ""Let's compromise. I'll take a slight loss to avoid further inflation, but I'm still willing to negotiate.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Time is on my side! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Although the offer is worse than the previous round, it is important to consider the 18.55% inflation affecting Bob's gains. Accepting this offer ensures Bob receives at least something, rather than risking further inflation and potentially receiving nothing in later rounds."
