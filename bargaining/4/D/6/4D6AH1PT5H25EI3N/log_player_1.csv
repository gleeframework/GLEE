"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

This offer gives me a significant share of the money, but also leaves Bob with a small amount. This might encourage him to accept the offer, especially considering the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer gives me a significant amount of money, and it's a fair split. Accepting this offer ensures I get a substantial amount, and the risk of further inflation means I could potentially lose more if I keep rejecting offers."
