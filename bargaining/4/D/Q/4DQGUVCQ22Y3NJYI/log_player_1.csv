"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you 20% and take the rest.""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent share of the money, and we can see how the game unfolds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'm hoping to do better in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less, the numbers are:

Alice gain: $100,000
Bob gain: $855,000

I'll reject this offer, as it's a very uneven split in Bob's favor. I'll try to do better in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not going for a lowball offer this time. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

This way, I'm offering a more substantial share to Bob, while still trying to get a decent amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more this time. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 14.26% less than in the first round, the numbers are:

Alice gain: $400,000
Bob gain: $522,000

I'll accept this offer, as it's a fair compromise and I'm getting a decent share of the money. Plus, it's getting late in the game, and I don't want to risk going into the last few rounds with a low offer.
