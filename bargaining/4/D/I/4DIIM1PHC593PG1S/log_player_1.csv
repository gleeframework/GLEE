"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can split the remaining 12 rounds between us!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a small amount, hoping he'll accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, a fair start! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the $500,000 I'd gain is now worth $475,000.

I'm not sure if 50/50 is the best deal for me, considering I could potentially gain more in future rounds. I'll reject this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the $1,000,000 is now worth $950,000 to me.

Here's my offer for round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob! I'm being generous.""
}
```

I'm trying to increase my share while still keeping some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but don't expect more! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the $1,000,000 is now worth $857,000 to me.

I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, but it's a bit better than my previous offer. Considering the decreasing value of money with each round, I'll accept this offer.
