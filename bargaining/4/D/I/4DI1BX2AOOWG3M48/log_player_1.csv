"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, my potential gain is worth 10% less, so I need to be cautious. Since Bob's offer is the same as the one I made in the first round, but with the opposite split, I'll reject it.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, my offer in this round will be worth 10% less than in the first round. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000
}
```

This time, I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share to account for the decreased value of the money."
