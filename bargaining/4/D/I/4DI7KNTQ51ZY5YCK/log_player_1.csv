Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  Accept this offer, and we both walk away with something substantial. Don't be greedy, inflation is hurting us both. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:**  The longer the game continues, the more Bob's share is devalued by inflation. However, this also puts pressure on him to accept a deal sooner rather than later.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  While my offer in Round 3 was better for me, Bob rejecting it suggests he's willing to gamble a bit more. Continuing to hold out for a significantly larger share might not be realistic.
* **Guaranteed Return:** Accepting the current offer guarantees a reasonable sum of $550,000. Rejecting it carries the risk of Bob offering even less in subsequent rounds, potentially leading to a worse outcome in the long run. 

It's a balance between risk and potential reward, and at this stage, securing a reasonable amount outweighs the potential of getting a slightly better deal later."
