"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose to take $9,000 and give Bob $1,000.  This is a fair starting point considering the inflation risk.  Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, accepting Bob's offer is the best course of action. With the 20% inflation, my potential gain in the next round would be significantly lower, and there's no guarantee Bob will offer anything better."
