"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous. Let's start with a good split, but if you reject, I'll be more ruthless next time. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While it's tempting to take the 100,000, it's too early to give in.  Bob can likely get a better deal later on, especially since Alice has threatened to be more ruthless."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Let's be fair. This is a 60/40 split, a good starting point for both of us.  If you reject,  we'll both get less in the next round.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your fairness, Bob, but I believe we can both do better. Let's try a 60/40 split in my favor this time. Remember, the money is losing value with each round, so we need to find a solution quickly. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice is now offering a 60/40 split in her favor, but the value of the money is decreasing for her more than it is for me. Accepting this offer guarantees me a decent amount of money, and it avoids the risk of getting a worse deal in the next round. While I'd prefer a 50/50 split, this is a good compromise."
