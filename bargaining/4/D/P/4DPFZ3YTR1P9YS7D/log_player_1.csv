"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a proposal that gives me a decent chunk of the money, but not so much that Bob will reject it outright.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced values due to inflation, Bob's offer is quite even-handed. I'll consider it carefully.

I'll decide to:
