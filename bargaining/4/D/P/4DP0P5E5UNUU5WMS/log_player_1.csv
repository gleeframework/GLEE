"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take 90% and you can have 10%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 9:1 split in my favor, with me getting 900,000 dollars and Bob getting 100,000 dollars. I'm framing it as a ""fair split"" to see if Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I was expecting a counteroffer, but Bob wants to meet in the middle!

Since the money is worth 5% less now, my gain of 500,000 is actually worth 0.95 * 500,000 = 475,000 dollars.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
