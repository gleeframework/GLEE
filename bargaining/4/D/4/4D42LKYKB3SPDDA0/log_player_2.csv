"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90, and you get 10.  I'm sure we can find a better solution for both of us as we go along.

# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 70,
""alice_gain"": 30,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer was a bit imbalanced. Let's be more realistic. I propose a 70/30 split in my favor.  This round is your best chance to get a decent share before inflation eats into your potential gains.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, I see you're playing hardball.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, but 70/30 is simply too much. Let's split it 45/55. This is still a good deal for you, considering inflation. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
