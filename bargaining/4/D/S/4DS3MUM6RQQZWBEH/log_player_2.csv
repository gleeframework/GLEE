Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation is affecting your share, I think it's reasonable to adjust the split in my favor. Let's settle this now! 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Given the significant impact of inflation on your share, I believe this split is now more than fair. It's time to conclude the game! 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a more even split, the inflation has significantly reduced my potential gains. Accepting this offer ensures I get at least something, while rejecting it risks getting nothing in the end."
