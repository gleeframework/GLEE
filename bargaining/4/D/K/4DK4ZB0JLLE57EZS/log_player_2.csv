"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 600000/400000 split. Let's divide the money fairly. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
Let's see if we can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""I think this is a fairer split, considering the inflation rate favors me more. Let's end this quickly.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose an equal split of the money, considering the inflation rates and aiming for fairness. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, an equal split is a fair outcome given the inflation rates and the potential for further losses with each round."
