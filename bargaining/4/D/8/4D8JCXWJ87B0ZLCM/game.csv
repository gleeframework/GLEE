40.0,60.0,"I appreciate the offer of an even split, but it doesn't make sense with the inflation working against me. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  Let's make a deal and not risk losing everything as the rounds go on.",Bob,2,

55.0,45.0,"I understand your point about inflation, Bob.  Let's compromise. I'll take a slightly smaller share to ensure we both get something.  How about 55/45?  It's still a fair split, and we can avoid the risk of losing everything with each passing round.",Alice,3,

35.0,65.0,"Alice, we're running out of time, and the value is literally evaporating with each round.  My offer is 65/35. Take it now, and we both walk away with something substantial. Don't let greed cloud your judgment â€“ another rejection and we're both staring at zero.",Bob,4,

45.0,55.0,"Bob, we're both losing money with each round. Let's be reasonable and meet in the middle. I'm willing to accept a 45/55 split to ensure we both get something before it's too late.",Alice,5,
