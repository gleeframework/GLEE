Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

This is a tough situation. While the offer is far from fair, it's the last chance to get anything substantial. In the next round, the inflation will eat even more into potential gains, making accepting a worse offer then the current one the only rational choice."
