"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

This is a fairly generous offer, but I'm hoping to get the majority of the $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the effective values are:
Alice gain: $60 × 0.95 = $57
Bob gain: $40 × 0.95 = $38

I'll accept this offer.
