"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and let's seal the deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $30, which is a fair share considering I'm taking the larger portion. My message is a friendly nudge to encourage him to accept the offer and end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle, a fair and simple proposal! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth 5% less, so the numbers are now:

Alice gain: 50 * 0.95 = 47.5
Bob gain: 50 * 0.95 = 47.5

I accept Bob's offer for Round 2. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
