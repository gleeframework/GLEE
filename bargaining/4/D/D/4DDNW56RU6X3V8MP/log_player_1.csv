"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving us both $5,000 each."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm not being too generous yet! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, I'll be gaining the same amount as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 5% less.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. I'm hoping for a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm not giving away too much!""
}
```

I'm increasing my offer to $5,500, which is still a relatively fair split, but I'm trying to get a bit more for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you in the middle, but I'm not giving up yet! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, Bob's gain is worth even less now, and I'm still gaining the same amount as in the first round.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. Meeting in the middle seems like a reasonable compromise, and I'm not willing to risk going to another round."
