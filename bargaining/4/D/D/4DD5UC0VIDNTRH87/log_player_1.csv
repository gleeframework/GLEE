"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a proposal. Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}

This means I'm offering to take 70% of the $100, leaving Bob with 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money, my gain of 55 is now worth 55% of 90% of the original $100, which is $49.50.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
